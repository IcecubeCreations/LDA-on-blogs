Top 20 Free, Open Source and Premium Stream Analytics Platforms


Technology has made it possible for organizations to generate more data from connected sources such as sensors and devices. More and more real-time information has become available and many organizations are using applications that generate actionable insights.
With the increasing use of the cloud, applications, sensors, machines, networks, mobile devices, and the Internet of Things (IoT), organizations are looking for a way to make the most of the insights generated by real-time data. They also need to perform cloud-based stream processing in real-time. Organizations can use different tools to capture and analyze their data.
The best option is to implement a high-performance platform that can analyze data in real-time. There are different types of stream analytics platforms with different features and benefits. Businesses can choose the appropriate stream analytics platform and capitalize on the different features depending on their needs.
What are the Best Open Source Stream Analytics Platforms: Apache Samza, Apache Flink, Apache Spark, Apache Storm are some of the Top Open Source Stream Analytics Platforms
What are the Best Top Stream Analytics Platforms: Striim, Salford Systems SPM, SAS Event Stream Processing, Cisco Connected Streaming Analytics, WSO2 Complex Event Processor, FICO Data Management Solutions, Software AG Apama Streaming Analytics, Azure Stream Analytics, SQLstream, Oracle Stream Analytics, Think Enterprise Data Miner , IBM Streams, SAP Event Stream Processor, Informatica, StreamAnalytix, TIBCO Event Processing are some of the Top Stream Analytics Platforms.
What are Stream Analytics Platforms?
Stream Analytics helps to develop and deploy solutions to gain real time insights from devices, sensors, and applications by real time stream processing in the cloud. Stream Analytics enables to perform real time analytics for Internet of Things solutions, stream millions of events per second, provide mission critical reliability and performance, also deliver real time dashboards and alerts over data from devices and applications, correlate across multiple streams of data and use SQL based language for development. Stream Analytics customers deploy and monitor streaming jobs.
Applications of stream analytics includes personalized, real-time stock-trading analysis and alerts offered by financial services companies, real-time fraud detection; data and identity protection services, analysis of data generated by sensors and actuators, web clickstream analytics, customer relationship management (CRM) alerts, supply chain alerts, transportation alerts.
Stream analytics platforms allow organizations to develop and implement solutions in order to provide insights from different sources of data such as applications, mobile devices, sensors, and machines in real-time. Organizations use these platforms to perform cloud-based stream processing and analytics for IoT in real-time.
Streaming analytics enables organizations to carry out real-time analyses of data and process millions of transactions or events that conventional technologies cannot process. The most effective stream analytics platforms can perform thousands to millions of transactions or events per second. They help businesses to develop the applications needed to perform critical missions in an efficient and timely manner.
Users of these platforms can also access dashboards and receive alerts in real-time based on data from applications and different devices. The alerts may come from financial service providers, stock markets, identity protection service providers, supply chains, CRM systems, and fraud detection systems. Businesses can develop real-time solutions based on the data collected and analyzed on the cloud.
What are the features of Stream Analytics Platforms?
The best stream analytics platforms include the following features:

Dashboards: Data visualization is an important component of stream analytics platforms. Dashboards make it possible to visualize data in the form of graphs, images, and tables that show the most important figures. The best dashboards allow users to dig deeper to identify problems and develop solutions.
Real-time Data Analysis and Reporting: Stream analytics platforms include a feature for analyzing data in motion. The most powerful platforms can process millions of transactions per second. Real-time reports enable quick responses and instant decisions.
Anywhere Access: Users are able to access the platform and make informed decisions regardless of their location. You don’t have to be in the office to access reports and make critical decisions.
Compatibility with Different Data Sources: The best stream analytics platforms are compatible with the existing systems. They can also capture data from different sources such as spreadsheets, CRM, ERP, payroll, accounting, and database systems.
Simplicity: This is an important feature because it ensures that anyone can use the platform regardless of their background in IT.

Stream analytics platforms have the following benefits:

Companies can effectively manage their key performance indicators by visualizing data in real-time.
Businesses can gain insight into the behaviours of their customers.
Businesses can become more competitive by analyzing trends, identifying threats, generating forecasts, and making critical decisions.

Apache Samza



Apache Samza is a distributed stream processing framework. It uses Apache Kafka for messaging, and Apache Hadoop YARN to provide fault tolerance, processor isolation, security, and resource management. Unlike most low-level messaging system APIs, Samza provides a very simple callback-based “process message” API comparable to MapReduce. Samza manages snapshotting and restoration of a stream processor’s state. When the processor is restarted, Samza restores its state to a consistent snapshot. Samza is built to handle large amounts of state (many gigabytes per partition). Whenever a machine in the cluster fails, Samza works with YARN to transparently migrate your tasks to another…
Bottom LineSamza is built to handle large amounts of state (many gigabytes per partition). Whenever a machine in the cluster fails, Samza works with YARN to transparently migrate your tasks to another machine.
