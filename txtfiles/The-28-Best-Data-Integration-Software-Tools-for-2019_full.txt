The 28 Best Data Integration Software Tools for 2019
Posted on November 28, 2018 by Timothy King in Best Practices 



Like many of the categories we cover at Solutions Review, the one constant always seems to be change. Traditional data integration providers continue to offer legacy capabilities for bulk/batch, message-oriented movement, and replication. However, the space has split into two distinct categories, one for on-prem tools, and the other for cloud-based Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS).
Traditional products, like those offered by HVR, IBM, and Adeptia, still reign supreme in large, enterprise settings, but face increased competition from cloud SaaS vendors such as Dell Boomi, Jitterbit, and SnapLogic. In an attempt to assist you with what can become a daunting task of selecting the right product, these are the top-28 best data integration software tools for 2019.

Actian DataConnect allows organizations to integrate with cloud, on-prem, mobile, or IoT data using hundreds of pre-built connectors. DataCloud enables users to connect to any endpoint and automatically expand service reach on-demand. Last April, Actian released Actian X, a hybrid database that combines the Actian Ingres OLTP database with its Vector query engine. The company unveiled Apache Spark support in its Vector in Hadoop tool shortly after. Actian offers a niche selection of data integration and data management tools.
Key Features:

Hybrid Agent: Actian DataCloud connects to on-prem databases and applications without moving data to the cloud.
Business Xchange: Actian Business Xchange is a full-managed B2B integration service that enables trading partners to exchange electronic procurement and supply chain documents regardless of format or enterprise system.
PointConnect: PointConnect enables point-to-point integration between two specific applications by providing pre-built workflow templates to expedite mapping and data transformations.

Adeptia offers a broad spectrum of data integration capabilities in several deployment methods. Its traditional, on-prem product is considered to be one of the best in the market. However, Adeptia’s cloud-based Integration Platform as a Service product has not yet been recognized in the same breath as its competitors. Adeptia’s tools are also lacking in interoperability with other data management solutions. However, what Adeptia does, it does well, and buyers report that the company’s integration tools are attractively priced compared to other providers in the space.
Key Features:

Data Mapper: Data mapper is a web-based, graphical design tool that eases the tasks of specifying ETL, mapping, validation, and data cleansing rules to process incoming information.
