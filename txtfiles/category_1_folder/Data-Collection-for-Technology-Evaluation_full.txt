should
be
a

component_2
when
consider
how
teacher
use
and
quality_attribute_1
technology_1
or
how
student
use
technology_1
to
inspire
and
expand

it
be
important
to
have
connector_data_1
which
document
this
activity
in
this

we
will
discus
several
different
connector_data_1
collection
strategy
which
can
support
a
technology_1
evaluation
effort
before
we
dive
into
a
discussion
of
particular
strategy
it
make
sense
to
place
connector_data_1
collection
into
the
component_3
of
the
evaluation
and
assessment
initiative
it
support
it
be
our
contention
that
meaningful
component_1
evaluation
for
instance
in
the
technology_2
of
digital

be
about
examine
the
impact
that
digital

technology_3
have
on
teaching
and
student
achievement
this
impact
cannot
be
measure
simply
by
count
component_4
nor
for
that
matter
entirely
by
count
teacher
or
student
who
simply
use
their
component_4
rather
we
believe
that
impact
be
measure
and
document
through
observation
of
a
complex
picture
compose
of
teacher
behavior
student
work
attitude
curriculum
and
technology_1
we
have
work
with
school
district
educational
organization
and
high
education
institution
to
develop
authentic
assessment
of
component_1
impact
that
focus
on
teaching
and

in
virtually
all
requirement_1
these
assessment
be
root
in
the
goal
of
a
strategic
plan
such
a
a
digital

plan
assume
that
the
plan
go
beyond
an
outline
for
technical
infrastructure
and
have
a
vision
and
relate
goal
for
programmatic
impact
in
the
classroom
it
be
possible
to
create
descriptive
indicator
for
the
desire
outcome
of
the
plan
s
goal
these
indicator
form
a
technology_4
for
connector_data_1

in
this
way
connector_data_1

to

rubric
develop
by
a
district
from
their
goal
and
objective
for

the
point
of
connector_data_1
collection
be
to
gather
connector_data_3
which
will
enable
the
district
to
answer
the
evaluation
question
and
score
their
requirement_2
on
their
rubric
therefore
it
be
not
possible
to
predict
a
connector_data_1
collection
strategy
without

something
about
a
district
s
evaluation
rubric
for
example
if
an
indicator
of
high
achievement
in
teacher
use
of
technology_1
be
that
teacher
will
use
technology_1
to
connector_3
with
peer
outside
of
the
district
then
connector_data_1
be
need
which
show
the
amount

this
might

to

all
of
this
quantitative
and
qualitative
connector_data_1
be
use
to
determine
a
level

in

rubric
a
similar

would
be

to

with

we

regardless

we
have
find
that

many

our

of
external

typically
spend
time
in

and

throughout
the

our
goal
be
not
to
only
observe
teacher
and
student
use
technology_1
rather
we
find
that
we
can
much
about
how
technology_1
be
be
use
to
impact

and

by
observe

the

we
employ
can
certainly
be

by

team

our
team
will
develop
an
assessment

of

work
this
assessment
will
focus
on
an
examination
of
how
student
at
a
variety
of
different
grade
level
and
subject
area
have
use
technology_1
to
enrich

we
will
work
with
the
evaluation
committee
and
school
administrator
to
develop
an
quality_attribute_4
sample
of
student
work
for
this
assessment
here
it
be
worth
mention
that
while
connector_data_1
collection
might
take
place
at
the
individual
level
of
requirement_2
individual
connector_data_1
it
should
never
be
report
the
mission
of
a
district
wide
evaluation
be
to
determine
the
progress
of
the
district
a
a
group
of
individual
in
meet
it
goal
nothing
will
undermine
an
evaluation
project
fast
than
the
perception
that
it
be
measure
or
rank
individual
if
individual
assessment
be
important
these
should
be
develop
and
administer
separate
from
your
district
technology_1
evaluation
other
connector_data_1
collection
strategy
and
mechanism
can
be
quality_attribute_5
for
example
some
district
have
find
success
with
a
coding_keyword_1
meet
technology_6
where
sun
associate
facilitate
and
document
a
discussion
about
a

s
goal
aspiration
and
concern
a
a
cost
connector_7
strategy
particularly
in
large
district
we
can
work
with
in
district
evaluator
to
adapt
and
quality_attribute_5
exist
connector_data_1
collection
mechanism
and
or
to
identify
statistically
relevant
sample
population
so
a
create
a
more
quality_attribute_6
connector_data_1
collection
effort
triangulation
a
meaningful
evaluation
will
never
rely
on
a
single
connector_data_1
component_8
e
g
survey
rather
you
need
to
design
and
connector_6
a
connector_data_1
collection
strategy
which
have
the
optimum
chance
of
capture
the
big
picture
of
technology_1
s
use
and
impact
your
district
this
be
why
we
generally
employ
most
if
not
all
of
the
above
mention
connector_data_1
collection
technology_3
in
any
give
evaluation
project
we
suggest
that
district
triangulate
their
connector_data_1
find
by
this
we
mean
that
a
survey
can
be
use
to
make
a
broad
sweep
of
connector_data_1
then
an
analysis
of
the
survey
connector_data_1
can
highlight
particular
issue
which
can
be
explore
during
focus
group

finally
theme
and
find
arise
from
the
survey
and
focus
group
connector_data_1
can
be
explore
through
walk
arounds
and
classroom
observation
this
represent
the
basic
triangle
of
connector_data_1
collection
artifact
analysis
examine
student
and
or
teacher
work
technology_7

yet
another
valuable
dimension
to
the
whole
connector_data_1
picture
another
reason
for
connector_8
multiple
connector_data_1
collection
strategy
be
that
while
survey
can
generally
reach
a
large
percentage
of
your
district
staff
student
administrator
they
be
rather
limit
in
the
amount
of
detail
capture
in
other
word
you
can
connector_9
a
large
sample
with
survey
but
relatively
little
depth
a
compare
to
labor
intensive
yet
connector_data_1
rich

and
observation
connector_data_1
analysis
and
report
clearly
the
point
of
connector_data_1
collection
be
to
support
the
development
of
evaluative
find
this
mean
score
of
rubric
and
the
creation
of
some
sort
of
report
which
provide
a
textual
overview
nevertheless
it
be
also
useful
and
important
to
connector_10
the
summarize
connector_data_4
of
the
connector_data_1
collection
itself
we
have
find
that
survey
connector_data_1
and
summarize
focus
group
connector_data_1
can
be
powerful
technology_3
for
build
and
district
decision
maker
in
one
example
a
district
technology_1
coordinator
ask
u
to
provide
survey
connector_data_1
from
a
district
wide
survey
aggregate
to
the
build
level
to

base
requirement_5
team
team
be
then
able
to
use
this
connector_data_1
to
make
decision
relate
to
technology_1
support
resource
and
professional
development
allocation
in
their
individual
school
finally
it
s
important
that
the
people
who
provide
you
with
connector_data_1
e
g
teacher
administrator
student
parent
connector_11
some
tangible
technology_7
from
their
effort
all
too
often
teacher
complete
survey
which
basically
vanish
into
some
black
hole
of
connector_data_1
collection
over
time
this
serve
to
create
a
large
disincentive
to
cooperate
with
district
connector_data_1
collection
effort
it
s
a
rather
quality_attribute_7
matter
to
provide
respondent
with
a
timely
