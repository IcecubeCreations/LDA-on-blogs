you
also
need
to
be

component_10
you
even
need
re

of

more
often
than
you
would

in

such
a
in

be
down
for
some

a
b
test
with

version
of
an

a
component_9
that
need
to
connector_18
the
connector_data_1
from

or
build
different
analytic
component_20
via

base
on
the

think
about

more
use

that
you
can
build
easily
with
a
real

component_5
that
be
still
a

connector_2

sell

you
name
it—the
connector_data_7
go

now
you
understand
the
requirement_16
of
a

so
do
i
have
to
introduce
this
a

caution
no

successfully
component_8

everywhere
go
step
by
step
from
pre
connector_1
to
connector_2
component_3
if
you
come
from
the
component_16
age
then
you
might
even
have
pattern_3
and
non
connector_1
component_6
forever
or
realistically
at

for
the
next
year
that’s
fine
you
need
to
bring
the
from
these
component_7
into

central

component_5
the
follow
show
the
connector_2
maturity
component_24
that
we
use
to
identify

that’s

fine
the
next
section
explain
why
almost

leverage

a

introduce

a

often
people
be

a
it
have
be

successful
open_source

create
at

for

requirement_14
that
be
the

and
one
of
many
use

today
technology_2
quality_attribute_11
from

ingestion
pattern_12
to
a

connector_2

for
all
the
use
requirement_3
previously
discus
many
project
focus
on

mission
critical
component_6
around
technology_2
it
have
to
be
up
and
performant
if
technology_2
be
down
their
requirement_4
component_23
stop
work
technology_2
be
unique
because
it
combine
connector_data_4
storage
and
component_10
of
all
in
one
component_3
it
do
this
in
a
quality_attribute_6

use
a

connector_20
requirement_12
and
topic
divide
into

component_32
a
see
below
with
this
quality_attribute_6
architecture
technology_2
be
different
from
exist
requirement_5

pattern_9
solution
not
only
be
it
massively
quality_attribute_5
and
build
for
high
quality_attribute_12
but
different

can
also

independently

other
and
in

component_6
publish
connector_data_1
a
a
connector_1
of
while
other
component_6
pick
up
that
connector_1
and
connector_18
it
when
they
want
because
all
be
component_21
component_6
can
hook
into
this
connector_1
and
connector_18
a
required—in
pattern_3
real
time
or
near
real
time
this
mean
that
you
can
truly
decouple
component_7
and
enable
proper
agile
development
furthermore
a
component_5
can
subscribe
to
the
connector_1
and
catch
up
with
historic
connector_data_1
up
until
the
present
before
exist
component_7
be
properly
decommission
the

of

so
we

evaluate

the

be

at

you
name

to
see
how
they
use
technology_2
it
be
everywhere
even
“traditional”
requirement_6
in
bank

telco
retail

use

to

to
name
a

be
quality_attribute_17
on
the

don’t
waste
your
time
with
pocs
about
requirement_17
maturity
or
quality_attribute_9
instead
evaluate
how
to
quality_attribute_2
technology_2
into
your
requirement_1
architecture
to
quality_attribute_11
requirement_4
scenario
and
innovate
towards
digital
transformation
should
we
replace
our

deployment
young
requirement_6
netflix

and
zalando
build
their
whole

on
technology_2
old
requirement_6
be
not
that
fortunate
because
they
have
plenty
of
component_16
monolith
and
component_8
technology_7
however
a
discus
a
big
bang
replacement
be
not
the
right
way
to
be
successful
it’s
a
lot
transform
your
home
although
it
might
make
sense
in
theory
to
rebuild
it
from
the
grind
up
oftentimes
it
be
more
practical
to
extend
the
house
connector_9
certain
room
or
redecorate
it’s
difficult
to
rip
and
replace
mission
critical
component_6
that
be
deeply
quality_attribute_2
with
other
component_37
that
work
and
involve
a
skilled
team
operate
them
that
say
sometimes
it
be
more
cost
quality_attribute_18
to
replace
component_8
architecture
it
sometimes
do
make
sense
to
remodel
a
house
from
the
grind
up
this
be
the
requirement_3
with
sberbank
the
big
bank
in
russia
which
build
their
complete
core

component_5
around

you
cannot
simply
turn

this
have

component_8

co

to
run
the

and
offer
to

innovate
by

your

via

e
the

use

capture

such
a
an
esb
or
technology_5
with
great
graphical
technology_6
and
connector
for
component_8
component_9
with
this
foundation
you
can
build

with
modern

requirement_11
component_5
requirement_10
etc
natively
around

technology_2
and
at
the

time
keep
connector_21
to
your

which
you
still
need
for
requirement_16
in
project
real
decouple
and

independence
also
mean
that
you
have
dumb

and
smart
if
you
build
all
the
requirement_5
component_38
or
even
bad
some
requirement_4
component_38
into

central
requirement_5
pattern_12
then
all
your
quality_attribute_9
agility
and
independence
of
the

component_7
be

this
be
a
key
difference
to
traditional

you
put

be
anything
you
can

any

technology_23
or
go
you
can
also
use
any
other
component_9
to
quality_attribute_2
other
component_6
with

the
secret
to
long
term
success
be
that
the

be
open
to
any
technology_7

architectural
pattern_7
technology_5
and

bapi

etc
trust
me
you
don’t
want
to
connector_15
the

it
be
already
run

and
quality_attribute_2
therefore
exist
mq

which
already
quality_attribute_2
with
your

world
be
not

to

rather
they
be
complementary
leverage
them
you
do
in

to
quality_attribute_2

you
can

all

i
quote
thoughtworks
to
remind
you
not
to
try
build
a
esb
around
technology_2
some
organization
recreate
esb
antipatterns
with
technology_2
by
centralizing
the
technology_2
ecosystem
components—such
a
connector
and
connector_1
processors—instead
of
allow
these
component_36
to
live
with
technology_25
or
component_1
team
this
remind
u
of
seriously
problematic
esb
antipatterns
where
more
and
more
component_38
pattern_17
and
transformation
be
thrust
into
a
centrally
manage
esb
create
a
significant
connector_4
on
a
centralized
team
we’re
connector_23
this
out
to
dissuade
further
implementation
of
this
flaw
pattern_7
component_2
technology_1
technology_2
and
it
ecosystem
be
design
a
a

with

smart

in
to
allow
high

high

build

ksql
and
any
other
technology_2
component_12
technology_33
quality_attribute_2
technology_2
with

and
technology_5
technology_6
if
you
need
their
feature
for
specific
component_8
requirement_5
an
esb
or
technology_5
component_10
can
be
a
component_2
or
connector_11
to
technology_1
technology_2
any
other
technology_2
component_28
or
component_26
technology_33
oftentimes
the
requirement_5
with
component_8
component_7
use
such
a
technology_6
be
build
and
run
already
anyway
currently
all
these
technology_6
also
have
a
technology_2
connector
because
the
requirement_8
drive
them
this
way
so
you
need
to
combine
the
exist
requirement_5
with
the
technology_2
connector
and
there
you
have
it
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_5
and
highly
quality_attribute_17
requirement_5
between
component_8
and
future
ecosystem
through
technology_2
technology_1

between
component_8
and
the
modern

technology_1
technology_2
be
an

that
allow
you
to
build
a
quality_attribute_5

infrastructure
that
quality_attribute_2
component_8
and
modern
component_6
in
a
quality_attribute_4
decouple

it
be
already
battle
test
for
component_10
trillion
of
connector_data_8
and
petabyte
of
connector_data_1
per

simply
leverage
the
technology_1
technology_2
ecosystem
in
your

architecture
to
make

of
your
various
component_7
successful
and
dynamic
but
whatever
you
do
do
not
try
to
build
an
esb
around
kafka—it
be
an
anti
pattern_7
that
will
create
inflexibility
and
unwanted
connector_4
instead
leverage
the
quality_attribute_6

of
the

to
