this
before
convert
your

to
a
voicebotthere
be
tell
difference
between
text
and
voice
interfacesconversational
componentsfirstly
we
need
to
think
of
any
conversation
be
it
in
voice
or
text
of
be
present
to
the
component_1
by
mean
of
conversational
component_2
conversational
component_3
be
the
different
element
or
affordances
if
you

quality_attribute_1
within
a
specific

for
instance
within
messenger
there
be

carousel

quick
connector_data_1
and
the


messenger
with
feature
rich
conversational
componentsthese
allow
the
developer
to
leverage
these
conversational
component_3
to
the
maximum
hence
negate
any
notion
of
a
pure
natural
technology_1
conversational

it
be
merely
a
graphic
live
within
a
conversational

or
if
you

a
graphic
component_1
make
quality_attribute_1
within
a
conversational
container
be
this
wrong…no
it
be
take
the
to
the
user’s
of
choice
hence
make
it
more
quality_attribute_2
and
remove
the
friction
component_4
present
the
problem
with
such
an
approach
be
that
you
be
heavily
dependent
on
the
affordances
of
the

should
you
want
to
roll
your
requirement_1
out
on
whatsapp
the
same
conversational
component_3
will
obviously
not
be
quality_attribute_1
and
you
will
have
to
lean
more
on
nlu
keyword
spot
or
a
drive
solution
with
a
even
more
basic
sm
be
be
really
dependent
on
nlu
or
a

with

the

or

the

the
component_1
need
to
input
to
navigate
the
ui
be
it
a
requirement_1
technically
yes
a
it
life
in
a
multi
component_5
pattern_1
conversational

but
be
it
conversational
in
nature
one
would
have
to
argue
no
so
in
the
second
example
a
rudimentary
approach
need
to
be
follow
for
one
single
reason
the
do
not
afford
the
rich
requirement_2
and
be
primarily
text
base
with
voice
these
component_3
disappear
completely
with
only
the
natural
technology_1
component_2
quality_attribute_1
within
the

component_1
vui
environment
there
be
no
component_3
to

the

component_6
to

the

the
freedom
to

any

component_1
transition
to
textoften
where
there
be
no
visual
affordances
no
implicit
guidance
can
be
give
to
the
component_1
due
to
the
nascent
nature
of
voice

it
be
virtually
impossible
to
leverage
exit
experience
or
knowledge
of
the
component_1
due
to
the
strong
association
of
conversation
with
human
and
not
component_7
the
expectation
of
the
component_1
be
often
much
high
than
the
capability
of
the

hence
in
most
requirement_3
the
component_1
output
exceed
the
design
of

there
be
a
certain
level
of
patience
and
perseverance
require
from
the
component_1
to
build
an
affinity
and
sympathy
voice
connector_3
deviceresearch
have
show
that
component_6
opt
for
speech
input
while
drive
or
at
home
wherever
the
component_1
feel
the
need
to
have
a
private
conversation
they
opt
for
text
this
be
usually
at
work
transport
in
general
wait

or
in

alexa
requirement_4
to
the
mercedes
benz
car
apiusers
will
expect
to
have
a
seamless
experience
between
the
different

of
voice
and
text
an
element
which
should
not
be
underestimate
be
the
advance
in
microphone
technology_2
when
it
come
to
the
echo
component_8
and
home
this
allow
for
quality_attribute_3
asr
to
be
perform
on
the
voice
prior
to
intent
and
mean
discovery
some
requirement_5
be
look
at
have
a
conversational
experience
over
a
telephone
connector_data_2
which
be
not
really
feasible
a
requirement_6
component_9
will
perform
much
quality_attribute_4
but
still
not
a
quality_attribute_4
a
a
dedicate
component_8
voice
be
ephemeralconversation
which
live
within
a
text
chat
environment
whatsapp
messenger
etc
afford
the
component_1
the
opportunity
to
refer
back
to
conversation
history
this
allow
for
text
conversation
to
be
multi
component_5
and
pattern_1
while
component_6
be
chat
with
your
requirement_1
they
be
simultaneously
chat
to
other
people
or
requirement_7

echo
speech
interfacea
voice
conversation
be
not
multi
component_5
from
a
user’s
perspective
the
component_1
can
only
have
one
conversation
at
a
time
but
more
importantly
it
be
pattern_2
the
conversation
be
usually
start
and
end
and
be
conduct
in
time
the
duration
of
the
voice
conversation
be
normally
short
also
by
ephemeral
i
mean
that
the
smart
assistant
dialog
evaporate
hence
study
show
that
component_10
be
more
likely
to
transact
on
text
requirement_7
than
voice
requirement_7
while
it
be
true
that
component_6
can
refer
to
a
companion
component_9
for
the
conversation
transcript
this
be
not
do
during
the
conversation
often
a
requirement_1
can
dispatch
a
number
of
speech
bubble
each
contain
quite
a
bit
of
content
this
will
not
work
for
a
voice
requirement_7
for
voice
the
speech
from
the
voice
requirement_7
will
have
to
be
one
utterance
one
speech
bubble
if
you

and
the
text
must
be
shorten
some
element
url’s
phone
number
connector_4
etc
will
not
suffice
and
in
such
requirement_3
an
component_1
need
to
be
refer
to
a
companion
component_9
or
the
connector_data_3
can
be
texted
for
instance

echo
with
different
languagesany
graphic
display
present
by
the
text
requirement_7
will
have
to
be
remove
for
the
voice
experience
should
the
voice
requirement_7
have
a
display

home
hub
or
echo
show
the
connector_data_4
will
have
to
be
adapt
for
the

also
keep
in
mind
that
component_6
cannot
really
refer
back
to
previous
conversation
so
a
with
a
text
requirement_7
it
might
make
sense
to
preserve
the
state…in
the
requirement_3
of
voice
it
will
most
probably
be
more
helpful
if
the
voice
requirement_7
start
a
conversation
from
scratch
radio
silenceapi
requirement_4
touch
point
should
have
sub
second
connector_5
time
for
a
voice

silence
during
a
conversation
be
disconcert
from
a
user’s
perspective
and
often
lead
to
a
believe
that
the
conversation
have
be
terminate
multi
modal
experience
with
echo
showthis
be
analogousness
to
an
ivr
interactive
voice
connector_5
component_11
front
a
connector_data_2
center
where
any
on
connector_data_2
silence
in
the
ivr
component_12
during
a
pattern_3
be
highly
undesirable
during
a
text
chat
conversation
the
component_1
can
be
entertain
by
“is
typing”
display
a
with
a
human
and
we
be
use
to
wait
on
the
human
on
the
other
side
to
respond
in
text
after
connector_6
our
connector_data_4
hence
there
be
an
expect
delay
hence
the
delay
be
not
that
critical
when
it
come
to
text
base
conversation
a
slight
delay
in
delivery
of
the
dialog
or
text
be
again
not
a
critical
however
in
the
requirement_3
of
voice
a
delay
be
very
counterproductive
conclusionthere
be
this
allure
that
a
text
base
requirement_7
requirement_1
can
merely
be
convert
into
an
component_13
and
be
utilize
by
voice

be
it
ivr
echo
assistant
and
the

but
in
practice
this
be
not
the
requirement_3
a
state
at
the
outset
of
this
story
you
will
always
have
a
mediation
pattern_4
this
mediation
pattern_4
will
sit
between
your
requirement_1
component_13
nlu
component_14
and
the
presentation
pattern_4
comprise
of
the

the
requirement_1
component_13
output
will
be
connector_7
by
the
mediation
pattern_4
and
render
in
a
technology_3
digestible
by
it
be
intend
for
the
be
messenger
whatsapp
text
sm
web
chat
etc
for
voice

more
work
will
be
require
to
ensure
the
text
to
be
speak
back
to
the
component_1
be
suitable
and
consumable
