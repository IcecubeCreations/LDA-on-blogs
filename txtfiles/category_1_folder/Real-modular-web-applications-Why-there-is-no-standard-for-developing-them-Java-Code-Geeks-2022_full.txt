j2ee
and
the
connector_data_2
never
end
all
these
technology_10
promise
to
their
end
component_2
developer
the
same
thing
which
be
more
or
le
technology_2
modular
web
component_3
how
many
of
u
out
there
though
have
actually
try
to
develop
a
real
modular
component_4
in
technology_2
how
many
of
u
have
manage
to
connector_1
it
do
you
have
probably
notice
that
i
have
capitalize
the
word
real
and
this
be
not
do
accidentally
i
shortly
explain
what
i
mean
by
the
definition
“real
modular
technology_2
system”
imho
a
real
should
be
able
to
have
part
for
at
least
requirement_4
component_5
persistence
component_2
and
configuration
a

in
an
ideal
scenario
should
be
able
to
be
plug
in
and
plug
off
easily
in
a
run
component_1
without
restart
it
for
example
in
a
j2ee
component_1
component_6
such
a
technology_9
or
technology_11
the
run
component_1
core
component_4
be
a
war

some
more
that
contain
part
mention
above
of
the
core
component_4
be
develop
and
packaged
in
separate
jar

these
jar
shoule
be
quality_attribute_2
in
the
component_1
component_6
quality_attribute_3
with
the
core
component_4
by
some
extension
point
in
requirement_4
component_5
and
in
component_2
without
the
need
of
re
quality_attribute_2
it
can
we
do
something
this
let’s
see
what
relate
technology_10
suggest
about
it
i
be
a
fan
of
technology_12
since
their
first
step
and
after
the
recent
late
release
of
technology_12
a
i
be
look
connector_2
to
see
them
in
action
to
be
honest
technology_12
provide
a
very
quality_attribute_4
and
convenient
way
to
define
connector_3
between

oops
do
i
connector_4
“modules”
what
kind
of
be
these
they
can
include
requirement_4
component_5
configuration
connector_data_1
component_7
but
what
about
component_2

unfortunately
nothing
be
mention
about
that
and
after
a
little
research
i
have
find
that
the
concept
of
quality_attribute_5
in
technology_12
do
not
include
any
component_2

what
about
technology_13
the
most
promise
way
of
build
moduar
component_1
technology_13
be
nowadays
support
from
many
component_1
component_8
and
although
it
configuration
look
dinosaur
in
the
age
of
industrial
revolution
seem
to
be
a
very
nice
approach
plenty
of
quality_attribute_6
component_9
a
dozen
of
technology_8
to
use
and
of
no
reference
to
any
component_2
capability
on
the
other
hand
there
be
technology_14
that
quality_attribute_3
well
with
technology_13
to
build
modular
web
component_1
a
the
relevant
imply
i
wonder
if
there
be
a
real
productive
modular
requirement_3
component_1
develop
with
technology_13
and
technology_14
technology_3
be
an
independent
technology_8
by
springsource
which
be
currently
the
leader
in
develop
technology_2
requirement_3
component_1
technology_3
dynamic
in
conjuction
with
technology_13
claim
to
be
the
most
sophisticate
way
to
build
dynamic
and
modular
web
component_1
but
again
i
still
feel
that
even
technology_3
be
not
solve
the
problem
i
have
raise
from
my
research
experience
requirement_2
of
the
above
technology_10
for
a
modular
component_4
be
a
hard
connector_data_3
last
but
not
least
come
j2ee
the
late
version
of
web
and
full
profile
specification
have
transform
j2ee
to
a
very
powerful
set
of
technology_8
jsf2
and
technology_15
a
well
a
with
all
the
feature
have
dramatically
increase
it
popularity
among
technology_2
developer
when
i
connector_5
for
the
first
time
this

i
believe
that
finally
i
have
find
a
technology_1
solution
for
modular
web
component_1
although
each
jar
can
contain
all
different
part
requirement_4
component_5
with
technology_16
and
technology_15
persistence
with
technology_17
and
it
implementation
configuration
and
component_2
with
technology_18
and
it
implementation
accord
to
this
issue
there
be
no
way
to
handle
jar
with
technology_18
component_10
a
a
separate

one
more
dissapointment
in
j2ee
be
suppose
to
be
jar
packaged
in
a
single
war
that
be
too
close
we
have
to
wait
i
guess
until
the
release
of
technology_18


and
some
month
late
for
support
of
the
most
well

component_1
component_6
since
there
be
no
technology_1
for
build
modular
component_4
many
well

project
have
develop
their
own
component_4
base
on
one
of
the
previous
mention
technology_8
or
from
the
scratch
technology_19
atlassian’s
jira
and
sonar
by
sonarsource
be
all
technology_2
base
component_3
with
a
powerful
plugin
component_4
you
develop
your
plugin
include
component_2

follow
some
guideline
and
you
quality_attribute_2
it
a
a
single
jar
through
a

plugin
manager
in
most
requirement_5
you
need
to
restart
the
component_4
but
i
think
that
this
do
not
bother
any
administrator
since
you
can
easily
increase
the
requirement_6
of
your

so
my
dilemma
be
still
valid
should
i
start
build
my
own
plugin
component_4
or
should
i
wait
for
a
technology_1
to
come
and
technology_20
the
develop
of
modular
web
component_3
worldwide
i
wonder
why
this
kind
of
standardization
be
not
yet
quality_attribute_6
and
why
we
be
obligate
to
try
catch
finally
still
without
resource
among
all
these
technology_10
and
technology_8
be
we
close
to
have
a
technology_1
for
develop
real
modular
requirement_3
web
component_3
or
not

there
be
no
