abstract
since
the
begin
of
requirement_1
pattern_1
component_1
be
the
most
popular
choice
for
component_1
large
amount
of
generate
connector_data_1
these
exist
component_1
technology_1
be
not
suitable
to
component_1
the
large
amount
of
connector_data_1
we
face
today
research
work
develop
a
variety
of
technology_1
that
focus
on
connector_1
component_1
connector_1
component_1
technology_1
bring
significant
requirement_3
improvement
and
opportunity
to
handle
requirement_1
in
this
paper
we
discus
the
difference
of
pattern_1
and
connector_1
component_1
and
we
explore
exist
pattern_1
and
connector_1
component_1
technology_1
we
also
explain
the
possibility
that
connector_1
component_1
make
possible

introduction
a
huge
amount
of
connector_data_2
be
generate
everyday
by
social

e
mail
sensor
instrument
and
requirement_4
component_4
to
mention
a
few
resource
this
amount
of
connector_data_1
bring
a
lot
of
challenge
accord
to
volume
technology_2
and
variety
in
the
past
two
year
90%
of
all
connector_data_1
be
create
and
the
amount
of
connector_data_1
will
double
every
two
year
this
connector_data_1
come
in
a
variety
of
technology_3
and
type
each
of
it
require
a
diﬀerent
way
to
component_1
the
generate
connector_data_1

pattern_1
component_1
be
the
most
popular
choice
to
component_1
requirement_1
the
most
notable
pattern_1
component_1
technology_4
be
mapreduce

mapreduce
be
first
connector_2
and
develop
by

it
be
use
for
large
quality_attribute_1
graph

component_1
requirement_5
and

translation
mapreduce
can
component_1
large
amount
of
connector_data_1
but
be
only
design
for
pattern_1
component_1
today’s
demand
rely
on
real
time
component_1
of
requirement_1
that
will
ﬁnish
in
second

for
this
demand
various
pattern_2
technology_1
have
be
develop
in
this
paper
we
will
focus
on
technology_5
technology_6
connector_3

and
technology_5
flink

which
be
the
most
famous
technology_7
for
connector_1
component_1

in
this
work
we
will
explain
the
concept
of
pattern_1
component_1
and
connector_1
component_1
in
detail
while
introduce
the
most
popular
technology_4
after
that
we
introduce
opportunity
that
connector_1
component_1
provide
to
face
today’s
issue
where
a
connector_4
be
need
in
second

relate
work
requirement_1
analysis
be
an
active
area
of
research
but
comparison
of
requirement_1
analysis
concept
be
difficult
to
find
most
research
paper
focus
on
compare
connector_1
component_1
technology_4
on
requirement_3
in
this
work
we
will
focus
on
open_source
technology_1
there
be
widely
use
proprietary

paper
we
will
focus
on
the

be
a
key
factor

there
be
two
different
architecture
of
how
pattern_1
should
be
connector_8
a
script
or
a
component_10
the
major
difference
be
requirement_7
and
control
pattern_1
that
will
run
a
a
component_10
usually
report
their
status
through
requirement_7
and
can
be
control
over
a
control
panel
which
be
provide
by
the
component_3
pattern_1
that

connector_12
over
the
command
line
report
their
progress
through
connector_5
and
an
appropriate
exit

the
pattern_1
scheduler
will
terminate
the

it’s
necessary

a

this
approach
cannot
guarantee
that
each

correctly
if
the

processor
die
there
be
no
way
to

a

it
allow

an
example
for

be
technology_5

the

incoming
in

then
connector_data_7
the
real

there
be
two

this
lead
to
inconsistency
when
different

different
connector_data_1
that
arrive
at
different
time
the
component_11
handle
recovery
through
pattern_4
which
require
twice
the
amount
of

this
be
not
optimal
for
