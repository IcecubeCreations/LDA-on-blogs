component_14
quality_attribute_16
component_22
can
include
social

requirement_14
and
others
most
important
of
all
it
can
ensure
the
movement
of

between
any
component_14
and
destination
furthermore
it
also
have
the
capability
for
trace
connector_data_1
in
real

and
it
work
be
quite
similar
to
the
of
up
and
fedex

component_6
every
day
we
come
across
something
in
the
world
of

here
be
the
requirement_2
prediction
state
the
world
of
connector_data_1
requirement_5
connector_6
requirement_5
connector_6
requirement_5
also
deserve
quality_attribute_13
recognition
than
technology_1
for
open_source
real

requirement_5
it
provide
eclipse

development
environment
alongside
support
for
technology_24
technology_5
and
technology_41
programming
technology_42
a
a
connector_data_3
it
make
it
easy
to
develop
real
time
connector_data_1
requirement_5
component_3
the
capability
of
connector_6
requirement_5
be
different
than
other
common
real

connector_data_1
connector_1
technology_1
it
help
in
develop
in
notebook
so
that
technology_5
component_12
can
ensure
effortless
pattern_7
requirement_13
and
inform
decision
make
you
can
use
the
connector_1
component_7
of
connector_1
requirement_5
on

component_8
for
component_20
the
connector_data_5
in
connector_data_1
connector_6
technology_9
connector_1
technology_9
connector_1
be
the
next
important
entry
among
technology_1
for
open_source
real
time
requirement_5
the
connector_6
requirement_5
component_6
have
direct
requirement_12
with
the
technology_22
technology_9
component_8
and
be
one
of
the
most
popular
open
component_14
real

connector_data_1
connector_1
technology_1
one
of
the
previous
version
of
technology_9
connector_1
connector_10
connector_1
component_20
with
the
help
of
a
micro
pattern_4
component_20
however
the
connector_1
technology_26
face
certain
requirement_15
challenge
despite
the
fast
connector_11
of
pattern_4
so
the
technology_9
open
component_14
which
be
constantly
expand
contribute
a
reimplementation
of
technology_9
connector_6
the
reimplementation
have
be
helpful
in
improve
the
requirement_15
and
lower
quality_attribute_17
technology_9
connector_1
support
technology_24
technology_5
and
technology_41
programming
technology_42
and
provide
connector_12
to
different
component_23
of
technology_22
technology_9
furthermore
technology_9
connector_1
also
provide
exceptional
support
for
merge
connector_1
connector_data_1
and
historical
connector_data_1
technology_22
flink
the
final
entrant
among
the
top
real

connector_data_1
connector_1
technology_1
be
technology_22
flink
you
can
think
of
it
a
a
hybrid
of
technology_35
and
technology_9
even
if
technology_9
provide
a
pattern_4
technology_26
it
do
not
have
any
support
for
real
time
connector_1
technology_9
connector_6
flink
overcome
such
issue
by
provide
technology_26
for
pattern_4
component_20
a
a
connector_data_3
flink
can
depict
lower
quality_attribute_17
while
also
exhibit
the
connector_data_1
fault
