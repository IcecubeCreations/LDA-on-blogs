the

ask
“what

the

”
over
half
of
the
respondent
indicate
that
“existing

and
ot

be
their
greatest
challenge
in
this
modern

of

the

in

it
and
ot

how
can
this
be
let’s
examine
and
attempt
to
answer
this
question
by
review
some
key
question
we
commonly
connector_6
from
industrial
organization
a
they
work
on
their
connector_data_1
foundation
component_8
“how
do
one
connector_7
to
and
connector_8
a
decade
of
historical
connector_data_1
from
a
million
tag
plus
requirement_8
component_1
historian
into
a
corporate
connector_data_1
lake
without
disrupt
our
requirement_11
or
the
historian
itself
in
l4
we’ve
attempt
this
and
take
down
our
historian
a
well
a
important
requirement_11
segment
in
the
component_1
”
“how
do
we
securely
connector_9
multiple
connector_data_1
component_9
in
our
l2
and
l3
requirement_11
and
connector_8
it
through
a
single
technology_4
connector_10
and
multiple
firewall
to
our
requirement_8
requirement_5
”
“how
do
we
consolidate
traditional
tag
base
component_1
connector_data_1
alarm
and

dc
meta
connector_data_1
requirement_12
laboratory
connector_data_1
and
other
relational
connector_data_1
component_9
in
a
single
ot
pattern_3
we
want
to
organize
and
connector_data_3
our
ot
connector_data_1
before
connector_11
it
into
the
requirement_8
it
requirement_5
”
“if
we
temporarily
lose
a
connector_10
to
any
ot
connector_data_1
component_10
how
can
we
buffer
the
connector_data_1
so
it
can
be
connector_12
late
ensure
we
don’t
have
incomplete
connector_data_1
set
component_11
our
connector_data_1
science
team
quality_attribute_10
on
the
quality
and
completeness
of
the
connector_data_1
set
they
work
with
”
the
first
question
speak
to
the
importance
of
historical
time
series
connector_data_1
that
be
capture
from
the
industrial
to
the
digital
initiative
underway
in
these
organization
traditionally
real
time
connector_10
be
make
to
the
component_10
component_5
such
a
the
plant
control
component_3

opc
and
the
connector_data_1
be
component_11
in
component_12
time

connector_data_1
connector_13
osi
pi
today
however
organization
want
to
take
advantage
of
modern
quality_attribute_6
requirement_5
computing
component_6
connector_data_4
connector_data_1
connector_13
and
the
wide
variety
of
connector_data_1
requirement_2
visualization
and
analytic
component_13
and
toolsets
these
component_5
afford
at
an
unprecedented
rate
requirement_7
be
look
to
transport
very
large
industrial
connector_data_1
set
into
ot
or
requirement_8
it
connector_data_1
lake
architecture
to
more
fully
exploit
it
these
objective
be
challenge
for
a
number
of
reason
traditional
component_1
historian
be
originally
develop
decade
ago
a
monolithic
pattern_4
architecture
long
before
connector_data_4
component_14
and
micro
component_15
base
architecture
be
conceive
back
then
though
desire
by
many
the
connector_data_5
technology_1
simply
do
not
exist
to
transport
year
of
history
from
these
component_5
into
external
computing
component_16
to
be
combine
with
other
connector_data_1
component_9
and
organize
and
contextualized
in
a
variety
of
connector_data_4
connector_data_1
component_7
so
today
how
you
make
the
connector_10
to
these
component_5
and
how
you
manage
the
quality_attribute_11
requirement_11
and
computing
resource
these
component_5
reside
on
be
critical
a
serious
consequence
of
transport
large

connector_data_1
without
effectively
manage
the
connector_14
at
the
edge
have
be
to
disrupt
production
level
component_5
or
requirement_11
also
noteworthy
be
that
these
component_5
reside
at
the

typically
one

and
how
the

during
the
transport
of

critical
in
successfully
land

the

it

typically
organization
want
to
connector_7
to
several
of
these
connector_data_1
component_9
at
each
location
and
coordinate
the
transport
of
all
connector_data_1
through

in

opening
multiple

multiple

on

and
in
some
organization
would
violate
it
ot

and
cybersecurity
requirement_13
logically
it
and
ot
organization
want
a

port
open
in

a

to
minimize

vulnerability
transport
connector_data_1
from

be

provide
the

to

around

in

organization
critical
plant

component_5
be
purposely
place
behind

to
protect
them
from

or
attack
quality_attribute_12
edge
appliance
and
connector_data_1
diode
have
emerge
to
connector_15
this
issue
on
a
point
solution
basis
but
become
challenge
when
organization
want
to
quality_attribute_1
the
collection
of
ot
connector_data_1
across
their
requirement_8
what
be
more
desirable
be
to
combine
several
all
operational
connector_data_1
component_9
from
a

and
transport
it
a
a

and
pattern_5
connector_8
across

boundary
and
finally
to
the
requirement_5
load
balance
be
a
major
consideration
a
this
must
be
accomplish
quality_attribute_14
at
quality_attribute_1
without
disruption
to
the
requirement_11
or

level
connector_data_1
component_5
that
be
connector_7
hopefully
it
be
clear
that
the
‘digital

require
in
these
requirement_8
connector_data_1
foundation
project
for
component_1
requirement_1
requirement_7
be
not
a
trivial
matter
question

again
speak
to
the
variety
of
ot
connector_data_1
component_9
and
connector_data_6
which
must
be
deal
with
from
operational
environment
fortunately
today
modern
component_14
technology_1
be
infinitely
more
capable
than
the
quality_attribute_7
time
series
or
relational
connector_data_1
connector_13
of
decade
past
today’s
component_14
technology_1
be
now
capable
of
connector_19
any
connector_data_1
type
in
a

pattern_3
and
if
quality_attribute_15
properly
for
all
intent
and
purpose
they
can
quality_attribute_1
infinitely
quality_attribute_16
and
quality_attribute_17
be
some
of
the
driver
for
organization
move
to
requirement_14
environment
once
consolidate
in
a

component_11
ot

can
be
organize

previously
not

connector_data_4
connector_data_1

requirement_7
a

engineer

utilize

they

that

this

it
be

for

component_13
to
be

and
to
be
able
to
‘buffer’

so
it
can
be
connector_12
once
the
connector_10

this
capability
be
common
in
ot
manage
connector_data_1
component_3
but
historically
le
so
in

manage
component_5

be
refer

connector_12
saf
requirement_15
saf
ensure

this
be
relevant
a
not
all
connector_3
solution
be
develop

type
of

and
can
be
critical
for
downstream
connector_data_1

in

the

several

of

we
be

that
component_12
ot

and
the
requirement_11
they
reside
on
be
not
design
for
the

of

we
now
live
in
they
can
easily
be
disrupt

effectively
manage
a
large

of

and
connector_22
this
be
connector_20
in
the
current

a

adapt
their

to
these

however
this
be
a

that

it
quality_attribute_13

can
also
