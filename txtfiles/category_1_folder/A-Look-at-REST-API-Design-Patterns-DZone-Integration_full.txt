about
useful

intuitive
design
pattern_2
in

component_1
architecture
in
general
design
pattern_2
be
formalize
best
practice
that
a
programmer
can
use
to
solve
common
problem
when
design
an
component_3
or
component_4
below
be
different
element
of
design
pattern_2
for
a
pattern_1
architecture
pattern_1

there
be
design
rule
that
be
apply
to
establish
the
different
characteristic
of
the
pattern_1
architectural
style
which
be
refer
to
a
pattern_1
constraint
pattern_5
statelessness
cacheable
uniform
pattern_6
component_5
goal
of
pattern_7
component_1
design
restful
component_6
should
be
straightforward
unambiguous
easy
to
connector_3
well
pattern_8
and
most
importantly
quality_attribute_2
with
well

and
standardize

component_1
design
goal

affordance
affordance
be
the
possibility
of
an
action
on
an
connector_data_1
or
environment
an
component_1
with
clear
perceive
affordance
allow
the
developer
to
understand
it
purpose
and
to
use
it
seamlessly
inside
the
cybernetic
environment
it
be
design
for

loosely
couple
in
restful
apis
multiple
component_7
be
connector_4
to
the
same
backend
component_8
so
when
the
internal
representation
of
a
component_8
be
connector_5
it
should
not
affect
component_1
consumption
at
the
component_9
side
in
a
loosely
couple
design
component_6
be
independent
and
modification
in
one
win
t
impact
the
of
component_10
within
an
technology_3
the

modify
or
replace
however
the
loose

approach
offer
component_7
quality_attribute_3
quality_attribute_4
and

while

requirement_7
across

to
maximize

web
architecture
pattern_7
component_6
should
use
technology_2
a
a
transport
pattern_6
since
the
infrastructure
component_8
and
component_9
technology_4
for
technology_2
be
widely
quality_attribute_7
already
pattern_7
component_6
should
take
advantage
of
technology_2

or
verb
such
a
connector_2
put
and
coding_keyword_1
pattern_7
component_1
design
pattern_2
component_1
design
pattern_2
provide
a
description
or
template
to
solve
specific
recur
component_1
design
problem
that
any
architect
and
component_1
designer
would
to
adopt
in
their
component_1
design

statelessness
connector_6
between
component_9
and
component_8
should
be
stateless
which
mean
that
every
component_9
connector_data_2
contain
all
the
connector_data_3
necessary
for
the
component_8
to
component_13
the
connector_data_2
so
there
be
no
global
state
thereby
reduce
the
complexity
of
the
component_8
the
quality_attribute_3
news
be
that
some
restful
web
technology_5
provide
an
out
of
the
component_14
implementation
for
statelessness
for
example
technology_6

content
negotiation
content
negotiation
be
a
mechanism
or
component_13
that
component_15
and
component_7
can
select
a
their
resource
representation
technology_7
for
their
connector_6
and
handshake
during
their
usual

connector_6
technology_2
specification
come
up
with
a
set
of
technology_8
coding_keyword_2
through
which
the
component_9
can
connector_2
connector_data_3
about
a
connector_data_2
resource
and
carry
the
connector_data_4
that
indicate
it
representation
so
for
content
negotiation
pattern_1
component_15
need
to
use
technology_2
coding_keyword_2
that
be
when
the
component_9
make
connector_data_2
it
include
the
connector_7
coding_keyword_2
the

of

that
the

can

with
no
additional
step
to
the
component_9
connector_data_2
the
component_8
component_13

it

a
