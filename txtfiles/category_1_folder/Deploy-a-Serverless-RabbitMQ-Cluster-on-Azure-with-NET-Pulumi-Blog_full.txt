now
that

create

it
be
time
to
put
it
all
together
inside

empty
technology_17
we
create
early
note
that
we
be
use
two
loop
to
create
the

the
first
one
create
most
of
the
resource
storage
firewall
requirement_6
container
etc
and
the
second
one
create

a
component_12
of
the
technology_4
the
second
loop
combine
with
the
custom
container
startup
command
help
u
ensure
that
the
technology_4
will
start
without
fail
only
when
the
entire
infrastructure
be
ready
this
workaround
be
require
because
at
the
connector_6
of
the

technology_2
container
instance
do
not
allow
manual
allocation
of
private
ip
connector_20
and
because
rabibtmqâs
discovery
component_13
require
those
ip
which
be
quality_attribute_6
only
after
the
container
be
create
we
end
up
in
a
chicken
and
the
egg
situation
to
overcome
that
we
need
to
allow
the
container
to
start
but
delay
the
connector_21
of
rabbitmqâs
startup
script
without
pattern_4
the
container
and
use
to
our
advantage
the
fact
that
technology_1
doesnât
start
when
it
canât
resolve
it
own
hostname
that
be
why
we
create
those
dns
component_12
last
quality_attribute_1
the
stackonce
the
script
be
complete
we
can
connector_data_2
pulumi
up
yes
to
quality_attribute_1
it
where
the
yes
argument
skip
the
question
whether
to
quality_attribute_1
or
not
once
pulumi
have
build
the
deployment
component_16
and
discover
all
the
resource
remember
that
you
need
to
connector_data_2
technology_2
cli
to
login
to
your
subscription
so
that
pulumi
can
connector_22
the
deployment
you
can
connector_data_2
az
login
to
login
to
the
technology_2
portal
in
an
interactive
manner
connector_23
the
clusterchecking
the
clusterto
connector_24
that
all
technology_4
have
manage
to
join
the
cluster
we
will
connector_5
to
one
of
the
technology_4
use
az
container
exec
to
connector_25
a
shell
from
within
that
container
see
more
on
the
exec
command
here
once
the
shell
be
connector_5
you
can
connector_data_2
rabbitmqctl
cluster_status
and
you
should
see
all
three
technology_4
in
the

connector_data_3
conclusionthe
example
in
this
can
be
use
a
a
base
for
a
complete
solution
which
include
additional
container
and
manage
component_17
provide
by
technology_2
also
the
for
quality_attribute_1
the
example
in
a
real
world
scenario
would
be
quality_attribute_7
split

small
