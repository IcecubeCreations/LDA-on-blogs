three

a

with

of

prospect
to
understand
how

lie
a
treasure

of
requirement_9
that
it
team
realize
a
part
of
a
typical

while
this
be
not
an
exhaustive
connector_data_2
let’s
take
a
quick
look
at
some
of
the
more
common
benefit
our
requirement_1
connector_data_3
out
quality_attribute_1
of
pipeline
development
one
of
the
advantage
of
streamsets
connector_data_1
collector
be
accelerate
the
pace
of
development
for
connector_data_1
flow
pipeline
requirement_10
technology_1
while
advantageous
for
their
connector_data_1
component_2
and
requirement_4
capability
be
inherently
complex
and
regularly
require
a
lot
of
custom
and
script
developer
have
become
increasingly
sophisticate
in
their
ability
to
utilize
these
technology_2
however
the
component_2
for
build
pipeline
be
still
draw
out
and
the
component_2
to
go
from
development
to
test
to
production
be
overly
complicate
streamsets
be
specifically
design
to
solve
for
this
enabling
team
to
continue
to
use
lead
technology_2
but
design
ingestion
dataflows
that
move
connector_data_1
across
their
architecture
via
a
drag
and
drop
that
remove
a
great
deal
of
the
complexity
a
a
connector_data_4
team
can
vastly
reduce
the
amount
of
time
require
to
go
build
test
and
quality_attribute_2
complex
component_3
time
to
connector_5
connector_data_1
but
this
isn’t
about
connector_6
money
many
requirement_1
cite
time
to
connector_5
connector_data_1
to
stakeholder
a
a
key
trouble
spot
that
impede
requirement_11
agility
streamsets
provide
this
acceleration
a
a
by
technology_3
of
improve
development
quality_attribute_1
mention
above
but
also
by
enabling
requirement_1
to
blend
pattern_2
and
connector_7
workload
opening
up
possibility
for
how
connector_data_1
be
serve
up
across
an
organization
in
addition
to
support
pattern_2
component_4
streamsets
quality_attribute_3
directly
with
lead
connector_7
technology_1
such
a
technology_4
kafka™
enabling
component_5
to
connector_7
workload
alongside
pattern_2
orient
one
it
also
quality_attribute_3
with
connector_data_1
component_2
technology_1
such
a
technology_4
spark™
you
can
even
component_2
custom
technology_5
within
streamsets
pipeline
provide
quality_attribute_4
requirement_12
for
connector_data_1
component_2
and
connector_7
workload
the
real
world
example
be
impressive
we
have
dozen
of
requirement_1
across
requirement_13
who
be
gain
tremendous
requirement_9
through
streamsets
here
be
a

reduce
the
cost
per

down
to
a
mere
$135
connector_data_4
in
an
aggregate
connector_8
to
their
requirement_11
of
$1
4m
usd
another
fortune

requirement_1
who
come
on
board
a
year
ago
be
currently
ingest
over


component_6
into
their
connector_data_1
lake
and
will
pass
a
million
soon
they
have
do
this
with
one
connector_data_1
engineer
a
requirement_1
in
the
automotive
requirement_13
have
a
backlog
of

connector_data_1
ingestion
from
their
dozen
of
requirement_11
unit
some
of
which
have
be
connector_data_5
month
in
the
past
in
a
single
month
after
they
quality_attribute_2
streamsets
they
drain
the
entire
backlog
and
now
have
automate
the
component_2
now
so
that
a
connector_data_1
component_4
can
turn
into
a
technology_7
query
able
within
hour
lastly
a
financial
component_7
firm
note
a
reduction
in

to
connector_5
connector_data_1
to
analyst
from


day
down
to

hour
a
a
connector_data_4
of
streamsets
reduce
dependence
on
specialize
skill
beyond
the
immediate
productivity
benefit
i’ve
hear
about
from
requirement_1
there
be
a
strategic
advantage
to
move
from
custom
cod
to
a
component_8
sdc
that
be
reduce
the
need
for
specialize
skill
or
say
differently
quality_attribute_4
utilize
those
precious
skill
set
streamsets
enable
requirement_1
to
staff
their
ingestion
project
more
economically
without
have
to
rely
on
scarce
and
or
costly
resource
indeed
put
the
cost
for
a
skilled
technology_4
kafka™
developer
at
nearly
$120

year
usd
and
an
technology_8
developer
average
roughly
$90

year
while
these
skill
be
not
entirely
the
same
by
enabling
the
requirement_1
to
blend
them
team
can
rework
the
overall
economics
of
connector_data_1
engineering
and
connector_data_1
ingestion
a
a
final
example
a
requirement_14
requirement_4
and
connector_data_1
firm
plan
to
reduce
member
of
their
team
dedicate
to
ingestion
from

highly
skilled
technology_9
developer
to
a
team
of

utilize
a
blend
of
technology_8
and
technology_9
skill
this
will
greatly
reduce
their
cost
on
connector_data_1
ingestion
and
requirement_3
and
allow
those
skilled
people
to
focus
on
high
requirement_9
work
this
be
a
short
connector_data_2
of
the
benefit
that
can
be
glean
by
modernize
connector_data_1
ingestion
a
deployment
quality_attribute_5
naturally
the
challenge
and
benefit
grow
proportionally
