this

by
opensource

to
start
with
a
confession
i
requirement_1
a
lot
i
ve
always
be
fascinate
by
find
and
interest
way
to
bring
mean
to
connector_data_1
with
interactive
visualization
technology_1
while
i
m
definitely
a
geek
for
number
the
human
mind
be
simply
much
quality_attribute_1
at
interpret
trend
visually
than
it
be
pick
them
out
a
spreadsheet
and
even
when
your
interest
in
a
dataset
be
the
raw
number
themselves
a
requirement_1
can
help
to
bring
mean
by
highlight
which
requirement_6
matter
most
and
what
the
component_4
of
those
number
be
figure
out
how
to
best
visualize
your
connector_data_1
can
be
challenge
maybe
you
start
out
by
create
a
few
graph
in
a
spreadsheet
and
be
try
to
find
a
way
to
tie
them
all
together
or
maybe
you
re
work
with
an
exist
requirement_7
technology_1
and
want
to
find
a
way
to
make
your
connector_data_1
more
quality_attribute_2
to
a
wide
audience
or
perhaps
you
ve
go
several
real
time
component_5
and
be
try
to
find
a
way
to
tie
them
all
together
fortunately
there
be
a
number
of
great
open_source
requirement_1
technology_1
out
there
that
make
the
much
easy
on
one
end
of
the
spectrum
be
open_source
requirement_8
intelligence
technology_1
technology_16
or
technology_17
but
for
a
small
project
technology_1
these
could
be
overkill
and
in
some
requirement_9
you
might
be
able
to
find
a
requirement_1
technology_1
that
be
already
design
to
work
with
the
kind
of
connector_data_1
you
be
deal
with
here
s
a
look
at
a
few
open_source
requirement_1
technology_1
that
you
might
consider
freeboard
freeboard
be
a
requirement_1
technology_1
design
with
quality_attribute_3
and
ease
of
use
at
top
of
the
mind
it
s
technology_5
component_6
be
drag
and
drop
capable
and
connector_data_1
component_5
can
be
with
no
programming
experience
design
for
iot
u
it
can
easily
be
use
to
create
attractive
requirement_1
for
nearly
any
purpose
and
be
a
great
choice
if
you
re
start
out
with
create
requirement_1
and
want
to
connector_4
start
quickly
the
project
also
offer
free
and
pay

allow
you
to

which
be

in
a
number
of
way
it
support
a
variety
of
different
visualization
technology_1
and

out
of
the

and
can

stashbord
stashboard
be
a
slightly
different
kind
of
requirement_1
than
some
of
the
others
we
look
at
it
be
design
to
provide
you
with
connector_data_2
about
requirement_3
component_14
and
apis
for
those
quickly
want
to
whether

down

for
their

component_15
component_16
stashboard
can
be
apply
to
pretty
much
any
type
of
component_15
and
be
design
to
be
run
easily
a
an
independent
component_16
so
that
it
can
display
the
status
of
your
project

these
be
far
from
the
only
option
there
be
many
others
to
choose
from
and
there
be
many
connector_data_1
visualization
technology_14

templating

out
there
that
might
help
you
roll
your
