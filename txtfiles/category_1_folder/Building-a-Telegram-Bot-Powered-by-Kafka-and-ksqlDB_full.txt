2020imagine
you’ve
connector_4
a
connector_1
of
connector_data_1
it’s
not
“big_data
”
but
it’s
certainly
a
lot
within
the
connector_data_1
you’ve
connector_4
some
bit
you’re
interest
in
and
of
those
bit
you’d
to
be
able
to
query
connector_data_2
about
them
at
any
point
sound
fun
right
since
i
say
“stream
of
data”—and
you’re
connector_5
this
on
a
about
technology_5
kafka®—you’re
probably
think
about
technology_1
and
then
because
i
mention
“querying
”
i’d
hazard
a
guess
that
you’ve
connector_4
in
mind
an
additional
component_4
of
some
sort
whether
relational
or
technology_6
but
what
if
you
didn’t
need
any
component_4
other
than
technology_1
itself
what
if
you
could
ingest
pattern_3
enrich
aggregate
and
query
connector_data_1
with
technology_1
with
technology_3
we
can
do
this
and
i
want
to
show
you
exactly
how
we’re
go
to
build
a
quality_attribute_2
component_5
that
capture
wi
fi
packet
component_6
them
and
serve
up
on
demand
connector_data_2
about
the
component_7
connector_6
to
wi
fi
the
“secret
sauce”
here
be
ksqldb’s
ability
to
build
stateful
aggregate
that
can
be
directly
connector_7
use
connector_8
query
this
be
go
to
power
a
very
quality_attribute_2
requirement_1
for
the
pattern_4
component_2
telegram
which
take
a
unique
component_8
name
a
input
and
coding_keyword_1
statistic
about
it
wi
fi
probe
activity
to
the
component_9
the
overall
architecture
look
this
turn
a
connector_1
into
state
the
connector_data_1
come
from
wireshark
and
be
connector_1
to
technology_1
provide
by
confluent
requirement_2
the
raw
technology_1
topic
look
this
first
we
declare
a
schema
on
it
in
technology_3
with
a
connector_1
create

coding_keyword_2
with

=
pcap
value_format=
technology_7
pattern_5
=
pattern_5
from
this
we
can
materialise
state
to
answer
question
such
a
how
many
wi
fi
probe
have
there
be
for
each
component_8
when
be
the
first
probe
when
be
the
last
probe
since
we’re
deal
with
state
“what’s
the
requirement_8
for
this
key
”
and
not
a
connector_1
an
unbounded
series
of
requirement_8
which
or
not
have
a

this
be
a
component_10
connector_data_3

pretty
neat
right
take
a
brief
peek
under
the
cover
so
what’s
go
on
here
it
turn
out
that
technology_1
be
not
a
pretty
face
nor
be
it
a
highly
quality_attribute_3
connector_data_4
pattern_6
it’s
also
a
component_2
with
component_11
for
requirement_9
technology_1
connector_6
and
connector_1
component_12
technology_1
connector_1
combine
with
technology_3
we
can
connector_9
technology_8
statement
to
take
a
technology_1
topic
and
apply
connector_1
component_12
technique
to
it
such
a
pattern_3
row
predicate
pattern_3
column
projection
schema
manipulation
join
to
other
topic
aggregation
type
conversion
but
where’s
it
all
component_13
normally
we’d
be
off
to
a
technology_6
component_13
or
technology_9
to
connector_9
this
connector_data_1
out
before
an
component_14
can
query
it
turn
out
technology_1
be
a
great
place
to
component_13
connector_data_1
particularly
with
recent
development
in
tiered
storage
for
connector_data_1
in
technology_1
technology_1
be
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_3
and
fault
tolerant
and
technology_3
us
it
a
the
persistent
component_13
for
any
component_15
or
connector_1
that
be
populate
within
it
technology_3
also
us
rocksdb
to
build
a
local
materialise
pattern_7
of
the
connector_data_1
hold
in
the
component_15
and
aggressively
pattern_8
this
in
memory
technology_3
be
also
a
quality_attribute_4
component_5
and
can
run
cluster
across
multiple
nodes—and
rocksdb
will
do
the
same
in
a
rather
clever
design
technology_3
maintain
a
changelog
for
rocksdb
in
a
technology_1
topic
a
well—so
if
a
technology_10
be
lose
it
state
can
be
rebuild
directly
from
technology_1
thus
technology_1
be
our
primary
and
only
component_5
of
component_16
that
we
need
in
this
scenario
technology_3
support
the
ability
to
query
a
state
component_13
in
rocksdb
directly
and
that’s
what
we
saw
above
in
the
select
that
we
run
if
you’re
familiar
with
technology_1
connector_3
on
which
technology_3
be
build
then
you’ll
recognise
this
requirement_10
a
interactive
query
query
state
from
a
technology_1
connector_1
be
insanely
useful
there
be
an
aphorism
in
the
connector_1
component_12
world
life
be
a
connector_1
of
put
into
more
concrete
term
most
of
what
happen
around
u
and
in
the
requirement_7
for
which
we’re
build
component_17
usually
originate
a
an

something
happen
these
“things”
well
connector_4
pattern_9
up
a
part
of
the
implementation
detail
of
how
they
be
component_13
and
component_12
but
fundamentally
they
occur
a
an
unbounded
never
ending
series
of
thing
it
make
a
lot
of
sense
then
to
consider
build
a
component_5
around
this
component_18
of
because
it
give
u
the
low
quality_attribute_5
and
semantic
component_19
that
we
need
when
deal
with
this
connector_data_1
put
another
way
be
the
low
granularity
of
most
connector_data_1
that
we
work
with
in
our
component_5
and
a
you
can’t
go
back
from
a
low
quality_attribute_6
replica
to
the
original
the
same
happen
with
our
connector_data_1
a
soon
a
we
roll
it
up
and
component_13
it
a
a
lump
of
state
in
a
component_20
we
lose
all
the
benefit
of
the
underneath
those
benefit
include
pattern_1
component_21
and
the
analysis
of
behaviour
within
a
connector_1
of

if
we
agree
that
first
capture
the
connector_10
that
happen
around
u
a
a
connector_1
of
be
a
quality_attribute_7
idea
then
we
need
to
think
about
how
we
build
component_17
around
this
at
one
end
of
the
quality_attribute_1
we
have
the
classic
kind
of
hoc
requirement_11
and
coding_keyword_3
report
that
be
invariably
go
to
be
drive
from
connector_data_1
in
a
component_13
such
a
technology_11

or
a
suitable
technology_9
technology_1
can
connector_1
into
these
component_17
with
technology_1
connector_6
so
there’s
no
problem
there
at
the
other
end
of
the
quality_attribute_1
we
have
component_21
that
be
go
to
be
drive
by
these

and
subscribe
to
technology_1
topic
be
the
perfect
way
to
do
that
but
what
about
component_21
that
aren’t
drive
and
aren’t
analytics—those
in
between
that
still
need
to
work
with
the
connector_data_1
that
we
have
from
the
original

but
that
need
this
connector_data_1
materialise
a
state
instead
of
an
pattern_1
component_14
that
simply
respond
when
an
order
be
place
we
want
another
component_14
to
be
able
to
look
at
“how
many
order
have
be
place
for
a
give
customer”
or
“what
be
the
total
sale
of
a
give
item
in
the
last
hour
”
we
can
build
this
use
technology_1
and
technology_3
technology_3
allow
you
to
define
materialise
pattern_7
on
top
of
a
connector_1
of
connector_data_1
which
be
quality_attribute_8
to
query
at
low
quality_attribute_5
technology_3
us
technology_8
to
declare
these
and
once
the
pattern_7
be
declare
any
component_14
can
use
the
pattern_10
component_22
to
query
it
build
a
telegram
requirement_1
with
technology_1
and
technology_3
telegram
be
a
pattern_4
component_2
similar
in
concept
to
whatsapp
messenger
and
so
on
it
have
a
nice
requirement_1
technology_12
which
we’re
go
to
use
here
i’ve
draw
heavily
on
this
for
the
foundation
of
this
requirement_1
it’s
💯
a
proof
of
concept
so
do
take
it
with
a
pinch
of
salt
whilst
i’m
use
telegram
for
this

this
same
approach
would
work
fine
with
a
requirement_1
on
your
own
component_2
of
choice
slack
etc
or
within
your
own
standalone
component_14
that
want
to
look
up
state
that’s
be
populate
and
maintain
from
a
connector_1
of
in
technology_1
you
first
need
to
set
up
a
telegram
requirement_1
which
i
cover
in
detail
already
in
this
coding_keyword_4
once
you’ve
set
up
the
telegram
requirement_1
you
need
to
run
your

which
be
go
to
provide
the
automation
we’re
build
a
very
quality_attribute_2
example—someone
connector_11
a
component_8
name
to
the
requirement_1
in
telegram
and
it
connector_data_5
with
the
various
statistic
about
the
component_8
to
enable
the
bot’s
to
connector_12
these
connector_data_4
we’ll
use
the
webhook
technology_12
which
connector_13
the
connector_data_4
to
our
local

since
this
be
all
run
on
a
laptop
at
home
we
need
to
be
able
to
listen
for
the
inbound
connector_14
and
an
easy
way
to
do
that
be
with
ngrok
set
up
an
account
download
the
small
executable
and
configure
it
with
the
auth
connector_data_6
you
connector_12
when
you
sign
up
and
then
run
it
for
port

ngrok
authtoken
xxxxyyyy
ngrok

this
give
you
a
temporary
coding_keyword_5
url
that
will

the
final
piece
to
the
puzzle
be
the

which
be
go

the

connector_18
to
the

requirement_1
and
do
something
with
it
you
can
find

the

note
this

the
above
fell
out
of
the
ugly
tree
and
hit
every
branch
on
the
way
down
for
sure
but
hey
it
work
😉
now
we
can
connector_19
a
connector_data_4
to
our
telegram
requirement_1
and
connector_4
a
connector_data_7
base
on
a
direct
pattern_11
of
state
from
technology_3
enrich
connector_3
of
connector_data_1
with
pattern_11
what
we’ve
build
so
far
be
already
rather
useful
we’ve
simplify
our
architecture
and
we’re
about
to
do
so
again
because
what
connector_data_1
truly
life
in
isolation
in
this
world
much
of
the
connector_data_1
that
we
pass
around
be
normalise
to
an
extent
and
thus
when
it
come
to
present
it
back
to
a
human
be
it
benefit
from
a
degree
of
denormalisation
we
don’t
have
to
go
the
whole
hog
but
quality_attribute_2
touch
resolve
a
mac
connector_20
to
a
component_8
name
be
pretty
handy
so
let’s
do
that
here
the
component_1
of
our
pattern_11
connector_data_1
be
technology_16
and
instead
of
connector_21
out
to
it
each
time
we
replicate
it
a
a
local
pattern_8
within
technology_1
and
technology_3
create
component_1
connector
source_mongodb_01
with
connector

=
io
debezium
connector
technology_16
mongodbconnector
technology_16
component_26
=
rs0
technology_16

technology_16
name
=
unifi
collection
whitelist
=
ace
component_8
ace
component_9
now
we
have
a
snapshot
of
everything
in
the
specify
technology_16
collection
a
well
a
every
subsequent
connector_22
to
the
connector_data_1
in
technology_16
the
connector_data_1
that
we
connector_4
from
technology_16
be
the
raw
technology_7
so
we
first
treat
it
a
a
connector_1
because
we
want
to
component_12
each
connector_data_4
that
come
through
a
it
own

in
order
to

if

about

arrive
on

here’s
a
quality_attribute_2
example
in
which
we
use

again
to
deserialise

project
the

from

the

where
the

run

and
connector_data_14
be

to
the

because
technology_1
topic
be
unbounded
so
be
connector_13
queries—they
will
run
forever
until
you
terminate
the
query
and
thus
your

can
set
up
a

to

any

show
you
how

we’ll

a

of

that
we’re
interest
in

but
the
concept
could
also
be
easily
apply
to

that
you’re

anything
conditional
really
remember
those
component_10
connector_data_16
that
we
talk
about

that
provide
key
requirement_8

we
use
these
for

and
also
for

resolution
we’re
go
to
also
use
a

here
to
