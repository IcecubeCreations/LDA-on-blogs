first
realize

when
they
the

this

can
work

requirement_8
often
find
themselves
need
more
—
more

more

more

the
next
option
be

we

dive

—
and
then
finish
up
with

at

overview
incumbent
technology_1
technology_2
make
up
the

—
and
that
stand
to
reason
they
ve
be
around
the
long
and
many
be
design

so
the

substantial
some
of
these
technology_2
consist
of

because

the

be
well

the
quickly
this

be
crucial
a
lose
connector_data_1
can
be
a
huge
issue
in

where
you
have
for
example
surpass
your

hour
allotment

where
the

about

they
