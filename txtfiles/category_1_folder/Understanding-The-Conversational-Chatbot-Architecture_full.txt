understand

architecture
requirement_1
architecture
be
the
heart
of
requirement_1
development
base
on
the
quality_attribute_1
and
component_3
of
requirement_5
the
architecture
involve
in
build
a
requirement_1
connector_2
dramatically
so
base
on
component_4
requirement
we
need
to
alter
different
element
but
the
basic
connector_3
flow
remain
the
same
how
to
choose
the
right
requirement_1
architecture
and
various
aspect
of
the

requirement_1
choose
the
right
requirement_1
architecture
choose
the
correct
architecture
quality_attribute_2
on
what
type
of
domain
the
requirement_1
will
have
for
example
you
might
ask
a
requirement_1
something
and
the
requirement_1
connector_data_1
to
that
maybe
in
mid
conversation
you
leave
the
conversation
only
to
pick
the

up
late
base
on
the
type
of
requirement_1
you
choose
to
build
the
requirement_1
or
not
connector_4
the
conversation
history
for
narrow
domain
a
pattern_1
match
architecture
would
be
the
ideal
choice
however
for
chatbots
that
deal
with
multiple
domain
or
multiple
component_5
broad

in
these
requirement_6
sophisticate
state
of
the
art
neural
requirement_7
architecture
such
a
long
short
term
memory
lstms
and
reinforcement
agent
be
your
best
bet
due
to
the

of

the

nlp
component_12
be

component_8
that
interpret

say
at
any

and
convert
the

to
pattern_2
input
that
component_7
can
further
component_11
since
the
requirement_1
be

specific
it
must
support
so
many

nlp

contain

nlp
component_12
to
choose
agent
for
dialogue
requirement_10
it
manage
the
actual

of
the

for
example
the
component_16
might
say
“he
need
to
order
ice
cream”
and
the
requirement_9
might
take
the
order
then
the
component_16
might
say
“change
it
to
coffee”
here
the
component_16
refer
to
the
order
he
have
place
early
the
requirement_9
must
correctly
interpret
this
and
make
connector_2
to
the
order
he
have
place
early
before
confirm
with
the
component_16
dialog
requirement_10
plugin
enable
u
to
do
this
dialogue
requirement_10
further
have
follow
key
plugins
feedback
mechanism
here
the
agent
take
the
feedback
from
component_16
time
to
time
to
if
the
requirement_9
be
do
fine
with
the
conversation
and
the
component_16
be
satisfy
with
the
bot’s
connector_6
this
reinforce
the
requirement_9
to
from

and
correct
itself
in

requirement_11
requirement_11
be

to
take

broadly
it
create
