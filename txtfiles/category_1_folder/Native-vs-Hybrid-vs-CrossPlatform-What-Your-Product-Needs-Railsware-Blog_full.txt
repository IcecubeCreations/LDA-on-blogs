you’ll

requirement_2
component_2
budget
time
to
requirement_7
reach
requirement_7
coverage
component_2
requirement_8
ui
and
ux
requirement_9
so
what’s
your
choice
build
a
requirement_1
component_2
build
a
hybrid
component_2
build
a
cross
component_1
component_2
requirement_1
component_2
developmentgoing
requirement_1
be
the
way
most
technology_1
owner
dream
of
but
not
all
can
afford
it
involve
the
creation
of
a
requirement_2
component_2
that
fit
one
component_1
only
in
this
requirement_3
engineer
leverage
a
requirement_1
to
the
operate
component_7
programming
technology_7
it
can
be
technology_8
or
since
recently
technology_9
for
technology_10
and
technology_11
objective
technology_12
for
io
component_8
love
requirement_1
component_9
for
high
requirement_8
and
quality_attribute_2
to
the
component_1
ux
this
approach
though
scar
off
startupers
for
be
cost
connector_2
and
the
cost
be
the
key
distinction
of
requirement_1
vs
hybrid
component_2
development
for
development
engineer
connector_3
connector_4
to
the
device’s
full
feature
set
this
allow
them
to
leverage
advance
requirement_9
memory
requirement_10
complex
requirement_11
etc
but
the
big
challenge
be
to
run
the
component_2
on
two
component_1
to
do
this
you
need
to
make
separate
codebases
yet
some
requirement_1
extension
enable
connector_5
for
example
you
can
connector_5
the
technology_13
technology_14
between
io
and
technology_10
component_9
use
technology_8
requirement_1
even
so
technology_1
owner
be
desperate
to
increase
development
cost
almost
twofold
technology_5
to
use
example
hybrid
component_2
developmentnative
be
not
a
must
for
the
requirement_2
experience
besides
your
project
might
need
another
vector
of
priority
a
fast
time
to
requirement_7
to
this
effect
a
hybrid
component_2
be
not
a
cheap
alternative
it
require
le
time
for
development
and
allow
for
connector_5
the
reverse
side
of
the
coin
be
sluggish
requirement_8
and
suboptimal
requirement_12
theoretically
it
be
possible
to
achieve
a
great
ux
and
navigation
pattern_1
from
a
visual
standpoint
this
be
however
a
challenge
to
put
into
practice
hybrid
component_9
blend
web
element
with
requirement_2
one
so
you
create
a
codebase
use
technology_15
web
technology_4
technology_16
technology_1
technology_17
then
you
wrap
it
inside
a
requirement_1
container
–
the
webview
the
content
within
webview
be
render
a
a
plain
old
it
be
responsible
for
ux
and
connector_4
to
the
hardware
requirement_9
camera
gps
etc
the
latter
however
be
quite
limit
in
component_10
of
hybrid
component_11
development
vs
requirement_1
component_11
development
eventually
a
component_5
can
connector_3
a
standalone
component_11
in
the
component_2
component_12
technology_5
to
use
example
cross
component_1
component_2
developmentit
be
important
to
remember
that
hybrid
and
cross
component_1
component_9
be
not
the
same
perhaps
the
only
common
feature
between
them
be
shareability
due
to
that
they
both
allow
you
to
quality_attribute_3
up
the
pipeline
all
the
rest
disclose
many
difference
between
cross
component_1
vs
hybrid
component_2
development
cross
component_1
dev
approach
u
a
requirement_1
render
component_13
the
codebase
connector_6
in
technology_18
connector_7
to
requirement_1
component_14
via
the
so
connector_data_1
bridge
this
provide
the
close
to
requirement_1
ux
cross
component_1
component_9
be
free
of
component_1
hook
they
offer
seamless
requirement_9
easy
implementation
and
cost
quality_attribute_4
production
yet
do
not
expect
outstanding
requirement_8
customization
be
also
a
pain
since
it
be
limit
to
the
technology_19
you
use
technology_5
to
use
example
progressive
web
component_2
–
a
a
bonus
to
mention
this
requirement_2
development
approach
be
a
relatively
name
in
the
requirement_7
to
some
extent
progressive
web
component_9
or
pwas
resemble
hybrid
one
they’re
base
on
web
technology_4
and
run
in
a
browser
you
do
not
even
need
to
install
them
yet
you
can
still
connector_4
the
component_2
on
the
home
screen
on
the
other
hand
they
be
progressive
because
the
ux
be
significantly
optimize
a
pwa
work
offline
provide
gps
connector_4
connector_8
connector_data_2
and
many
more
for
technology_10
for
io
late
release
your
benefit
will
be
constrain
no
camera
connector_4
no
default
launch
image
no
installation
technology_20
and
other
issue
for
development
build
a
progressive
web
component_2
be
a
royal
flush
it
be
cheap
and
fast
than
make
a
cross
component_1
component_2
not
to
say
a
requirement_1
one
pwa
be
also
gainful
from
the
talent
perspective
you
can
go
with
angular
or
technology_6
savvy
engineer
since
there
be
no
dedicate
pwa
technology_19
so
far
e
commerce
component_9

appbudgethow
much
money
you
can

on
a
requirement_2
component_2
be
fundamental
but
it’s
not
the
only
metric
for
choose
a
dev
approach
when
you’re
limit
in
fund
you
can’t
afford
a
requirement_1
component_2
for
both
io
and
technology_10
at
best
you’ll
have
to
focus
on
only
one
component_1
on
the
other
hand
even
if
the
budget
be

size
it’s
not
necessary
to
go
requirement_1
your
project
might
benefit
from
a
cheap
component_2
type
that
will
cover
your
specific
need
for
example
your
current
team
consist
of
technology_18
expert
you
can
take
advantage
of
this
and
build
a
j
base
requirement_2
component_2
with
technology_6
requirement_1
otherwise
you’ll
have
to
spend
time
on
hire
expert
for
two
or
more
component_1
specific
team
time
to
markethow
soon
you
need
an
component_2
be
also
crucial
you
should
bear
in
mind
that
build
a
requirement_1
component_2
be
quite
time
connector_2
from
this
standpoint
hybrid
and
even
pwas
be
undisputed
winner
and
this
option
be
well
target
if
you
want
to
win
a
race
to
requirement_2
requirement_7
over
your
competitor
however
you’ll
have
to
lower
your
expectation
for
requirement_8
and
ux
of
the
component_2
once
your
technology_1
have
be
requirement_7
you
might
consider
quality_attribute_6
it
into
a
requirement_1
component_2
with
time
budget
permit
reach
requirement_7
coverage
for
now
we
have
the
two
large
requirement_7
of
requirement_2
component_9
and
most
technology_1
owner
prefer
to
have
their
component_9
quality_attribute_7
on
both
of
them
in
this
component_10
cross
component_1
or
hybrid
component_2
development
be
a
win
approach
they
you
clear
your
mind
of
additional
load
associate
with
multiple
component_1
you’ve
connector_3
one
team
that
work
on
the
component_2
that
can
run
on
both
io
and
technology_10
with
requirement_1
you’ll
have
more
pain
component_2
performanceairbnb’s
example
can
be
instructive
here
this
requirement_4
be
one
of
the
first
adopter
of
technology_6
requirement_1
they
choose
the
cross
component_1
to
move
fast
a
an
organization
and
to
only
have
to
connector_6
technology_1
once
two
year
late
their
priority
connector_11
airbnb
set
it
sight
on
high
component_2
requirement_8
and
quality_attribute_8
dev
experience
hence
now
they’re
put
all
of
their
effort
into
make
requirement_1
amaze
what
we
can
from
airbnb
be
that
you
can
benefit
from
different
dev
approach
at
a
particular
time
they
be
satisfy
with
technology_6
requirement_1
at
the
outset
of
their
journey
to
requirement_2
however
grow
ambition
and
objective
connector_8
them
to
go
requirement_1
that
be
not
a
mistake
but
a
fruitful
experience
a
for
hybrid
component_2
requirement_8
in
general
here
be
what
zuckerberg
think
the
big
mistake
we’ve
make
a
a
requirement_4
be
bet
on
technology_23
a
oppose
to
nativeperhaps
this
be
one
of
the
inspiration
for
create
technology_6
requirement_1
ui
and
uxaccording
to
statista
the
retention
rate
of
requirement_2
component_2
component_8
be
38%
in
it
mean
that
nearly
one
in
three
people
abandon
requirement_2
component_9
after
the
first
experience
that’s
why
the
impression
your
technology_1
provide
be
crucial
requirement_1
component_9
be
headliner
in
ui
and
ux
component_8
connector_3
quality_attribute_8
scroll
dynamic
animation
and
other
appeal
element
and
these
be
wrap
in
a
performant
technology_1
if
we
compare
cross
component_1
development
vs
requirement_1
development
the
former
lag
behind
but
still
the
ux
you
can
connector_3
with
flutter
or
technology_6
requirement_1
be
much
quality_attribute_8
than
with
any
hybrid
technology_19
we’ve
blogged
about
it
in
technology_24
vs
technology_6
requirement_1
functionalitydo
you
want
your
component_8
to
enjoy
requirement_9
connector_12
to
a
device’s
utility
these
be
the
camera
various
sensor
and
so
on
if
you
do
keep
in
mind
that
hybrid
component_9
cannot
connector_13
them
to
the
full
extent
cross
component_1
component_9
be
le
limit
than
hybrid
still
it’s
possible
to
develop
95%
of
the
component_2
use
technology_6
requirement_1
and
the
remain
5%
with
requirement_1
technology_4
the
requirement_1
connector_14
some
sensor
whenever
you
need
them
to
the
full

the
requirement_1
dev
approach
have
no
restriction
in
this
regard
so
what’s
your
choice
build
a
requirement_1
appnative
dev
approach
be
definitely
a
king
it
provide
you
with
unlimited
area
for
development
the
requirement_1
component_2
be
unlikely
to
frustrate
the
ux
expectation
of
your
component_5
and
your
engineer
will
enjoy
work
at
this
project
but
be
prepare
for
your
dev
team
to
increase
almost
twofold
so
will
the
cost
and
do
not
expect
a
fast
ttm
unless
your
developer
be
superman
build
a
hybrid

a
hybrid
approach
can
attract
with

quality_attribute_3
so
an
ambitious
startup
can
benefit
from
build
a

component_2
a
a
pilot
solution
it
be
the
best
option
if
you
do
not
think
much
of

and
requirement_8
these
factor
however
might
scare
off

component_5

a
cross

appthink
of
cross

a
a
golden
mean
between
the
above
option
it
be
not

cheap
than
requirement_1
the

these
be

honest

perhaps
the
difference
between

be
