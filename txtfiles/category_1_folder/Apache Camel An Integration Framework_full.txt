develop
a
single
component_5
with
the
require
feature
to
meet
a
company’s
demand
be
complex
involve
a
lot
of
customize
to
ensure
the
right
outcome
for
small
component_5
it’s
not
a
cumbersome
but
for
to
large
quality_attribute_1
component_5
it
can
be
challenge
to
develop
and
manage
to
help
with
big
component_5
requirement_8
requirement_1
pattern_2
provide
a
complete
set
of
technology_20
to
quality_attribute_2
exist
component_12

component_5
and
third

vendor
component_5
four
approach
to
component_5
requirement_1
there
be
four
component_5
requirement_1
approach
with
each
approach
connector_1
some
of
the
requirement_1
guideline
quality_attribute_3
than
others
the
four
requirement_1
approach
include
transfer
connector_2
component_4
connector_data_3
and
remote
invocation
here
be
a
brief
explanation
of
each
one
transfer
one
component_5
produce
of
connector_2
connector_data_1
for
others
to
connector_3
and
vice
versa
connector_4
component_4
component_7
can
component_15
the
connector_data_1
they
wish
to
connector_4
in
a
common
component_4
connector_data_3
an
component_5
connector_5
to
a
connector_2
pattern_3
component_13
exchange
connector_data_1
and
invoke
behavior
use
connector_data_3
remote
invocation
an
component_5
connector_6
it
component_16
so
that
they
can
be
invoke
remotely
by
other
component_7
to
run
it
behavior
and
exchange
connector_data_1
in
use
these
approach
there
be
a
few
eminent
requirement_1
technology_3
quality_attribute_4
in
the
requirement_9
for
example
technology_21
requirement_1
technology_1
technology_2
requirement_1
and
technology_22
esb
all
these
technology_3
be
quality_attribute_4
in
the
technology_23
environment
and
offer
a
standardize
domain
specific
technology_24
to
quality_attribute_2
component_5
out
of
them

we
can

we
always
use

we
use
commercial
support
for

by
fuse
component_21
and
can
be
find
here
when
not
to

even
though
fuse
component_21
offer
commercial
support
for

we
don’t
recommend
use
technology_1
technology_2
for
substantial
requirement_1
project
an
esb
mulesoft
technology_44
etc
be
the
right
choice
for
those
type
of
project
although
it
offer
many
feature
such
a
bpm
and
bam
you’ll
still
want
to
use
something
other
than
technology_1
technology_2
if
there
be
a

two
or

technology_29

it

such
a
technology_1
technology_46
io

technology_42
template
conclusion
technology_1
technology_2
be
an
excellent
technology_3
for
quality_attribute_2
component_7
with
different
technology_29
and
technology_43
the
best
part
—
besides
exceptional
support
for
various
technology_29
—
be
that
we
can
always
use
the
same
concept
it
also
have
excellent
error
handle
and
automatic
test
that
make
it
optimal
for
specific
requirement_1
project
a
the
number
of
component_7
and
technology_29
increase
technology_1
technology_2
be
a
quality_attribute_3
option
for
quality_attribute_2
them
we
hope
to
see
technology_1
technology_2
continue
to
develop
and
expand
it
reach
a
an
exceptional
