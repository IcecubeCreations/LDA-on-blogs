be
not
regularly
cover
here
but
be
nonetheless
important
web
relate
technology_5
some
time
ago
i
be
ask
by
one
of
our
requirement_7
to
review
a
selection
of
os
connector_data_1
pattern_1
and
propose
a
couple
of
quality_attribute_2
candidate
the
requirement
be
fairly
quality_attribute_3
behave
well
when
there’s
a
large
backlog
of
connector_data_1
be
able
to
create
a
cluster
and
in
requirement_8
of
the
failure
of
a
technology_6
in
a
cluster
try
to
protect
the
connector_data_2
but
never
block
the
pattern_4
even
though
that
might
imply
connector_data_2
lose
nothing
fancy
regard
component_2
and
topic
requirement_9
i
decide
to
connector_3
my
find
here
before
i
forget…
i
don’t
consider
myself
a
connector_data_1
pattern_1
specialist
and
i
spend
only
about
a
day
or
two
on
each
so
i
have
do
some
big
mistake
configuration
wise
i’ll
take
the
blame
if
something
be
misconfigured
or
not
use
correctly
technology_1
technology_1
be
a
well

and
popular
connector_data_1
pattern_1
and
it
have
many
powerful
feature
the
documentation
on
the
technology_1
be
excellent
and
there
be
many
book
quality_attribute_4
technology_1
be
connector_3
in
technology_7
not
a
widely
use
programming
technology_8
but
well
adapt
to
such
connector_data_3
the
requirement_10
pivotal
develop
and
maintain
technology_1
i
review
version



on
centos

component_3
the
installation
be
easy
i
instal
technology_7
version
r14b
from
epel
and
the
technology_1
rpm
the
only
small
issue
i
have
be
that
the
component_3
be
expect
“127


1″
to
be
resolve
in
etc
component_4
and
the
technology_9
vms
i
use
be
miss
that
easy
to
fix
i
also
instal
and
enable
the
requirement_9
plugin
the
technology_1
configuration
be
set
in
the
technology_1
config
and
it
have
ton
of
adjustable
parameter
i
use
the
default
in
term
of
component_5
technology_10
technology_1
support
a
long
connector_data_4
of
technology_8
and
some
technology_11
technology_12
stomp
be
quality_attribute_4
with
a
plugin
component_2
and
topic
can
be
create
either
by
the
web
or
through
the
component_5
component_6
directly
if
you
have
more
than
one
technology_6
they
can
be
cluster
and
then
component_2
and
topic
can
be
replicate
to
other
component_3
i
create

component_7
connector_3
a
technology_13
component_5
and
start
insert
connector_data_1
i
connector_2
a
publish
rate
of
about
20k
s
use
multiple
component_8
but
i
connector_2
a
few
stall
cause
by
the
vm_memory_high_watermark
from
my
understand
during
those
stall
it
connector_4
to
disk
not
exactly
awesome
give
my
requirement
also
some
part
be
always
keep
in
memory
even
if
a
component_7
be
quality_attribute_5
so
even
though
i
have
plenty
of
disk
space
the
memory
usage
grow
and
eventually
hit
the
vm_memory_high_watermark
set
the
cpu
load
be
pretty
high
during
the
load
between
40%
and
50%
on
an

core
vm
even
though
my
requirement
be
not
meet
i
set
up
a
replicate
component_7
on

technology_6
and
insert
a
few
million
connector_data_5
i
kill
one
of
the
two
technology_6
and
insert
be
even
fast
but
then…i
do
a
mistake
i
restart
the
technology_6
and
ask
for
a
resync
either
i
didn’t
set
it
correctly
or
the
resync
be
poorly
connector_5
but
it
take
forever
to
resync
and
it
be
slow
down
a
it
progress
at
58%
do
it
have
be
run
for
17h
one
component_9
at
100%
my
patience
be
exhaust
so
lot
of
feature
decent
requirement_6
but
behavior
not
quality_attribute_6
with
the
requirement
technology_2
technology_2
have
be
design
originally
by
linkedin
it
be
connector_3
in
technology_4
and
it
be
now
under
the
technology_14
project
umbrella
sometimes
you
look
at
a
technology_5
and
you
say
wow
this
be
really
do
the
way
it
should
be
at
least
i
could
say
that
for
the
purpose
i
have
what
be
so
special
about
technology_2
be
the
architecture
it
connector_6
the
connector_data_6
in
flat
and
component_10
ask
connector_data_6
base
on
an
offset
think
of
it
a
technology_15
component_3
component_11
connector_7
connector_data_6
update
technology_16
to
it
binlogs
and
slave
component_12
ask
connector_data_6
base
on
an
offset
the
component_3
be
pretty
quality_attribute_3
and
don’t
care
about
the
component_10
much
that
quality_attribute_7
make
it
super
fast
and
low
on
resource
old
connector_data_6
can
be
retain
on
a
time
base

expire_logs_days
and
or
on
a
storage
usage
base
so
if
the
component_3
doesn’t
keep
track
of
what
have
be
connector_8
on
each
topic
how
can
you
have
multiple
component_12
the
miss
element
here
be
technology_17
the
technology_2
component_3
us
technology_17
for
cluster
membership
and
connector_9
while
the
component_10
can
also
use
technology_17
or
something
else
for
synchronization
the
sample
component_12
provide
with
the
component_3
us
technology_17
so
you
can
launch
many
instance
and
they’ll
synchronize
automatically
for
the
one
that
doesn’t
technology_17
it
be
a
highly
quality_attribute_4
pattern_5
quality_attribute_8
storage
component_13
if
you
corosync
it
provide
somewhat
the
same
requirement_11
feature
wise
technology_2
isn’t
that
great
there’s
no
web
frontend
build
in
although
a
few
be
quality_attribute_4
in
the
ecosystem
connector_9
and
rule
be
inexistent
and
stats
be
with
technology_18
but
the
performance…i
reach
a
publish
quality_attribute_9
of
165k
connector_data_1
s
over
a
single
component_9
and
i
didn’t
bother
tune
for
more
connector_10
be
essentially
disk
bind
on
the
component_3
3m
connector_data_1
s…
amaze
that
be
without
technology_17
coordination
memory
and
cpu
usage
be
modest
to
test
cluster
i
create
a
replicate
component_7
insert
a
few
connector_data_1
stop
a
replica
insert
a
few
million
more
connector_data_6
and
restart
the
replica
i
take
only
a
few
second
to
resync
so
technology_2
be
very
quality_attribute_2
fit
for
the
requirement
stellar
requirement_6
low
resource
usage
and
nice
fit
with
the
requirement
technology_19
technology_19
be
another
big
player
in
the
with
an
impressive
feature
set
technology_19
be
more
in
the
technology_1
league
than
technology_2
and
technology_2
it
be
connector_3
in
technology_4
ha
can
be
provide
by
the
storage
backend
leveldb
support
pattern_6
but
i
connector_2
some
issue
with
it
my
requirement
be
not
for
full
ha
to
make
sure
the
pattern_4
be
never
block
so
i
drop
the
storage
backend
pattern_6
in
favor
of
a
mesh
of
pattern_1
my
understand
of
the
mesh
of
pattern_1
be
that
you
connector_11
to
one
of
the
member
and
you
publish
or
connector_8
a
connector_data_1
you
don’t
on
which
technology_6
s
the
component_7
be
locate
the
pattern_1
you
connector_11
to

and
connector_12
your
connector_data_7
to
further
help
you
can
specify
all
the
pattern_1
on
the
connector_13
coding_keyword_2
and
the
component_5
technology_20
will
reconnect
to
another
if
the
one
you
be
connector_14
to
go
down
that
look
pretty
quality_attribute_2
for
the
requirement
with
the
mesh
of
pattern_1
setup
i
connector_2
an
insert
rate
of
about

msg
s
over

component_8
and
a
single
component_12
be
able
to
connector_15

msg
s
i
coding_keyword_3
it
run
for
a
while
and
connector_2
150m
connector_data_1
at
this
point
though
i
lose
the
web
and
the
publish
rate
be
much
slow
so
a
big
beast
lot
of
feature
decent
requirement_6
on
the
edge
with
the
requirement
kestrel
kestrel
be
another
interest
pattern_1
this
time
more
technology_2
connector_3
in
technology_21
the
kestrel
pattern_1
speak
the
memcached
technology_12
basically
the
key
become
the
component_7
name
and
the
connector_data_5
be
the
connector_data_1
kestrel
be
very
quality_attribute_3
component_2
be
define
in
a
configuration
but
you
can
specify
per
component_7
storage
limit
expiration
and
behavior
when
limit
be
reach
with
a
set
“
discardoldwhenfull
=
true
”
my
requirement
of
never
pattern_7
the
pattern_4
be
easily
meet
in
term
of
cluster
kestrel
be
a
bit
limit
but
each
can
publish
it
quality_attribute_10
to
technology_17
so
that
pattern_4
and
component_10
can
be
inform
of
a
miss
component_3
and
adjust
of

if
you
have
many
kestrel
component_14
with
the
same
component_7
define
the
component_10
will
need
to
query
all
of
the
pattern_1
to
connector_2
the
connector_data_1
back
and
strict
order
can
be
a
bit
hard
in
term
of
requirement_6
a
few
quality_attribute_3
bash
script
use
nc
to
publish
connector_data_6
easily
reach
10k
connector_data_1
which
be
very
quality_attribute_2
the
rate
be
coding_keyword_4
over
time
and
likely
limit
by
the
reconnection
for
each
connector_data_1
the
presence
of
component_10
slightly
reduce
the
publish
rate
but
nothing
drastic
the
only
issue
i
have
be
when
a
large
number
of
connector_data_6
expire
the
component_3
freeze
for
some
time
but
that
be
because
i
forget
to
set
maxexpiresweep
to
something

and
all
the
connector_data_6
be
remove
in
one
pass
so
fairly
quality_attribute_2
impression
on
kestrel
quality_attribute_3
but
work
well
conclusion
for
the
requirement
give
by
the
requirement_7
technology_2
be
a
natural
fit
it
offer
a
high
guarantee
that
the
component_15
will
be
quality_attribute_4
and
pattern_8
under
any
circumstance
in
addition
connector_data_6
can
easily
be
replicate
for
high
connector_data_2
quality_attribute_10
