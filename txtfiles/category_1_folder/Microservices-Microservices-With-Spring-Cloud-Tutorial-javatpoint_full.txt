be
a

orient
architecture
in
the
pattern_5
architecture
there
be
a
large
number
of
pattern_1
by
combine
all
the
pattern_1
it
construct
a
big
component_4
in
the
pattern_5

all
the

connector_4
with
each

in

we

we

we
will

pattern_1
with

our
pattern_1
discus
the
basic
requirement_3
of
pattern_5
architecture
along
with
relevant
example
for
easy
understand
what
be
pattern_1
definition
accord
to
sam
newman
pattern_1
be
the
small
component_7
that
work
together
accord
to
james
lewis
and
martin
fowler
the
pattern_5
architectural
style
be
an
approach
to
develop
a
single
component_8
a
a
suite
of
small
component_4
each
pattern_5
run
it
component_9
and
connector_7
with
lightweight
mechanism
these
component_7
be
build
around
requirement_4
capability
and
independently
develop
by
fully
automate
deployment
machinery
there
be
a
bare
minimum
of
centralized
requirement_5
of
these
component_4
which
be
connector_8
in
different
programming
technology_10
and
use
different
connector_data_1
storage
technology_11
point
to
remember
these
be
the
component_7
which
be
connector_9
by
rest
these
be
small
well
chosen
quality_attribute_4
unit
the
component_7
must
be
requirement_1
enable
the
pattern_5
define
an
approach
to
the
architecture
that
divide
an
component_8
into
a
pool
of
loosely
couple
component_7
that
connector_10
requirement_4
requirement
it
be
next
to
pattern_9
architecture
technology_12
the
most
important
feature
of
the
pattern_5
base
architecture
be
that
it
can
perform
continuous
delivery
of
a
large
and
complex
component_8
pattern_5
help
in
break
the
component_8
and
build
a
logically
independent
small
component_8
for
example
we
can
build
a
requirement_1
component_8
with
the
help
of
technology_13
with
minimum
effort
in
the
above
figure
each
pattern_5
have
it
own
requirement_4
pattern_10
and
component_10
if
we
connector_11
in
one
pattern_5
it
do
not
affect
the
other
component_4
these
component_7
connector_4
with
each
other
by
use
lightweight
technology_14
such
a
technology_15
or
pattern_7
or
pattern_11
technology_14
principle
of
pattern_1
there
be
the
follow
principle
of
pattern_1
single
responsibility
principle
component_11
around
requirement_4
domain
isolate
failure
infrastructure
automation
quality_attribute_5
independently
single
responsibility
principle
the
single
responsibility
principle
state
that
a
or
a
in
a
component_12
should
have
only
one
responsibility
any
pattern_5
cannot
serve
more
than
one
responsibility
at
a
time
component_11
around
requirement_4
domain
pattern_5
never
restrict
itself
from
connector_12
appropriate
technology_11
technology_16
or
component_10
the
technology_16
or
component_10
be
most
suitable
for
solve
the
requirement_4
purpose
isolate
failure
the
large
component_8
can
remain
mostly
unaffected
by
the
failure
of
a
single
it
be
possible
that
a
component_4
can
fail
at
any
time
so
it
be
important
to
detect
failure
quickly
if
possible
automatically
restore
failure
infrastructure
automation
the
infrastructure
automation
be
the
component_9
of
script
environment
with
the
help
of
script
environment
we
can
apply
the
same
configuration
to
a
single
technology_17
or
thousand
of
technology_17
it
be
also
a
configuration
requirement_5
scripted
infrastructure
and
component_13
configuration
requirement_5
quality_attribute_5
independently
pattern_1
be
component_14
agnostic
it
mean
we
can
design
and
quality_attribute_5
them
independently
without
affect
the
other
component_4
audience
our
pattern_1
be
design
for
professional
and
beginner
who
want
to
pattern_1
architecture
in
easy
step
this
will
give
you
an

after
complete
this
you
can

with
technology_1

prerequisite
before
continue
with
this
you
should
have
a
basic
understand
of

technology_1
and
technology_1
requirement_1

because
we
be
go

use

we
assure
you
that
you
