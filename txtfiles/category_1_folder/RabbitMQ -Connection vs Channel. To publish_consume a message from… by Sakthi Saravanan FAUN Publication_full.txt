connector_1
vs
channelto
publish
connector_2
a
connector_data_1
from
technology_1
firstly
we
need
to
connector_3
to
the
technology_1
instance
this
be
a
technology_2
base
connector_1
secondly
we
need
to
have
a
virtual
connector_1
pattern_1
inside
the
technology_2
connector_1
thirdly
we
need
to
declare
an
exchange
and
component_1
then
bind
them
finally
connector_data_2
can
be
connector_4
and
connector_5
over
the
pattern_1
below
picture
show
step
involve
to
connector_4
connector_5
a
connector_data_1
from
technology_1
step
to
connector_3
connector_4
connector_5
to
from
technology_1
instancewhat
why
technology_2
connector_1
be
not
sufficient
why
do
we
need
the
pattern_1
let’s
say
you
don’t
have
a
pattern_1
in
multi
component_2
architecture
you
need
a
separate
connector_1
per
component_2
that
lead
to
under
utilisation
of
technology_2
connector_1
also
it

overhead
to
the
operate
component_3
to
establish
a
many
technology_2
connector_1
it
require
during
peak
time
of
the
requirement_1
requirement_2
of
the
component_3
could
be
drastically
reduce
this
be
where
the
pattern_1
come
handy
it
create
virtual
connector_1
inside
a
technology_2
connector_1
it
straightaway
reduce
overhead
of
the
o
also
it
allow
u
to
perform
pattern_2
in
more
fast
quality_attribute_1
and
simultaneously
way
how
pattern_1
help
u
to
perform
in
parallel
assume
we
have
two
component_4
‘a’
and
‘b’
want
to
talk
to
each
other
through
a
technology_1
instance
with
one
technology_2
connector_1
with
one
pattern_1
a
show
in
below
figure
let’s
say
an
component_5
‘a’
listen
on
a
component_1
where
it
expect
some
connector_data_2
from
the
component_5
‘b’
once
it
connector_6
and
it
would
start
component_6
it
what
if
an
component_5
‘a’
want
to
connector_4
connector_data_1
to
the
component_5
‘b’
before
acknowledge
the
current

no
way
it
have
to
wait
until
component_6
finish
for
the
previous
transaction
make
in
that
pattern_1
we
could
improve
the
quality_attribute_2
of
connector_7
by
create
another
pattern_1
there
be
no
limit
on
the
count
a
show
in
below
figure
so
an
component_5
‘a’
will
connector_2
connector_data_1
from
the
component_1
at
the
same
time
it
can
publish
a
connector_data_1
too
in
different
pattern_1
this
be
how
connector_1
and
pattern_1
be
relate
in
technology_1
hope
it
give
some
thought
on
difference
between
the
connector_1
and
the
pattern_1
“a
quality_attribute_3
teacher
can
inspire
hope
ignite
the
imagination
and
instill
a
love
of
