in

component_3
technology_2
be
optimize
although
it
can
also
work
with
“slow”
component_3
still
deal
with
some
critical
situation
be
somehow
difficult
because
there
be
some
consequence
with
the
component_2
centric
design
of
it
however
there
be
one
major
limitation
that
be
each
component_2
can
have
only
one
logical
component_3
in
the
component_3
group
hence
that
imply
while
work
with
“slow”
connector_data_2
single
issue
slow
component_4
block
all
other
connector_data_2
submit
to
this
component_2
after
that
connector_data_1
although
we
can
resolve
these
issue
with
different
strategy
to
run
another
technology_2
component_3
group
and
synchronize
it
with
exist
component_3
in
order
to
avoid
duplicate
component_4
of
connector_data_1
b
what
be
technology_1
technology_1
support
a
huge
number
of
development
component_5
with
ease
of
use
and
maturity
basically
it
quality_attribute_1
nicely
about


msg
sec
on
a
single
component_1
although
a
we
more
component_1
it
also
quality_attribute_1
well
the
output
of
technology_1
design

technology_3
technology_2
architecture
and
it
fundamental
conceptsmessages
publish
to
component_6
through
exchange
point
multiple
component_7
can
connector_2
to
a
component_8
connector_data_1
pattern_1
quality_attribute_2
connector_data_2
across
all
quality_attribute_3
component_3
also
we
can
redeliver
the
connector_data_1
if
the
component_3
fail
delivery
order
guarantee
for
component_6
with
single
component_3
this
be
not
possible
when
the
component_8
have
multiple
component_3
hence
if
overall
quality_attribute_4
be
enough
for
our
requirement
this
connector_data_1
pattern_1
can
work
well
for
“fast”
component_3
however
in
work
with
“slow”
component_3
we
have
the
additional
benefit
for
suppose
if
some
component_3
be
stick
with
some
very
slow
component_4
other
connector_data_2
will
stick
in
the
component_8
a
well
unless
we
have
other
component_7
connector_2
that
say
by

more
component_7
to
the
component_8
we
be
bypass
component_4
limitation
so
we
need
to
run
another
component_4

hence
we
can

it
be

and
also
on

component_13
can
connector_11
a

it

in

traditional

technology_2
have

also
our

require

a
key
driver

choose
technology_3
technology_2
although
above

will
resolve
many

if
