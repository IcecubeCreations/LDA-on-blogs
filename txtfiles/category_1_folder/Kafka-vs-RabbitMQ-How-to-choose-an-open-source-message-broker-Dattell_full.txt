to

from
technology_1

technology_3
among
others
in

we
discus
the
primary
factor
to
consider
when
choose
a
connector_data_1
pattern_1
and
we
will
focus
on
two
of
the
most
popular
choice
technology_1
and
technology_2
connector_data_2
basic
for
technology_1
and

technology_1

out
this

for
a
detail
background
on
these
two
traditional

and
how
technology_1
work
the
term

be
use
for
pattern_3
implementation
refer
to
component_8
subscribe
to
connector_data_3
publish
to
particular
topic
there
be
two
type
of
subscription
ephemeral
and
quality_attribute_1
both
type
can
be
employ
when
use
technology_1
or
technology_2
however
the
specific
term
ephemeral
and
quality_attribute_1
be
more
often
use
when
discuss
technology_2
rather
than
technology_1
a
ephemeral
subscription
subscription

that
be
active
only
within
the
limit
that

in

even

benefit
of
kafkareplay
connector_data_1
one
of
the
key
highlight
of
technology_1
be
that
it
allow
the
component_13
to
replay
connector_data_1
this
be
especially
important
for
analytical
use
requirement_2
for
instance
if
you
be
track
component_14
connector_data_4
for
internet
of
thing
iot
sensor
and
discover
an
issue
with
your
component_15
not
connector_8
all
connector_data_4
then
you
can
replay
connector_data_4
to
replace
the
miss
connector_data_5
in
the
component_15
requirement_3
consideration
technology_1
also
pair
well
with
requirement_3
component_16
such
a
elasticsearch
and
technology_9
we
serve
component_17
across
requirement_4
and
with
a
range
of
quality_attribute_2
that
be
best
suit
to
a
technology_1
connector_data_1
pattern_1
and
high
capacity
backend
the
two
component_3
work
well
together

support

technology_1
allow

to
be

this
feature
be
important
because
it
allow
multiple
component_8
to
handle
a
portion
of
the
connector_6
