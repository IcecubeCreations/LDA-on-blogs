be
a
phrase
that
be
coin
to
refer
to
amount
of
datasets
that
be
so
large
traditional
connector_data_1
component_1
simply
can’t
manage
them
for
example
requirement_1
be
use
to
pick
out
trend
in
economics
and
those
trend
and
pattern_1
be
use
to
predict
what
will
happen
in
the
future
these
vast
amount
of
connector_data_1
require
more
quality_attribute_1
component_2
for
component_1
best
handle
by
connector_data_1
component_1
technology_1
these
be
the
top
prefer
connector_data_1
component_1
technology_1
suitable
for
meet
a
variety
of
different
need
of
requirement_2
technology_2
this
be
an

pattern_2
component_1
technology_1
that
can
be
use
for
the
quality_attribute_2
storage
and
component_1
of
requirement_1
set
technology_2
rely
on
component_2
cluster
and
that
have
be
design
with
the
assumption
that
hardware
will
inevitably
fail
and
those
failure
should
be
automatically
handle
by
the
technology_1
there
be
four
within
technology_2
technology_2
common
be
where
the

and
utility
need
by
other

reside
the

technology_4
be
the

that
connector_1
the

yet
another

for

connector_data_1
component_1
technology_2
operate
by
split
into
large
block
of
connector_data_1
and
then
quality_attribute_2
those
datasets
across
the
technology_6
in
a
cluster
it
then
transfer
into
the
technology_6
for
component_1
connector_data_1
in
parallel
the
idea
of
connector_data_1
locality
mean
that
connector_data_2
be
perform
on

that
connector_1
the

allow
the

to
be
component_1
more
efficiently

technology_1
that
have
the
capability
of

technology_8
be
most
notably
easy
to

to
connector_3
component_8
in

and
r
this
open
component_3
technology_12
technology_1
be
ideal
for

but
do
require
a
cluster
manager
and
a
quality_attribute_2
storage
component_4
technology_8
can
be
run
on
a
single
component_9
with
one
executor
for
every
cpu
core
it
can
be
use
a
a
standalone
technology_1
and
you
can
also
use
it
in

with
technology_2
or
technology_7
