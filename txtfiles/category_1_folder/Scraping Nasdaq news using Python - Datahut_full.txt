requirement_1
there
be
an
increasing
effort
to
understand
the

dynamic
of
requirement_2
requirement_1
to
predict
the

and
it’s
a
predict

to
obtain
the

you
can
use

or
you
can
make
use
of

to
perform
this
this

that
can
help
one
for

however
complex
this
scenario
be
the
prime
requirement
for
all
these

connector_data_1
the
requirement_2
connector_data_1
be
generally
quality_attribute_5
with

but
there
be
a
cost
attach
to
it
if

come
to
your

hence
it
be
essential
to

to

our
goalour
goal
in
this
be
to
the

of
scrap
nasdaq

we
will
be
scrap

about
most
active

we
will
be
use

furthermore
we
will
use

you
be
completely
to
the
component_6
of
web
scrap
we
will
go
step
by
step
in
this
hence
in
the
end
you
will
able
to
comprehend
the
entire
scrap
pipeline
easily
before
directly
jump
to
the
implementation
of
scrap
nasdaq
news
u
have
a
look
a
the

pipeline
we
be
go
to
follow
pipeline
for
scrap
nasdaq
newsto
connector_7
the
scrap
of
nasdaq
news
for
requirement_2
requirement_3
connector_data_1
we
need
to
follow
few
step
by
step
and
we
will
be
do
firstly
we
will
be
set
up
the
target
url
and
will
download
all
the
connector_data_1
quality_attribute_5
from
the
target
url
after
that
our
connector_data_2
be
to
search
through
the
download
connector_data_1
for
our
require
connector_data_3
this
be
more
a
match
component_6
where
we
be
look
for
specific
pattern_2
in
the
connector_data_1
and
extract
them
out
use
these
pattern_2
after
the
extraction
of
the
connector_data_1
we
will
try
to
visualise
this
connector_data_1
for
quality_attribute_6
understand
and
connector_8
it
with
u
stage
decide
the
scrap
parametersone
of
the
most
important
connector_data_4
in
web
scrap
be
analyse
the
technology_8
connector_data_5
of
the
target
web
component_8
here
we
be
look
to
find
the
pattern_2
in
the
technology_8
connector_data_5
of
the
connector_data_1
these
pattern_2
be
the
essential
in
extract
connector_data_1
from
the
web
component_8
we
will
look
for
some
recur
technology_8
connector_data_5
or
technology_8
tag
and
u
try
to
find
some
pattern_2
in
our
requirement_7
below
be
the
technology_8
snippet
of
the
target
requirement_2
requirement_3
component_9
which
we
be
go
to
scrape
target
web
component_8
for
scrap
nasdaq
newson
the
most
active
requirement_2
component_8
you
can
use
leave
click
and
do
inspect
element
on
the
component_8
after
that
you
can
use
hover
requirement_10
to
find
the
technology_8
for
the
target
requirement_2
component_9
here
you
can
see
in
the
image
that
the
requirement_2
component_9
be
connector_data_6
to
a
name
“gentable”
in
the
this
give
u
the
hook
to
look
for
the
entire
component_9
in
the
technology_8
while
scrap
it
hence
here
our
approach
will
be
that
we
will
look
for
the
specify
component_9
first
after
find
the
component_9
we
will
iterate
over
the
component_9
row
one

and
extract
the
