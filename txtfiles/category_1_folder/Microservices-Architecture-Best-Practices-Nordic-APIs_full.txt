saleh
argue
that

”clayton
also
say
that
while

be
mean
to
be

quality_attribute_3
independently
there’s
a
strong
desire
to
connector_12

“you
can
either
replicate
requirement_10
across
component_15
and
increase
the
quality_attribute_10
burden
or
you
need
to
carefully

”similarly
selah
mention
that

the

how

clayton
argue
that

shouldn’t

the
de

architecture
if
your

already

it’s
a

way

he
also
follow

advice
in
recommend
that

must
be
keep
quality_attribute_11
consciously
avoid
the
natural
habit
of
go
granular
from

and
he
recommend
that
you
build
your
pattern_3
on

of

you
don’t

the

challenge
#4
how
can
component_15
connector_3
with
each
other
since
each
part
work
independently
there
be
the
risk
of
quality_attribute_16
when
each
piece
be
bring
together
while
the
whole
point
of
pattern_1
be
that
they
be
able
to
work
independently
they
need
to
work
together
which
can
be
a
repeat
challenge
particularly
when
many
component_15
be
make
connector_data_1
to
many
others
you
can
have
a
“dogpile”
of
connector_data_4
—
when
one
component_13
go
down
while
the
other
connector_18
component_15
don’t
have
any
time
out
mechanism
eventually
the

collapse
saleh
say
you
can
create
a
circuit
breaker
which
act
a
discovery
component_13
where
one
pattern_3
realize
another
be
“sick”
and
connector_19
the
circuit
breaker
from
that
point
on
a

will
be
able

it

more
quickly
but
how
each

a
lewis
and
fowler
put
it
“it
mean
that
the
conceptual

will
differ

this
be
a
common
issue
when

across

the
‘sales

differ
from

some
thing
that
be
connector_2

‘sales

all

”
when
connector_data_3
be
manage
separately
semantics
could
truly
make
or
break
an
update
”according
to
lewis
and
fowler
a
quality_attribute_1
way
to
overcome
this
hurdle
—
which
reside
among
pattern_1
and
with
external
component_1
—
be
through
domain
drive
design
ddd
divide
and
re
bundle
complex
domain
into
multiple
bound
component_26
which
then
connector_data_6
out
the
relationship
between
them
you
can
also
choose
to
manage
inconsistency
by
use
transaction
which
test
the
quality_attribute_18
of
the
connector_22
before
release
an
update
however
quality_attribute_19
transaction
be
notoriously
difficult
to
connector_1
lewis
and
fowler
say
that
none
of
these
fix
be
perfect
but
“the
requirement_12
off
be
worth
it
a
long
a
the
cost
of

mistake
be
le
than
the
cost
of
lose

great
consistency
”in
conclusion
be

let’s
sum
up
the
benefit
and
drawback
of
use
