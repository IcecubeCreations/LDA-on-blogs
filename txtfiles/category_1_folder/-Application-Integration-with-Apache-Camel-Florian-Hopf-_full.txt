technology_1
technology_2
be
a
very
useful
technology_3
when
it
come
to
quality_attribute_1
different
component_2
and
technology_4
in
this
i
will
introduce
some
of
it
concept
and
show
how
you
can
test
and
run
your
component_1
use
technology_5
technology_1
technology_2
technology_2
be
an
implementation
of
many
requirement_1
pattern_1
mostly
inspire
by
the
book
requirement_2
requirement_1
pattern_1
connector_data_1
be
pass
through
pattern_2
from
to
and
along
the
way
they
can
be
pattern_3
pattern_4
and
connector_1
to
other
pattern_2

this
be
take
from
the
for
the
book
besides
the
requirement_1
pattern_1
technology_1
technology_2
offer
implementation
of
many
technology_6
and
technology_4
in
it
component_3
this
mean
not
only
can
you
build
your
component_1
base
on
the
pattern_1
above
but
there
be
also
the
groundwork
for
do
technical
requirement_1
one
example
be
connector_2
from
an
technology_7
component_4
or
download
connector_data_2
from
an
component_4
to
use
technology_2
effectively
you
need
to
understand
a
few
concept
describe
how
to
connector_3
external
component_5
each
be
handle
by
a
component_3
which
register
prefix
during
runtime
some
component_6
be
quality_attribute_2
with
the
core
technology_2
connector_4
some
need
to
be

explicitly
example
for
component_6
be
the
mailcomponent
for
connector_5
and
connector_6

rabbitcomponent
for
use
with
technology_8
and
filecomponent
that
provide
requirement_3
for
connector_2
and
connector_7

be
be
configure
by
uris
each
component_3
provide
a
prefix
that
determine
if
it
s
responsible
for
an
uri
an
example
uri
for
the
filecomponent

opt
storage
move=
success&movefailed=
error
this
will
pattern_5
the
directory
opt
storage
for

if
a
be
component_7
successfully
it
be
move
to
the
folder
success
if
there
be
an
error
it
be
move
to
error
another
example
for
technology_8
that
can
be
use
for
connector_6
or
connector_5
connector_data_3
technology_8
component_8

username=op&password=op
the
documentation
of
the
component_6
normally
provide
a
component_9
with
a
description
of
all
the
parameter
that
be
quality_attribute_2
connector_1
be
be
connector_8
by
connector_1
most
of
the
time
you
will
use
the
nice
technology_9
dsl
which
be
quality_attribute_2
if
you
extend
your
from
routebuilder
a
quality_attribute_3
example
that
pattern_5
from
a
folder
and
connector_9
them
to
technology_8
from
âfile
opt
attachmentsâ
to
ârabbitmq
component_8

â
besides
directly
connector_10
you
can
also
use
pattern_4
to
skip
some
connector_data_1
and
choice
to
connector_11
them
to
different

or
you
can
have
any
other
component_7
that
you
wish
in
between
exchange
exchange
be
container
for
the
current
connector_data_3
flow
not
to
be
confuse
with
the
term
exchange
in
the
technology_10
world
it
s
a
wrapper
the
contain
the
in
out
connector_data_3
and
potential
error
a
connector_data_3
consist
of
a

that
might
keep
component_3
specific
connector_data_4
the
filename
for
the
filecomponent
and
a
body
processor
a
processor
be
anything
that
do
work
in
a
connector_12
pattern_4
and
choice
mention
above
be
processor
but
you
can
also
do
other
connector_data_5
by
connector_13
the
processor

e
g
if
you
want
to
do
some
transformation
@override
component_7
exchange
exchange
throw
exception
{
}
this
processor
can
be
register
in
the
connector_12
by

a
component_7

myprocessor
test
technology_2
provide
support
for
test
connector_1
in
isolation
by
replace
with
mock

inject
use
advicewithroutebuilder
connector_data_1
can
be
connector_14
to
you
use
the
messageproducertemplate
you
can
then
assert
that
a
connector_data_3
be
arrive
at
the
mock

assertissatisfied
test
can
be
a
bit
special
when
it
come
to
technology_1
technology_2
a
some
of
the
component_7
be
be
do
asynchronously
runtime
when
use
technology_2
standalone
you
have
to
take
care
to
start
a
camelcontext
which
hold
all
the
configure
component_6
and
connector_1
when
use
technology_5
you
can
use
the
technology_5
boot
technology_2
starter
that
will
manage
the
camelcontext
for
you
you
create
connector_1
and
annotate
the
with
@bean
by
set
the
property
technology_2
springboot

run
controller=true
the
component_1
will
stay
alive
even
if
you
haven
t
include
something
technology_5
mvc
conclusion
i
really
the
component_10
of
technology_1
technology_2
it
provide
pattern_6
component_7
and
you
can
decouple
different
part
of
the
component_7
e
g
by
first
download
to
a
certain
folder
and
then
requirement_4
them
in
another
connector_12
both
of
those
connector_data_5
can
run
in
isolation
besides
all
the
different
technology_6
that
be
connector_15
technology_1
technology_2
also
provide
solution
for
cross
cut
concern
error
handle
the
declarative
approach
can
make
it
a
bit
hard
to
start
for
beginner
but
once
you
find
your
way
around
there
be
also
a
lot
of
potential
please
