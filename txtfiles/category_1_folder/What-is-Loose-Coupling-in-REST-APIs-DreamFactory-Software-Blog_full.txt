connector_1

what
be
loose
couple
it
importance
in
pattern_1
component_1
design
one
of
the
most
important
idea
in
the
world
of
engineering
be
the
concept
of
loose
couple
in
a
loosely
couple
design
component_4
be
independent
and
connector_2
in
one
will
not
affect
the
of
others
this
approach
offer
optimal
quality_attribute_1
and
re
quality_attribute_2
when
component_4
be

replace
or
modify
loosely
couple
vs
tightly
coupledconversely
a
tightly
couple
design
mean
that
component_4
tend
to
be
interdependent
connector_2
in
a
single
component_5
can
have
a
component_6
wide
impact
with
unanticipated
and
undesirable
effect
the
requirement_2
of
loosely
couple
component_7
be
widely
recognize
in
the
world
but
unfortunately
most
requirement_3
component_8
end
up
be
tightly
couple
to
the
pattern_1
component_1
component_3
that
they
use
each
component_9
side
component_1
be
often
develop
for
a
specific
requirement_3
component_10
project
each
custom
component_10
then
require
another
special
purpose
pattern_1
technology_1
in
other
word
the
component_10
and
the
component_2
end
up
be
tightly
couple
to
one
another
develop
a
pattern_1
component_1
for
every
project
lead
to
backend
complexity
over
time
a
requirement_4
can
end
up
with
infrastructure
that
be
not
quality_attribute_3
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_5
or
quality_attribute_6
i
have
connector_3
about
the
problem
of
develop
pattern_1
component_11
for
every
project
elsewhere
but
now
i
think
this
warn
should
be
even
more
strongly
word
requirement_4
should
never
develop
a
pattern_1
component_1
for
any
specific
component_10
please
connector_4
that
again
it’s
a
game
changer
you
should
never
develop
a
pattern_1
component_1
for
any
specific
component_10
this
practice
almost
always
connector_data_1
in
an
component_10
that
be
tightly
couple
to
a
custom
build
component_2
generate
a
full
feature
document
and
quality_attribute_6
pattern_1
component_1
in
minute
sign
up
for
our
free

day
component_12
trial
to
how
generate
your
no
pattern_1
component_1
now
key
advantagesthe
best
approach
be
to
build
a
pattern_1
component_1
component_13
that
can
be
use
and
quality_attribute_7
in
a
quality_attribute_8
manner
for
general
purpose
component_10
development
the
advantage
be
enormous
for
example
developer
don’t
need
to
a
component_1
to
develop
a
component_10
the
same
component_11
can
be
quality_attribute_7
for
many
different
purpose
the
total
number
of
component_3
and
be
consolidate
improve
quality_attribute_9
documentation
component_14
role
and
component_1
component_3
become
standardize
enhance
corporate
governance
and
compliance
when
a
requirement_3
component_10
be
develop
there
be
usually
a
component_9
side
team
that
build
the
pattern_1
component_1
and
a
component_15
side
team
that
build
the
component_10
the
connector_5
between
these
two
group
take
lot
of
time
and
money
while
they
converge
on
an

in
fact
gartner
estimate
that
75%
of
the
cost
of
a
requirement_3
project
be
relate
to
backend
requirement_5
and
for
this
reason
the
big
benefit
of
a
loosely
couple
pattern_1
component_1
architecture
be
that
the
connector_5
between
these
two
team
be
minimize
this
be
where
the
concept
of
a
loosely
couple
pattern_1
component_1
component_13
really
generate
requirement_6
requirement_2
component_4
that
need
to
“know
things”
about
each
other
be
tightly
couple
component_4
that
can
operate
independently
and
have
a
well
define
connector_6
pattern_2
be
loosely
couple
in
the
same
manner
if
your
component_9
side
team
be
deeply
engage
with
your
component_15
side
team
then
they
be
tightly
couple
a
well
these
two
team
can
end
up
spend
lot
of
time
play
an
expensive
game
of
component_1
pattern_3
pong
instead
of
ship
component_10
a
a
veteran
engineer
i
find
one
aspect
of
this
situation
rather
fascinate
usually
loose
couple
be
a
best
practice
for
connector_data_2
orient
design
if
you
leave
some
tightly
couple
in
the
somewhere
then
the
worst
requirement_7
scenario
be
probably
a
few
snarky

from
one
of
the
other
engineer
over
lunch
but
in
this
situation
there
be
two
distinct
development
team
and
their
connector_5
be
define
by
the
pattern_1
component_1
they
be
build
bad
design
infect
their
work
relationship
and
this
have
real
world
consequence
in
term
of
time
and
money
a
component_13
approach
to
pattern_4
component_3
connector_2
all
of
this
the
component_9
side
team
focus
on
mobilize
connector_data_3
component_16
connector_7
component_17
component_2
and
administer
role
base
quality_attribute_9
for
the
component_13
the
front
end
team
then
build
anything
they
want
on
their
component_13
of
choice
problem
be
minimize
because
the
developer
automatically
connector_8
the
component_3
that
they
need
but
what
type
of
can
actually
connector_9
a
component_6
this
embrace
functional
and
agile
component_1
design
with
dreamfactoryimagine
that
a
modern
developer
could
requirement_8
into
a
portal
select
the
type
of
component_10
that
they
want
to
build
and
instantly
connector_10
a
comprehensive
palette
of
pattern_1
component_1
component_3
design
for
that
purpose
and
vet
for
use
by
their
it
department
this
be
a
tangible
roadmap
for
the
modern
requirement_9
to
embrace
loosely
couple
design
and
take
this
vision
to
the
next
level
by
combine
quality_attribute_6
administration
with
agile
component_13
orient
component_10
development
the
dreamfactory
professional
package
provide
this
requirement_10
a
requirement_4
or
component_2
technology_2
can
component_12
and
manage
hundred
or
thousand
of
individual
dreamfactory
instance
each
one
be
a
complete
pattern_1
component_1
development
component_13
next
the
administrator
can
define
any
number
of
pre
configure
pattern_1
component_1
package
for
various
purpose
example
might
include
component_3
for
iot
telephony
requirement_3
component_10
connector_data_4
etc
these
package
can
include
third
party
component_3
stripe
or
technology_3
component_17
technology_4
component_2
and
role
base
connector_11
to
any
number
of
technology_5
or
technology_6
component_18
all
a
modern
developer
have
to
do
be
sign
up
select
a
package
and
start
build
the
component_15
component_10
this
be
where
dreamfactory
be

mean
instantly
provide
