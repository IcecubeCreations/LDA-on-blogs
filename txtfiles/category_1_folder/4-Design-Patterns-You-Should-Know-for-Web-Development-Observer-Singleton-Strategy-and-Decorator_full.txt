have
you
ever
be
on
a
team
where
you
need
to
start
a
project
from
scratch
that
s
usually
the
requirement_1
in
many
start
up
and
other
small
requirement_2
there
be
so
many
different
programming
technology_1
architecture
and
other
concern
that
it
can
be
difficult
to
figure
out
where
to
start
that
s
where
design
pattern_1
come
in
a
design
pattern_1
be
a
template
for
your
project
it
u
certain
convention
and
you
can
expect
a
specific
kind
of
behavior
from
it
these
pattern_1
be
make
up
of
many
developer
experience
so
they
be
really
different
set
of
best
practice
and
you
and
your
team
connector_1
to
decide
which
set
of
best
practice
be
the
most
useful
for
your
project
base
on
the
design
pattern_1
you
choose
you
all
will
start
to
have
expectation
for
what
the
should
be
do
and
what
vocabulary
you
all
will
be
use
programming
design
pattern_1
can
be
use
across
all
programming
technology_1
and
can
be
use
to
fit
any
project
because
they
only
give
you
a
general
outline
of
a
solution
there
be
official
pattern_1
from
the
book
design
pattern_1
element
of
quality_attribute_1
connector_data_1
orient
which
be
consider
one
of
the
most
influential
book
on
connector_data_1
orient
theory
and
development
in
this
i
m
go
to
cover
four
of
those
design
pattern_1
to
give
you
some
insight
to
what
a
few
of
the
pattern_1
be
and
when
you
would
use
them
the
singleton
design
patternthe
singleton
pattern_1
only
allow
a
or
connector_data_1
to
have
a
single
instance
and
it
u
a
global
variable
to
component_1
that
instance
you
can
use
lazy
loading
to
make
sure
that
there
be
only
one
instance
of
the
because
it
will
only
create
the
when
you
need
it
that
prevent
multiple
instance
from
be
active
at
the
same
time
which
could
cause
weird
bug
most
of
the
time
this
connector_2
connector_3
in
the
constructor
the
goal
of
the
singleton
pattern_1
be
typically
to
regulate
the
global
state
of
an
component_2
an
example
of
a
singleton
that
you
probably
use
all
the
time
be
your
logger
if
you
work
with
some
of
the
front
end
technology_2
technology_3
or
angular
you
all
about
how
tricky
it
can
be
to
handle
requirement_3
come
from
multiple
component_3
this
be
a
great
example
of
singleton
in
action
because
you
never
want
more
than
one
instance
of
a
logger
connector_data_1
especially
if
you
re
use
some
kind
of
error

when

you

this

pattern_1
in

you
t
have
to
worry
about
connector_6
the
requirement_3
from
the
component_2
you
can
connector_1
them
from
anywhere
in
your
base
and
they
will
all
go
to
the
exact
same
instance
of
the

which
mean
none
of
your
requirement_3
should
connector_1
lose
due
to

the
strategy
design
patternthe
strategy
be
pattern_1
be
an
advance
version
of
an
if
else
statement
it
s
basically
where
you
make
an
for
a
you
have
in
your
base
this
be
then
use
to
find
the
right
implementation
of
that
that
should
be
use
in
a
derive
the
implementation
in
this
requirement_1
will
be
decide
at
runtime
base
on
the
component_4
this
pattern_1
be
incredibly
useful
in
situation
where
you
have
require
and
optional
for
a
some
instance
of
that
win
t
need
the
optional
and
that
cause
a
problem
for
inheritance
solution
you
could
use
for
the
optional
but
then
you
would
have
to
connector_7
the
implementation
every
time
you
use
that
since
there
would
be
no
default
implementation
that
s
where
the
strategy
pattern_1
connector_8
u
instead
of
the
component_4
look
for
an
implementation
it
delegate
to
a
strategy
and
the
strategy
find
the
right
implementation
one
common
use
for
this
be
with
payment
component_5
component_6
you
could
have
a
shop
cart
that
only
requirement_4
connector_9
out
with
their
credit
card
but
you
will
lose
requirement_4
that
want
to
use
other
payment
the
strategy
design
pattern_1
u
decouple
the
payment
from
the
checkout
component_5
which
mean
we
can
or
update
strategy
without
connector_10
any
in
the
shop
cart
or
checkout
component_5
here
s
an
example
of

}an
example
of

our

we
make
a

multiple
each
take
the
same
parameter
customerinfo
and
that
parameter
have
a
define
type
of
customerinfotype
hey
all
you
typescript
devs
take
note
that
each
have
it
own
implementation
and
u
different
requirement_6
from
the
customerinfo
with
the
strategy
pattern_1
you
can
also
dynamically
connector_10
the
strategy
be
use
at
run

that
mean
you
ll
be
able
to
connector_10
the
strategy
or
implementation
be
use
base
on
component_7
input
or
the
environment
the
component_8
be
run
in
you
can
also
set
a

in
a
quality_attribute_2
config

at

a

start
go
through

component_5
on

the
default

they
encounter
will
be

which
come
from

technology_5
this
could
easily
be
update
if
the
requirement_4
select

we
a

of
so
we
have
the

strategy
quality_attribute_3
and
the

from

then
we
create
the
with
the

and
a
fallback
requirement_6
for
the
default
strategy
in
requirement_1
there
hasn
t
be
one
set
in
the

next
we
assign
the
strategy
requirement_6
to
a
local
state
variable
an
important
we
need
to
connector_3
in
our
checkout
be
the
ability
to
connector_10
the
payment
strategy
a
requirement_4
might
connector_10
the
payment
they
want
to
use
and
you
ll
need
to
be
able
to
handle
that
that
s
what
the
changestrategy
be
for
after
you
ve
do
some
fancy
cod
and
connector_1
all
of
the
input
from
a
requirement_4
then
you
can
update
the
payment
strategy
immediately
base
on
their
input
and
it
dynamically
set
the
strategy
before
the
payment
be
connector_12
for
component_5
at
some
point
you
might
need
to
more
payment
to
your
shop
cart
and
all
you
ll
have
to
do
be
it
to
the
paymentmethodstrategy
it
ll
instantly
be
quality_attribute_3
anywhere
that
be
use
the
strategy
design
pattern_1
be
a
powerful
one
when
you
be
deal
with
that
have
multiple
implementation
it
might
feel
you
re
use
an
but
you
t
have
to
connector_7
an
implementation
for
the
every
time
you
connector_data_2
it
in
a
different
it
give
you
more
quality_attribute_4
than
the
observer
design
patternif
you
ve
ever
use
the
pattern_2
pattern_1
you
ve
already
use
the
observer
design
pattern_1
the
component_9
part
be
a
subject
and
the
pattern_3
part
be
an
observer
of
that
subject
your
subject
hold
all
of
the
connector_data_3
and
the
state
of
that
connector_data_3
then
you
have
observer
different
component_3
that
will
connector_1
that
connector_data_3
from
the
subject
when
the
connector_data_3
have
be
update
the
goal
of
the
observer
design
pattern_1
be
to
create
this
one
to
many
relationship
between
the
subject
and
all
of
the
observer
wait
for
connector_data_3
so
they
can
be
update
so
anytime
the
state
of
the
subject
connector_10
all
of
the
observer
will
be
connector_13
and
update
instantly
some
example
of
when
you
would
use
this
pattern_1
include
connector_14
component_7
connector_data_4
update
pattern_4
and
handle
pattern_5
say
you
have
a
single
component_10
component_2
that
have
three
feature
dropdown
connector_data_5
that
be
dependent
on
the
selection
of
a
category
from
a
high
level
dropdown
this
be
common
on
many
shop
sit
home
depot
you
have
a
bunch
of
pattern_4
on
the
component_10
that
be
dependent
on
the
requirement_6
of
a
top
level
pattern_4
the
for
the
top

might
look
something
this

we

this
be
the
you
would
handle
connector_15
a

any
kind
of

you
want
to

their

when

be
an

of
what
you
can
do
with

once
it
have
be
connector_12
from

now
we

take

the
decorator

patternusing
the
decorator
design
pattern_1
be
fairly
quality_attribute_2
you
can
have
a
base
with
and
property
that
be
present
when
you
make
a
connector_data_1
with
the
now
say
you
have
some
instance
of
the
that
need
or
property
that
didn
t
come
from
the
base
you
can
those
extra
and
property
to
the
base
but
that
could
mess
up
your
other
instance
you
could
even
make
sub
to
hold
specific
and
property
you
need
that
you
can
t
put
in
your
base
either
of
those
approach
will
solve
your
problem
but
they
be
clunky
and
inefficient
that
s
where
the
decorator
pattern_1
step
in
instead
of
make
your
base
ugly
to
a
few
thing
to
an
connector_data_1
instance
you
can
tack
on
those
specific
thing
directly
to
the
instance
so
if
you
need
to
a
property
that
hold
the
requirement_5
for
an
connector_data_1
you
can
use
the
decorator
pattern_1
to
it
directly
to
that
particular
connector_data_1
instance
and
it
win
t
affect
any
other

of

have
you
ever

then
you

be
these
crazy
far

find
out
i
use
them
all
the
time
a
few
of
the
pattern_1
i
cover
be
use
in
so
many
component_13
that
it
would
blow
your
mind
they
be
theory
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
s
up
to
u
a
developer
to
use
that
theory
in
way
that
make
our
component_13
easy
to
connector_3
and
maintain
have
you
use
any
of
the
other
design
pattern_1
for
your
project
most
place

their
project
and
stick
with
it
