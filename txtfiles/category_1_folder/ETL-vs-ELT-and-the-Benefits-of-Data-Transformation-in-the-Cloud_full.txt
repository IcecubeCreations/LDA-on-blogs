what’s
the

while
percent
of

have
plan
to
adopt

already
adopt
a
digital
first
requirement_2
strategy
a
third
of
organization
say
that
the
need
to
replace

component_4
be
one
of
the
big
obstacle
digital

–
the
use
of
technology_2
to
create
requirement_8
in

component_5
requirement_9
experience
and
–
be
drive
by
connector_data_1
and
insight
when
incorporate

see
impressive
“return

at
an
average
of
more
than

annually
but
component_3
component_4
and
on

connector_data_1
requirement_10
be
inhibit
requirement_2
from
glean
insight
fast
enough
to
stay
competitive
move
connector_data_1
to
the
requirement_1
be
only
half
the
requirement_5
be
great
at
connector_2
connector_data_1
but
many
struggle
to
join
together
siloed
connector_data_1
from
different
component_6
to
requirement_2
component_7
and
embellish
metric
to
take
raw
“captured”
connector_data_1
and
turn
it
into
something
useful
organization
need
to
transform
connector_data_1
in
order
to
make
it
useful
and
this
need
to
happen
at
quality_attribute_3
inside
of
an
already
complex
it
environment
merely
ingest
connector_data_1
into
a
requirement_1
connector_data_1
requirement_10
–
or
rather
a
requirement_1
connector_data_1
requirement_10
component_8
–
do
not
necessarily
make
connector_data_1
useful
or
quality_attribute_4
it
be
the
transformation
of
that
connector_data_1
take
it
from
a
raw
normalize
state
to
connector_data_1
that
be
denormalized
and
ready
for
analysis
transform
connector_data_1
be
challenge
but
also
important
once
it’s
do
requirement_11
can
benefit
from
an
actual
connector_data_1
requirement_10
component_5
run
on

of

connector_data_1

a
it
stand
many
requirement_5
do
not

the

to
transform

into
an
requirement_12
ready
technology_3
the
connector_data_1
requirement_3
strategy
of
large
requirement_5
vary
wildly
some
remain
completely
on
prem
some
be
in
the
requirement_1
or
multiple
requirement_1
and
many
fall
somewhere
in
between
with
a
hybrid
of
both
in
fact
percent
of
requirement_5
have
at
least
one
component_1
or
a
portion
of
their
requirement_5
computing
infrastructure
in
the
requirement_1
for
requirement_11
look
to
be
insight
drive
requirement_1
connector_data_1
requirement_10
technology_4
bigquery
and
technology_5
synapse
be
the
practical
choice
over
their
on
prem
counterpart
the
rise
of
elt
a
requirement_11
transition
from
on
prem
to
the
requirement_1
they
can
also
move
toward
a
quality_attribute_5
connector_data_1
transformation
architecture
use
elt
rather
than
technology_1
technology_1
be
the
component_9
by
which
you
extract
connector_data_1
from
a
component_6
or
multiple
component_6
transform
it
with
an
technology_1
component_8
and
then
load
it
into
it
permanent
home
usually
a
connector_data_1
requirement_10
in
elt
you
extract
connector_data_1
from
the
component_6
load
it
unchanged
into
a
target
component_10
component_11
connector_data_1
requirement_10
connector_data_1
component_12
and
then
transform
the
connector_data_1
inside
the
requirement_10
itself
–
something
only
practical
in
the
requirement_1
with
elt
requirement_2
gain
quality_attribute_5
requirement_13
and
cost
connector_3
because
they
can
leverage
the
requirement_1
connector_data_1
requirement_10
to
transform
connector_data_1
with
elt
connector_data_1
professional
work
directly
and
natively
on
connector_data_1
inside
the
requirement_10
for
high
quality_attribute_6
fast
productivity
increase
quality_attribute_7
and
few
error
long
pattern_2
component_2
and
slow
development
be
essentially
eliminate
the
infrastructure
and
architecture
be
far
quality_attribute_8
and
can
be
quality_attribute_3
up
and
down
a
need
the
elt
component_9
reduce
waste
improve
quality_attribute_9
and
consign

to
the
history
book
end
component_13
see
significant
connector_3
on

quality_attribute_5
perform
workload
and
short
development
cycle
connector_data_1
be
quickly
quality_attribute_10
and
immediately
quality_attribute_11
for
transformation
and
analysis
a
well
elt
be
also
more
align
with
current
development
best
practice
if
developer
aren’t
sure
how
they
want
to
use
connector_data_1
they
have
the
freedom
to
apply
transformation
at
a
late
date
give
the
switch
to
different
development
strategy
and
the
rise
of
iterative
agile
methodology
this
capability
be
very
appeal
three
great
reason
for
elt
instead
of
technology_1
development
productivity
the
resource
need
to
work
in
an
technology_1
architecture
have
grow
a
the
amount
of
connector_data_1
grow
for
connector_data_1
transformation
within
technology_1
developer
need
a
fully
cod
before
they
could
even
begin
to
debug
and
validate
their
transformation
component_7
this
often
connector_data_3
in
an
iterative
component_9
of
make
connector_4
rerun
technology_1
and
re
validate
the
connector_data_4
use
elt
developer
can
perform
quick
real
time
connector_data_1
validation
before
run
and
debug
they
see
quicker
quality_attribute_9
to
development
and
few
error
test
no
long
take
hour
to
run
–
they
take
minute
go
be
the
burden
of
incomplete
or
fail
and
debug
developer
can
dedicate
their
time
to
connector_data_1
discovery
and
innovation
infrastructure
complexity
before
the
requirement_1
connector_data_1
requirement_10
connector_data_1
infrastructure
with
on
prem
component_3
component_4
be
complex
and
only
connector_5
more
so
a
requirement_2
demand
connector_4
and
connector_data_1
volume
increase
in
the
requirement_1
you
don’t
need
to
more
component_14
because
your
connector_data_1
need
have
grow
for
example
a
retail
requirement_2
be
seasonal
it
need
more
compute
power
and
storage
but
only
during
the
fourth
quarter
before
that
retailer
would
need
to
keep
connector_data_1
component_14
and
overhead
cost
high
all
year
in
anticipation
of
the
report
and
requirement_12
need
of
the
holiday
season
this
be
wasteful
for
their
it
budget
and
bottom
line
elt
allow
for
quality_attribute_7
and
quality_attribute_12
inside
the
connector_data_1
infrastructure
that
retailer
can
now
quality_attribute_3
resource
up
and
down
manage
the
cost
of
it
requirement_1
connector_data_1
requirement_10
and
avoid
be
lock
into
a
large
size
than
it
need
for
three
quarter
of
the
year
fast
requirement_13
of
common
with
an
technology_1
architecture
team
would
run
nightly
and
experience
long
pattern_2
window
because
there
be
only
so
much
compute
power
quality_attribute_11
in
the
organization
to
solve
this
problem
requirement_2
would
invest
money
in
more
component_15
which
would
take
month
to
see
requirement_8
think
rip
and
replace
technology_2
connector_6
component_9
train
team
on
the
hardware
and
make
connector_data_1
transformation
a
bottleneck
with
elt
your
requirement_1
connector_data_1
requirement_10
be
your
compute
component_8
this
mean
a
your
connector_data_1
volume
grow
you
can
easily
allocate
more
compute
power
and
quality_attribute_9
up
your
workflow
for
short
pattern_2
window
that
require
no
additional
hardware
be
elt
right
for
your
requirement_2
the
advantage
of
elt
be
clear
–
it
be
an
enhance
technology_2
that
put
the
hard
work
of
connector_data_1
transformation
in
the
hand
of
the
powerful
connector_data_1
requirement_10
and
an
underlie
requirement_1
but
be
it
the
right
approach
for
your
organization
a
elt
do
require
script
connector_7
which
when
do
manually
can
be
a
time
and
labor
intensive
component_9
that
much
hand
cod
might
not
be
a
viable
option
for
some
organization
and
the
likelihood
of
human
error
can
increase
especially
when
you
account
for
the
amount
of
connector_data_1
connector_data_1
component_6
and
output
involve
the
death
of
technology_1
so
be
technology_1
dead
the
component_9
of
extract
transform
and
loading
connector_data_1
be
still
necessary
but
a
the
technology_2
have
connector_4
and
so
have
the
gartner
predict
that
by
percent
of
all
component_11
will
be
on
a
requirement_1
component_10
elt
will
be
an
important
part
of
the
requirement_1
connector_data_1
requirement_3
strategy
for
