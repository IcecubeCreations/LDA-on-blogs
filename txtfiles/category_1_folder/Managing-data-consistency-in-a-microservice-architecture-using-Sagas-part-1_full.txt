the

part
pattern_2

why
saga
a
distinctive
characteristic
of
the
pattern_1
architecture
be
that
in
order
to
ensure
loose
couple
each
serviceâs
connector_data_1
be
private
unlike
in
a
monolithic
component_1
you
no
long
have
a
single
component_2
that
any
of
the
component_1
can
update
a
a
connector_data_2
one
of
the
key
challenge
that
you
will
face
be
maintain
connector_data_1
consistency
across
component_3
consider
for
example
the
requirement_1
and
order
example
component_1
from
my
presentation
it
consist
of
two
component_3
order
component_3
manage
order
include
createorder
and
cancelorder
requirement_1
component_3
manage
requirement_1
connector_data_3
include
the
customerâs
quality_attribute_1
credit
include
createcustomer
when
the
order
component_3
create
an
order
it
must
ensure
that
there
be
sufficient
credit
quality_attribute_1
specifically
the
createorder
command
must
update
connector_data_1
in
both
the
order
component_3
and
the
requirement_1
component_3
in
a
traditional
component_1
you
might
consider
use
quality_attribute_2
transaction
a
k
a
two
phase
connector_1
2pc
however
use
2pc
be
generally
a
bad
idea
a
pattern_1
architecture
itâs
a
form
of
pattern_3
connector_2
that
connector_data_4
in
runtime
couple
that
significantly
impact
the
quality_attribute_3
of
an
component_1
what
be
a
saga
the
solution
be
to
connector_3
command
such
a
createorder
use
a
saga
a
saga
be
a
sequence
of
local
transaction
in
each
of
the
participate
component_3
for
example
here
be
the
definition
of
the
create
order
saga
which
be
initiate
by
the
createorder
command
step
participant
transaction
compensate
transaction
order
component_3
creatependingorder
rejectorder
requirement_1
component_3
reservecredit
order
component_3
approveorder
the
purpose
of
each
step
be
a
follow
creatependingorder
create
the
order
in
a
pending
state
reservecredit
attempt
to
reserve
credit
approveorder
connector_4
the
state
of
the
order
to
approve
rejectorder
connector_4
the
state
of
the
order
to
reject
the
sequence
for
the
happy
path
be
a
follow
order
component_3
creatependingorder
requirement_1
component_3
reservecredit
order
component_3
approveorder
the
sequence
for
the
path
when
there
be
insufficient
credit
be
a
follow
order
component_3
creatependingorder
requirement_1
component_3
reservecredit
order
component_3
rejectorder
what
be
compensate
transaction
the
rejectorder
command
be
an
example
of
a
compensate
transaction
unlike
acid
transaction
saga
cannot
automatically
undo
connector_5
make
by
previous
step
since
those
connector_5
be
already
connector_1
instead
you
must
connector_6
compensate
transaction
that
explicitly
undo
those
connector_4
each
step
of
a
saga
that
be
follow
by
a
step
that
can
fail
for
requirement_2
reason
must
have
a
correspond
compensate
transaction
in
the
create
order
saga
createorder
have
the
rejectorder
compensate
transaction
because
the
reservecredit
step
can
fail
the
reservecredit
step
do
not
need
a
compensate
transaction
because
the
approveorder
step
cannot
fail
and
the
approveorder
step
do
not
need
a
compensate
transaction
because
itâs
the
last
step
of
the
saga
what
be
the
semantic
lock
counter
measure
you
might
be
wonder
why
createorder
create
the
order
in
a
pending
state
which
be
then
connector_4
to
approve
by
approveorder
the
use
of
a
pending
state
be
an
example
of
what
be
a
a
semantic
lock
counter
measure
it
prevent
another
transaction
saga
from
update
the
order
while
it
be
in
the
component_4
of
be
create
to
see
why
this
be
necessary
consider
the
follow
scenario
where
the
cancelorder
command
be
invoke
while
the
order
be
still
be
create
create
order
saga
cancel
order
saga
createorder
state=created
â
â
cancelorder
state=cancelled
reservecredit
â
approveobject
state=approved
â
in
this
scenario
the
cancelorder
command
connector_5
the
status
of
the
order
to
cancel
and
the
approveorder
command
overwrite
that
connector_4
by
set
the
status
to
approve
the
requirement_1
would
be
quite
surprise
when
the
order
be
connector_7
the
pending
state
prevent
this
problem
the
cancelorder
command
will
only
cancel
an
order
if
it
state
be
approve
if
the
state
be
pending
cancelorder
an
error
to
the
component_5
indicate
that
it
should
try
again
late
the
semantic
lock
counter
measure
be
a
kind
of
component_1
level
lock
a
i
describe

the
presentation
itâs
a
way
to
make
saga
