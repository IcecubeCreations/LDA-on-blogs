someone
ask
me
if
it
be
possible
to
quality_attribute_2
technology_3
with
other
component_3
the
connector_1
be
yes
but
we
have
to
analyze
which
be
the
best
pattern_3
to
use
and
which
kind
of
requirement_1
be
need
we
can
use
pattern_4
pattern_3
or
online
component_4
quality_attribute_3
on
the
volume
and
time
impact
imagine
for
example
that
you
be
use
technology_3
a
crm
and
you
have
an
erp
for
manage
contract
order
etc
the
crm
by
definition
be
the
master
of
account
and
instead
the
erp
manage
contract
order
logistics
etc
s
focus
on
requirement_1
from
technology_3
to
erp
identify
the
correct
pattern_3
seem
pretty
easy
the
connector_data_1
exchange
must
be
in
real
time
the
reason
be
that
to
complete
an
order
or
a
contract
you
need
the
account
and
probably
an
component_5
rest
be
what
be
right
for
u
yes
it
could
be
a
solution
but
be
this
the
best
solution
in
my
opinion
no
we
can
take
advantage
of
technology_3
connector_4
connector_data_1
capture
cdc
and
technology_1
technology_2
integrator
who
work
with
technology_3
that
an
requirement_1
pattern_5
be
often
require
and
technology_2
be
a
very
useful
technology_5
because
it
offer
a
connector
for
technology_3
out
of
the
component_6
in
tinext
we
have
create
an
requirement_1
hub
connector_5
tihub
base
on
technology_1
technology_2
to
standardize
simplify
and
quality_attribute_4
up
the
requirement_1
between
technology_3
and
other
component_3
we
have
optimize
the
requirement_1
pattern_3
and
for
this
particular
scenario
we
have
decide
to
use
cdc
and
connector_6
component_5
to
propagate
the
creation
of
account
and
from
technology_3
to
erp
connector_4
connector_data_1
capture
publish
connector_4
that
represent
connector_7
to
technology_3
component_7
connector_7
include
create
a
component_7
update
a
component_7
delete
a
component_7
and
undeleting
a
component_7
the
technology_2
technology_3
component_8
can
technology_6
to
such
connector_data_2
allow
u
to
synchronize
those
connector_7
into
our
erp
the
connector_data_2
of
interest
could
be
specify
in
the
from
technology_3
xxx
clause
of
a
technology_2
connector_8
via
the

connector_8
with
tihub
we
develop
a
set
of
able
to
insert
a
component_7
dynamically
in
one
component_2
in
this
scenario
we
assume
to
use
one
of
these
to
component_10
only
name
connector_9
by
cdc
directly
in
a
stag
area
of
our
erp
if
not
enough
and
you
be
deal
with
more
complex
scenario
you
could
make
use
of
the
active_mq
component_11
to
connector_2
the
and
dispatch
it
to
all
pattern_7
connector_data_3
xxxxxxxxxx

for

you
can
use

the
second
one
with
the
component_2
etc
erp
to
technology_3
be
not
part
of
this
document
but
probably
the
crm
need
order
and
contract
for
report
consequently
the
connector_data_4
could
be
propagate
