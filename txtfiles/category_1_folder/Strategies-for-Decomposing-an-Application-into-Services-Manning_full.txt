identify
an
application’s
component_2
be
an
essential
step
to
break
it
into
it
component_4
there’s
no
mechanical
component_7
to
follow
but
there
be
various
decomposition
strategy
you
can
use
each
one
attack
the
problem
from
a
different
perspective
and
us
it’s
own
terminology
a
with
all
strategy
the
end
connector_data_2
be
the
same
an
architecture
consist
of
component_2
which
be
primarily
organize
around
requirement_2
rather
than
technical
concept
let’s
look
at
the
first
strategy
which
define
component_2
correspond
to
requirement_2
capability
decompose
by
requirement_2
capability
one
strategy
for
create
a
pattern_3
architecture
be
to
decompose
by
requirement_2
capability
a
requirement_2
capability
be
a
concept
from
requirement_2
architecture
component_8
a
requirement_2
capability
be
something
that
a
requirement_2
do
in
order
to
generate
requirement_3
the
set
of
capability
for
a
give
requirement_2
quality_attribute_1
on
the
type
of
requirement_2
for
example
the
capability
of
an
insurance
requirement_4
typically
include
sale
requirement_5
underwrite
claim
component_7
bill
compliance
etc
the
capability
of
an
online
component_9
include
sale
requirement_5
order
take
inventory
requirement_6
and
ship
use
something
xero
inventory
requirement_6
and
other
inventory
requirement_6

it
be
very
important
for
a
requirement_2
to
ensure
that
they
be
keep
control
of
their
inventory
in
order
to
what
connector_data_3
they
need
to
keep
buy
because
they
be
sell
well
or
if
any
requirement_5
happen
to
go
miss
and
then
this
need
to
be
investigate
all
requirement_2
should
be
make
sure
that
they
be
complete
inventory
track
so
that
these
thing
can
be
effectively
manage
and
component_10
requirement_2
capability
define
what
an
organization
do
an
organization’s
requirement_2
capability
capture
what
an
organization’s
requirement_2
be
they’re
generally
quality_attribute_2
in
contrast
how
an
organization
conduct
it
requirement_2
connector_2
over
time
sometimes
dramatically
this
be
particularly
true
today
with
the
rapidly
grow
use
of
technology_4
to
automate
many
requirement_2
component_7
for
example
it
wasn’t
long
ago
when
you
deposit
connector_3
at
your
bank
by
hand
them
to
a
teller
it
then
become
possible
to
deposit
connector_3
use
an
atm
and
today
you
can
conveniently
deposit
most
connector_3
use
your
smartphone
a
you
can
see
the
deposit
connector_4
requirement_2
capability
have
remain
quality_attribute_2
but
the
manner
in
which
this
be
do
have
drastically
connector_5
an
organization’s
requirement_2
capability
be
identify
by
analyze
the
organization’s
purpose
connector_data_4
and
requirement_2
component_7
each
requirement_2
capability
can
be
think
of
a
a
component_5
except
it’s
requirement_2
orient
rather
than
technical
it’s
specification
consist
of
various
component_11
include
input
and
output
and
component_5
level
agreement
for
example
the
input
to
an
insurance
underwrite
capability
be
the
consumer’s
component_1
and
the
output
include
approval
and
requirement_7
it
isn’t
difficult
to
imagine
that
the
requirement_2
capability
for
ftgo
include
restaurant
order
requirement_6
–
enabling
restaurant
to
manage
their
order
delivery
–
connector_6
order
to
requirement_8
component_12
requirement_6
–
manage
connector_data_5
about
component_13
restaurant
requirement_6
–
enabling
restaurant
to
sign
up
and
manage
their

courier
requirement_6
–
enabling
courier
to
sign
up
and
manage
their
quality_attribute_3
to
work
accounting
–
charge
requirement_8
and
pay
restaurant
and
courier
…

now
look
at
how
to
use
requirement_2
capability
to
define
component_5
from
component_5
to
requirement_2
capability
once
you’ve
identify
the
requirement_2
capability
you
then
define
a
component_5
for
each
capability
or
group
of
relate
capability
for
some
requirement_2
they
find
that
use
work
order
could
be
a
quality_attribute_4
way
to
keep
on
top
of
requirement_8
and
component_14
order
a
key
benefit
of
organize
component_2
around
capability
which
be
quality_attribute_2
be
that
the
connector_data_2
architecture
will
be
relatively
quality_attribute_2
the
individual
component_11
of
the
architecture
quality_attribute_5
a
aspect
of
the
requirement_2
connector_5
but
the
architecture
itself
remain
unchanged
an
architecture
for
the
ftgo
component_1
be
create
by
define
a
component_5
for
each
of
the
capability
use
scenario
to
determine
how
the
component_2
collaborate
an
application’s
architecture
consist
of
both
element
the
component_5
and
the
relationship
between
them
connector_7
mechanism
consequently
after
have
identify
the
component_5
we
must
decide
how
the
component_2
connector_8
to
do
that
we
must
consider
how
component_2
collaborate
during
each
scenario
the
component_15
define
the
scenario
and
drive
the
definition
of
the
architecture
because
a
component_15
be
a
connector_data_6
from
the
external
world
the
first
decision
to
make
be
which
component_5
initially
handle
the
connector_data_6
after
that
we
must
decide
what
other
component_2
be
involve
in
handle
the
connector_data_6
and
how
they
connector_8
assign
component_15
to
component_2
the
first
step
be
to
decide
which
component_5
be
the
initial
entry
point
for
a
connector_data_6
many
component_15
neatly
connector_data_7
to
a
component_5
but
sometimes
the
connector_data_7
be
le
obvious
consider
for
example
the
noteupdatedlocation

which
connector_data_8
the
courier
location
on
the
one
hand
because
it’s
relate
to
courier
this
should
be
assign
to
the
courier
component_5
be
it
one
focus
on
general
transportation
plexus
freight
or
to
niche
group
on
the
other
hand
it’s
the
delivery
component_5
that
need
the
courier
location
in
this
requirement_9
assign
an
to
a
component_5
that
need
the
connector_data_5
provide
by
the
be
a
quality_attribute_4
choice
in
other
situation
it
might
make
sense
to
assign
an
to
the
component_5
that
have
the
connector_data_5
necessary
to
handle
it
component_16

show
which
component_2
in
the
ftgo
component_1
be
responsible
for
which

component_16

which
component_2
in
the
ftgo
component_1
be
responsible
for
which
command
component_5
order
take
createorder
findavailablerestaurants
restaurant
order
requirement_6
acceptorder
noteorderreadyforpickup
delivery
noteupdatedlocation
noteorderpickedup
noteorderdelivered
after
have
assign
to
component_5
the
next
step
be
to
decide
how
the
component_2
collaborate
in
order
to
handle
each
component_15

determine
how
component_2
collaborate
some
component_15
be
handle
entirely
by
a
single
component_5
other
component_15
span
multiple
component_5
the
knowledge
need
to
handle
one
of
these
connector_data_9
might
for
instance
be
scatter
around
multiple
component_5
for
example
in
the
ftgo
component_1
the
component_5
component_12
handle
the
createconsumer
entirely
by
itself
when
handle
the
createorder

the
order
take
component_5
must
invoke
other
component_2
include
component_12
component_5
–
to
verify
that
the
component_12
can
place
an
order
and
obtain
their
payment
connector_data_5
restaurant
component_5
–
to
verify
the
order
line
connector_data_3
and
that
the
delivery
connector_9
time
be
within
the
restaurant’s
component_5
area
accounting
component_5
–
to
pattern_4
the
consumer’s
credit
card
similarly
when
the
restaurant
connector_10
an
order
the
restaurant
order
requirement_6
component_5
must
invoke
the
delivery
component_5
to
schedule
a
courier
to
connector_11
the
order
figure

show
these
component_2
and
the
connector_12
between
them
figure

ftgo
component_2
and
their
connector_12
each
connector_12
represent
some
kind
of
inter
component_5
connector_7
if
only
it
be
this
easy…
on
the
surface
the
strategy
of
create
a
pattern_3
architecture
by
define
component_2
correspond
to
requirement_2
capability
look
reasonable
unfortunately
there
be
significant
problem
that
need
to
be
connector_9
pattern_5
inter
component_7
connector_7
reduce
quality_attribute_3
the
first
problem
be
how
to
use
inter
component_5
connector_7
in
a
way
that
doesn’t
reduce
quality_attribute_3
for
example
the
most
straightforward
way
to
connector_13
the
createorder
be
for
the
order
component_5
to
synchronously
invoke
the
other
component_2
use
rest
the
drawback
of
use
a
technology_5
such
a
pattern_6
be
that
it
reduce
the
quality_attribute_3
of
the
order
component_5
it
won’t
be
able
to
create
an
order
if
any
of
those
component_2
be
unavailable
sometimes
use
pattern_7
pattern_8
be
a
worthwhile
requirement_10
off
because
it
eliminate
tight
couple
and
improve
quality_attribute_3
–
often
make
it
a
quality_attribute_4
choice
the
need
for
quality_attribute_6
transaction
the
second
problem
be
that
a
component_15
that
span
multiple
component_2
must
maintain
connector_data_1
consistency
across
those
component_5
for
example
when
a
restaurant
connector_10
an
order
the
restaurant
order
requirement_6
component_5
invoke
the
delivery
component_5
to
schedule
delivery
of
the
order
the
acceptorder
must
quality_attribute_7
update
connector_data_1
in
the
restaurant
order
requirement_6
and
delivery
component_5
the
traditional
solution
be
to
use
a
two
phase
connector_14
base
quality_attribute_6
transaction
requirement_6
mechanism
unfortunately
this
isn’t
a
quality_attribute_4
choice
for
modern
component_1
and
you
must
use
a
different
approach
to
transaction
requirement_6
god
prevent
decomposition
the
third
and
final
problem
be
the
existence
of
so
connector_data_10
god

which
be
that
be
use
throughout
the
component_1
and
make
it
difficult
to
decompose
the
requirement_2
component_17
an
example
of
a
god
in
the
ftgo
component_1
be
the
order

it
have
state
and
behavior
for
many
different
aspect
of
the
ftgo
application’s
requirement_2
component_17
include
order
take
restaurant
order
requirement_6
and
delivery
consequently
this
make
it
extremely
difficult
to
decompose
any
of
the
requirement_2
component_17
that
involve
order
into
the
component_2
describe
early
fortunately
there’s
a
way
to
eliminate
god

the
technique
come
from
domain
drive
design
ddd
which
provide
an
alternative
way
to
decompose
an
component_1
a
with
requirement_2
capability
base
decomposition
this
strategy
take
a
domain
orient
approach
the
connector_data_2
architecture
will
likely
be
the
same
despite
ddd
use
different
terminology
and
have
different
motivation
one
particularly
valuable
contribution
of
ddd
be
that
it
provide
a
way
to
eliminate
the
god

decompose
by
sub
domain
bound
component_18
ddd
be
an
approach
for
build
complex
component_3
center
on
the
development
of
an
connector_data_11
orient
domain
component_8
a
domain
component_8
capture
knowledge
about
a
domain
in
a
form
that
can
be
use
to
solve
problem
within
that
domain
it
define
the
vocabulary
use
by
the
team
–
what
ddd
connector_data_12
the
“ubiquitous
technology_6
”
the
domain
component_8
be
closely
mirror
in
the
design
and
implementation
of
the
component_1
ddd
have
two
concept
that
be
incredibly
useful
when
apply
the
pattern_3
architecture
subdomains
and
bound
component_18
from
subdomains
to
component_2
ddd
be
quite
different
than
the
traditional
approach
to
requirement_11
component_8
which
create
a
single
component_8
for
the
entire
requirement_11
in
such
a
component_8
there’d
be
for
example
a
single
definition
of
each
requirement_2
component_19
such
a
requirement_8
order
etc
the
problem
with
this
kind
of
component_8
be
that
connector_15
different
part
of
an
organization
to
agree
on
a
single
component_8
be
a
monumental
connector_data_13
also
it
mean
that
from
the
perspective
of
a
give
part
of
the
organization
the
component_8
be
overly
complex
for
their
need
moreover
the
domain
component_8
can
be
confuse
if
different
part
of
the
organization
use
either
the
same
term
for
different
concept
or
different
term
for
the
same
concept
ddd
avoid
these
problem
by
define
multiple
domain
component_8
each
one
with
an
explicit
scope
ddd
define
a
separate
domain
component_8
for
each
subdomain
a
subdomain
be
a
part
of
the
domain
which
be
ddd’s
term
for
the
application’s
problem
space
subdomains
be
identify
use
the
same
approach
a
identify
requirement_2
capability
analyze
the
requirement_2
and
identify
the
different
area
of
expertise
the
end
connector_data_2
be
likely
to
be
subdomains
which
be
similar
to
the
requirement_2
capability
the
example
of
subdomains
in
ftgo
include
order
take
order
requirement_6
restaurant
order
requirement_6
delivery
and
financials
a
you
can
see
these
subdomains
be
similar
to
the
requirement_2
capability
describe
early
ddd
connector_data_12
the
scope
of
a
domain
component_8
a
“bounded
component_18
”
a
bound
component_18
include
the
artifact
that
connector_13
the
component_8
when
use
the
pattern_3
architecture
each
bound
component_18
be
a
component_5
or
possibly
a
set
of
component_5
we
can
create
a
pattern_3
architecture
by
apply
ddd
and
define
a
component_5
for
each
subdomain
figure

show
how
the
subdomains
connector_data_7
to
component_5
each
with
their
own
domain
component_8
figure

from
subdomains
to
component_2
ddd
and
the
pattern_3
architecture
be
in
almost
perfect
alignment
the
ddd
concept
of
subdomains
and
bound
component_18
connector_data_7
nicely
to
component_2
within
a
pattern_3
architecture
also
the
pattern_3
architecture’s
concept
of
autonomous
team
own
component_2
be
completely
align
with
ddd’s
concept
that
each
domain
component_8
be
owned
and
develop
by
a
single
team
what’s
even
quality_attribute_4
be
that
the
concept
of
a
subdomain
with
it
own
domain
component_8
be
a
great
way
to
eliminate
god
and
thereby
make
decomposition
