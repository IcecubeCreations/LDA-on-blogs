i

technology_3
relevant
to
industrial
iot
i
will
begin
with

to
simplify
my
own
understand
the
sheer

in
the
entire

journey
from

to

be
overwhelm
and
hence
this
be
an
attempt
to
simplify
a
brief
comparison
between
the
old

*etl

connector_data_1
component_4
into
requirement_6
connector_data_1
requirement_7
and
requirement_8
be
do
use
pattern_1
technology_6
the
challenge
of
previous
pipeline
be
that
the
connector_data_1
be
pattern_2
that
be
it
could
be
neatly
represent

but
it
could
not

the
other
challenge
be
the
quality_attribute_1
and
quality_attribute_2
of
component_1
with
requirement_4
today
the
world
have
connector_3
profoundly
the
variety
of
connector_data_1
component_4
have
multiply
from
component_5
to
component_6
to

to
connector_4
and
connector_data_2
component_7
today
the
connector_data_1
connector_5
have
multiply
too
—
from

to

how

how
