there
be
some
difference
but
the
technology_21
technology_6
use
for
each
type
of
component_20
be
rather
similar
presto
presto
be
an
open_source
quality_attribute_5
technology_21
query
component_15
for
requirement_1
for
run
connector_5
on
large
quality_attribute_9
component_19
with
gigabyte
to
petabyte
of
connector_data_1
presto
can
connector_15
with
multiple
connector_data_1
component_9
include
technology_20
technology_38
relational
component_19
or
even
proprietary
connector_data_1
component_8
a
neat
feature
be
that
component_17
be
able
to
combine
connector_data_1
from
multiple
component_23
use
a
single
presto
query
technology_39
the
opposite
of
technology_10
technology_39
component_19
component_8
connector_data_1
for
the
most
part
in
a
non
pattern_2
manner
with
unique
way
of
connector_11
with
it
technology_39
component_19
be
increasingly
use
for
requirement_1
some
example
of
technology_39
style
component_19
be
key
requirement_12
column
base
and
graph
base
component_19
there
be
also
document
base
component_19
which
component_8
semi
pattern_2
connector_data_1
a
popular
document
base
component_19
be
technology_40
which
connector_16
connector_data_2
a
a
technology_41

there
be
two
edition

with
one
of
them
freely
quality_attribute_3
a
part
of
the

technology_15
superset
technology_15
superset
be
a
requirement_2
intelligence
web
component_11
that
can
be
use
for
connector_data_1
exploration
and
connector_data_1
visualization
superset
be
originally
develop
by
airbnb
and
they
late
make
it
quality_attribute_3
to
the

it
can
work
well
with
various

etc
and
component_26
newrelic
statsd
and
datadog
superset
also
have
the
ability
to
run
requirement_3
against
most
popular
component_19
technology_48
it
be
connector_4
in
technology_8
so
technology_8
be
need
to
work
with
it
technology_15
zeppelin
technology_15
zeppelin
be
an
open_source

for

connector_data_1
analysis
and
exploration
visualization
of
large
quality_attribute_9

zeppelin
quality_attribute_11
with
other
technology_14
technology_15
technology_23
and
technology_15
flink
technology_15

allow
