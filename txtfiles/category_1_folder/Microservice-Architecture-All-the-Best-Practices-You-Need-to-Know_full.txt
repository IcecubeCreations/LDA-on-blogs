probably
the

for

for
the
technology_23
david
dawson‚Äôs
suggestion
for
select
technology_1
from
a
connector_data_1
architecture
point
of
pattern_9
you
need
something
that
can
provide
connector_data_1
you
can
easily
synchronise
into
some
consistently
quality_attribute_17
state
across
a
requirement_2
between
component_7
there
be
a
variety
of
approach
for
that
which
be
what
i‚Äôm
actually
look
for
in
my
pattern_1
deployment
so
you
can
observe
the
various
technology_13
and
technology_1
for
connector_16
these
kind
of
pattern_7
this
be
where
tech
such
a
technology_24
technology_25
connector_data_1
flow
technology_26
and
friend
sit
once
we
have
decide
on
these
pattern_7
and
approach
you
then
mesh
that
with
what
resource
you
have
quality_attribute_18
if
you
have
decide
on
a
connector_data_1
flow
approach
with
lot
of
reactive
programming
and
you
already
have
technology_9
devs
then
it
make
sense
to
pick
technology_25
technology_25
requirement_1
connector_data_1
flow
and
technology_24
and
probably
to
quality_attribute_7
onto
some
form
of
requirement_1
foundry
if
you
can
connector_10
it
if
you
need
lot
of
heavy
connector_data_1
transform
bring
in
technology_27
or
technology_24
connector_17
to
help
with
that
if
you
have
technology_12
developer
then
that
would
not
make
sense
instead
you
would
look
to
adopt
some
functional
technology_4
on
the
technology_28
runtime
technology_29
etc
again
use
some
similar
reactive
requirement_8
tech
technology_24
be
certainly
make
wave
in
this
space
and
take
it
from
there
key
takeaway
do
not
stress
about
select
the
perfect
technology_1
take
an
iterative
experimental
approach
instead
every
pattern_1
architecture
be
unique
the
selected
technology_1
should
be
align
with
the
system‚Äôs
need
keep
in
mind
that
too
many
different
technology_1
make
hire
more
complicate
conclusion
when
it
come
to
switch
to
a
pattern_1
architecture
there
be
many
challenge
before
you
start
transform
your
component_1
into
pattern_2
make
sure
to
have
real
reason
why
you
want
to
do
it
go
through
the
advantage
and
disadvantage
could
be
a
big
help
instead
of
follow
the
late
hype
you
need
to
consider
the
unique
feature
of
your
component_1
first
and
only
connector_2
the
part
of
the
component_1
that
hurt
the
most
start
with
a
pattern_1
architecture
from
scratch
isn‚Äôt
recommend
since
clearly
define
the
boundary
of
a
pattern_1
at
the
begin
be
difficult
if
you
decide
to
switch
to
a
pattern_1
architecture
take
an
incremental
approach
and
take
out
a
small
non
critical
part
of
your
