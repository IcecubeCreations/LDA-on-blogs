about

decompose
by
requirement_1
capability
component_1
you
be
develop
a
large
complex
component_2
and
want
to
use
the
pattern_1
architecture
the
pattern_1
architecture
connector_data_1
an
component_2
a
a
set
of
loosely
couple
component_3
the
goal
of
the
pattern_1
architecture
be
to
accelerate
development
by
enabling
continuous
delivery
deployment
the
pattern_1
architecture
do
this
in
two
way
simplify
test
and
enable
component_4
to
quality_attribute_1
independently
connector_data_1
the
engineering
organization
a
a
collection
of
small
member
autonomous
team
each
of
which
be
responsible
for
one
or
more
component_5
these
benefit
be
not
automatically
guarantee
instead
they
can
only
be
achieve
by
the
careful
functional
decomposition
of
the
component_2
into
component_3
a
component_3
must
be
small
enough
to
be
develop
by
a
small
team
and
to
be
easily
test
a
useful
guideline
from
connector_data_2
orient
design
ood
be
the
single
responsibility
principle
srp
the
srp
define
a
responsibility
of
a
a
a
reason
to
connector_1
and
state
that
a
should
only
have
one
reason
to
connector_1
it
make
sense
to
apply
the
srp
to
component_3
design
a
well
and
design
component_5
that
be
cohesive
and
connector_2
a
small
set
of
strongly
relate
the
component_2
also
be
decompose
in
a
way
so
that
most
and
connector_1
requirement
only
affect
a
single
component_3
that
be
because
connector_3
that
affect
multiple
component_5
require
coordination
across
multiple
team
which
slow
down
development
another
useful
principle
from
ood
be
the
common
closure
principle
ccp
which
state
that
that
connector_1
for
the
same
reason
should
be
in
the
same
package
perhaps
for
instance
two
connector_2
different
aspect
of
the
same
requirement_1
rule
the
goal
be
that
when
that
requirement_1
rule
connector_3
developer
only
need
to
connector_1
in
a
small
number
ideally
only
one
of
package
this
kind
of
think
make
sense
when
design
component_5
since
it
will
help
ensure
that
each
connector_1
should
impact
only
one
component_3
problem
how
to
decompose
an
component_2
into
component_3
force
the
architecture
must
be
quality_attribute_2
component_5
must
be
cohesive
a
component_3
should
connector_2
a
small
set
of
strongly
relate
component_5
must
conform
to
the
common
closure
principle
thing
that
connector_1
together
should
be
packaged
together
to
ensure
that
each
connector_1
affect
only
one
component_3
component_5
must
be
loosely
couple
each
component_3
a
an
component_6
that
pattern_3
it
implementation
the
implementation
can
be
connector_1
without
affect
component_7
a
component_3
should
be
quality_attribute_3
each
component_3
be
small
enough
to
be
develop
by
a
“two
pizza”
team
i
e
a
team
of
people
each
team
that
own
one
or
more
component_5
must
be
autonomous
a
team
must
be
able
to
develop
and
quality_attribute_1
their
component_5
with
minimal
collaboration
with
other
team
solution
define
component_5
correspond
to
requirement_1
capability
a
requirement_1
capability
be
a
concept
from
requirement_1
architecture
component_8
it
be
something
that
a
requirement_1
do
in
order
to
generate
requirement_2
a
requirement_1
capability
often
correspond
to
a
requirement_1
connector_data_2
e
g
order
requirement_3
be
responsible
for
order
requirement_4
requirement_3
be
responsible
for
requirement_4
requirement_1
capability
be
often
organize
into
a
multi
level
hierarchy
for
example
an
requirement_5
component_2
might
have
top
level
category
such
a
technology_2
component_3
development
technology_2
component_3
delivery
demand
generation
etc
example
the
requirement_1
capability
of
an
online
component_9
include
technology_2
catalog
requirement_3
inventory
requirement_3
order
requirement_3
delivery
requirement_3
…
the
correspond
pattern_1
architecture
would
have
component_5
correspond
to
each
of
these
capability
connector_data_3
component_1
this
pattern_2
have
the
follow
benefit
quality_attribute_2
architecture
since
the
requirement_1
capability
be
relatively
quality_attribute_2
development
team
be
cross
functional
autonomous
and
organize
around
connector_4
requirement_1
requirement_2
rather
than
technical
feature
component_5
be
cohesive
and
loosely
couple
issue
there
be
the
follow
issue
to
connector_5
how
to
identify
requirement_1
capability
identify
requirement_1
capability
and
hence
component_5
require
