introduction
to
technology_1
alternative
in
this
we
will
discus
technology_1
alternative
the
technology_2
technology_1
be
a
quality_attribute_1
connector_1
component_1
that
be
originally
develop
by
linkedin
and
then
donate
to
technology_2
foundation
which
also
own
technology_2
technology_3
and
technology_2
technology_4
among
others
under
it
foundation
technology_1
basically
be
an
open
component_2
connector_2
component_3
component_1
connector_3
in
technology_5
and
technology_6
which
be
use
to
handle
connector_data_1
fee
in
real
time
provide
a
unify
low
quality_attribute_2
and
high
quality_attribute_3
component_1
a
connector_1
component_1
basically
have
three
major
role
viz
publish
and
subscribe
to
connector_4
of
component_4
a
they
occur
in
real
time
component_5
them
and
component_3
them
in
real
time
a
they
occur
technology_1
have
a
basic
connector_data_2
of
a
component_6
technology_1
cluster
connector_2
processor
and
connector
and
component_7
quality_attribute_1
requirement_1
technology_7
seem
similar
to
traditional
pattern_1
pattern_2
pattern_3
however
they
differ
significantly
architecturally
and
have
vary
and
complex
use
requirement_2
scenario
that
differentiate
various
component_8
however
due
to
some
inherent
disadvantage
issue
with
connector_data_3
tweak
lack
of
pace
and
lack
some
connector_data_3
paradigm
among
others
it
become
increasingly
important
to
be
aware
of
some
alternative
to
technology_2
technology_1
rait
mq
aws’s
kinesis
azure’s
hub
etc
and
in
this
we’ll
briefly
discus
some
of
them
and
their
feature
and
advantage
over
technology_2
technology_1
start
your
free
connector_data_1
science
technology_3
connector_data_1
science
statistic
&
others
alternative
of
technology_1
below
be
the
connector_data_4
of
top
rank
alternative
of
technology_1
kinesis
technology_8
kinesis
or
kinesis
connector_4
be
consider
to
be
base
on
technology_1
kinesis
be
for
it
super
fast
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_5
ease
of
and
it
cross
component_1
pattern_4
ability
cross
component_1
pattern_4
be
pattern_5
of
connector_data_1
between
physical
and
logical
connector_data_1
centre
there
be
also
many
technology_9
specific
component_9
technology_6
technology_10
ruy
technology_11
technology_12
etc
one
of
kafka’s
major
flaw
be
the
need
for
human
intervention
to
install
and
maintain
the
connector_2
however
kinesis
break
the
connector_4
across
shard
which
be
similar
to
component_10
in
technology_1
and
each
shard
have
a
hard
limit
on
the
number
of
transaction
and
connector_data_1
volume
per
second
you’ll
need
to
increase
the
number
of
shard
if
you
exceed
that
limit
this
be
where
kinesis
distinguish
where
technology_8
allow
component_11
to
increase
or
quality_attribute_6
their
by
only
pay
for
what
they
use
and
thus
much
of
the
quality_attribute_7
be
hide
from
the
component_12
however
technology_1
be
more
quality_attribute_8
and
can
be
accustomed
to
what
component_11
need
however
the
component_12
need
to
manage
it
own
cluster
and
require
devops
resource
to
keep
it
run
on
the
other
hand
kinesis
be
sell
a
a
component_13
by
web
component_14
and
doesn’t
need
a
devops
team
to
run
it
kinesis
be
more
useful
for
requirement_3
requirement_4
ticker
social
requirement_5
connector_data_1
although
linkedin
be
entirely
run
on
technology_1
for
connector_1
connector_data_1
geospatial
connector_data_1
connector_5
component_12
component_11
with
driver
and
with
iot
sensor
choose
between
the
two
again
quality_attribute_9
on
the
use
requirement_2
and
volume
of
connector_data_1
however
kinesis
be
a
quality_attribute_10
place
to
start
due
to
it
quality_attribute_4
and
cost
advantage
a
discus
some
of
the
requirement_6
use
technology_8
kinesis
be
intuit
accenture
netflix
lyft
and
500px
raitmq
it
be
a
traditional
connector_data_3
pattern_1
and
one
of
the
first
open
component_2
connector_data_3
pattern_1
to
have
reasonable
feature
it
be
originally
develop
to
connector_6
the
technology_13
technology_14
which
be
use
for
it
powerful
connector_7
feature
with
the
advent
of
the
technology_13
technology_14
cross
technology_9
quality_attribute_11
become
possible
for
open_source
connector_data_3
pattern_1
it
u
the
smart
pattern_1
dum
component_7
approach
to
connector_8
connector_data_5
to
component_15
consistently
it
be
mature
and
perform
well
if
configure
correctly
and
have
a
well
support
connector_data_4
of
technology_15
technology_6
net
technology_12
j
ruy
technology_16
and
others
along
with
countless
plugins
quality_attribute_12
although
technology_1
have
some
advantage
it
include
the
pattern_1
in
the
component_8
and
thus
work
effortlessly
with
connector_4
component_3
rait
mq
be
use
it
be
use
when
the
component_8
need
to
work
on
various
technology_14
technology_17
stomp
technology_18
suppose
you
need
a
more
detail
control
on
a
per
connector_data_3
basis
mean
where
the
connector_data_1
volume
be
le
and
the
component_12
need
more
control
over
it
however
technology_1
have
support
for
more
control
recently
the
component_8
need
more
quality_attribute_11
in
point
to
point
connector_data_6
connector_data_7
connector_data_3
to
quality_attribute_13
multiple
component_13
component_16
with
non
trivial
connector_7
component_17
if
you
need
more
quality_attribute_14
over
component_8
a
it
provide
support
for
plugins
and
component_18
for
the
same
also
it
have
quality_attribute_10
support
through
various
plugins
quality_attribute_12
for
almost
all
possible
scenario
some
of
the
requirement_6
use
technology_19
be
reddit
9gag
robinhood
zapier
myntra
and
mit
technology_20
although
both
technology_1
and
technology_20
be
originally
make
for
different
completely
they’ve
have
many
feature
that
overlay
each
other
over
time
therefore
they’re
be
use
interchangeably
and
often
use
for
the
same
purpose
and
compare
with
each
other
technology_20
be
a
general
purpose
connector_data_3
pattern_1
raitmq
that
support
several
pattern_2
technology_14
technology_17
stomp
and
technology_18
where
it
slightly
distinguish
itself
be
the
quality_attribute_10
support
for
requirement_7
requirement_8
pattern_6
therefore
in
general
it
be
use
for
requirement_8
between
component_19
or
component_13
some
of
the
key
difference
be
allow
component_19
build
with
different
technology_9
and
on
different
operate
component_20
to
quality_attribute_13
with
each
other
technology_1
component_6
doesn’t
wait
for
the
broker’s
acknowledgement
increasing
the
overall
quality_attribute_3
if
the
pattern_1
can
handle
connector_data_5
a
fast
a
the
component_6
connector_9
them
technology_20
have
to
keep
and
maintain
a
delivery
report
of
every
connector_data_3
at
every
state
thus
it
have
great
recovery
support
where
connector_data_5
can
be
restore
late
if
a
component_21
fail
technology_1
also
have
a
quality_attribute_10
storage
quality_attribute_15
a
in
technology_1
each
connector_data_3
have
an
overhead
of
byte
against
that
of
byte
in
technology_21
this
increase
the
space
use
by
technology_20
by
70%
more
than
technology_1
technology_20
also
connector_10
connector_data_5
to
component_15
instead
of
component_15
have
to
pattern_7
for
connector_data_5
by
do
a
technology_22
query
which
reduce
the
quality_attribute_2
involve
in
component_3
connector_data_3
it
also
have
a
great
and
rousts
scheduler
which
mean
you
can
schedule
connector_data_5
to
be
connector_8
at
a
particular
time
some
of
the
requirement_6
use
technology_20
be
intuit

quality_attribute_6
quality_attribute_1
connector_data_1

connector_data_1
component_3
it
have
technology_15
for
technology_24
ml
graph
computation
and
connector_2
component_3
so
it
offer
much
more
than
technology_1
which
only
provide
connector_2

at
it
core
technology_23
component_23
connector_data_1
connector_4
in

generate
make
it
one
of
the
fast
amongst

and
thereby
increasingly
have
use
requirement_2
in
financial
requirement_3
also
a
connector_data_1
connector_4
grow
and
it’s
grow
at
an
exponential
rate
their
ml
capability
become
more
feasible
and
quality_attribute_16
it’s
also
easy
to

and
doesn’t
require

connector_data_1
it
also
have
an
interactive
requirement_9
component_22
enabling
component_11
to
have
engagingly
project
connector_data_1
however
many
people
would
still
prefer
technology_1
or
quality_attribute_10
technology_1
connector_4
for
it
relatively
quality_attribute_17
approach
and
thereby
technology_23
be

technology_2
technology_25
the
storm
be
more
in
line
with
technology_23
a
it
be
primarily
in
connector_data_1
it’s
an
open_source
quality_attribute_1
realtime
computation
component_24
for
connector_data_1
connector_4
similar
to
what
technology_3
do
for
a

it
also
quality_attribute_13
with
the

conclusion
although
there
be
