can

some
feature
be
overlap

the
two
and
there
be
some
confusion
about
what
should
be
use

what
use
requirement_2
this
try
to
elaborate
on
the
pro
and
con
of
both
technology_4
and
the
use
requirement_2
that
they
fit
the
best
technology_1
and
technology_2
be
actually
two
quite
different
technology_4
technology_2
be
a
general
purpose
pattern_1
component_3
pattern_2
component_4
which
offer
strong
quality_attribute_2
quality_attribute_3
and
fault
tolerance
support
it
be
not
specifically
design

technology_5
technology_5
ecosystem
be
be

technology_7
technology_1
be
a
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_5
and
quality_attribute_6
component_4
for
efficiently
connector_2
aggregate
and
move
large
amount
of
connector_data_1
from
many
different
component_6
to
a
centralized
connector_data_1
component_7
such
a
technology_8
or
technology_9
it
be
more
tightly
quality_attribute_7
with
technology_5
ecosystem
for
example
the
technology_10
technology_8
connector_3
quality_attribute_7
with
the
technology_8
quality_attribute_8
very
well
so
it
common
use
requirement_2
be
to
act
a
a
connector_data_1
pipeline
to
ingest
connector_data_1
into
technology_5
image
take
from
technology_6
technology_7
technology_10
entry
flume_ng_architecture
compare
to
technology_10
technology_2
win
on
the
it
superb
quality_attribute_3
and
messsage
durablity
technology_2
be
very
quality_attribute_9
one
of
the
key
benefit
of
technology_2
be
that
it
be
very
easy
to
large
number
of
component_8
without
affect
requirement_3
and
without
down
time
that
s
because
technology_2
do
not
track
which
connector_data_2
in
the
topic
have
be
connector_4
by
component_5
it
simply
keep
all
connector_data_2
in
the
topic
within
a
quality_attribute_10
period
it
be
the
component_5
responsibility
to
do
the
track
through
offset
in
contrast
more
component_8
to
technology_1
mean
connector_5
the
topology
of
technology_1
pipeline
design
replicate
the
pattern_3
to
connector_6
the
connector_data_2
to
a
connector_3
it
be
not
really
a
quality_attribute_9
solution
when
you
have
huge
number
of
component_5
also
since
the
technology_10
topology
need
to
be
connector_5
it
require
some
down
time
technology_2
s
quality_attribute_3
be
also
demonstrate
by
it
ability
to
handle
spike
of
the
this
be
where
kakfa
truly
shin
because
it
act
a
a
shock
absorber
between
the
component_9
and
component_5
technology_2
can
handle
at
100k+
per
second
rate
come
from
component_10
because
technology_2
component_8
connector_7
connector_data_1
from
the
topic
different
component_8
can
connector_4
the
connector_data_2
at
different
pace
technology_2
also
support
different
consumption
component_3
you
can
have
one
component_5
component_1
the
connector_data_2
at
real
time
and
another
component_5
component_1
the
connector_data_2
in
pattern_4
mode
on
the
contrary
technology_1
connector_3
support
connector_8
component_3
when
component_9
suddenly
generate
a
flood
of
connector_data_3
even
though
technology_10
pattern_3
somewhat
act
a
a
buffer
between
component_11
and
connector_3
the
connector_3
might
still
be
overwhelm
by
the
connector_9
connector_data_3
quality_attribute_2
be
also
an
important
consideration
technology_1
support
both
ephemeral
memory
base
pattern_3
and
quality_attribute_11
base
pattern_3
even
when
you
use
a
quality_attribute_11
base
pattern_3
any
component_7
in
a
pattern_3
not
yet
connector_9
to
a
connector_3
will
be
unavailable
until
the
agent
be
recover
moreoever
the
base
pattern_3
do
not
replicate
connector_data_1
to
a
different
technology_11
it
totally
quality_attribute_12
on
the
quality_attribute_2
of
the
storage
it
connector_10
upon
if
connector_data_3
quality_attribute_2
be
crucial
it
be
recommend
to
use
san
or
raid
technology_2
support
both
pattern_5
and
pattern_6
pattern_7
base
on
your
quality_attribute_2
requirement
and
it
u
commodity
hard
drive
technology_1
do
have
some
feature
that
make
it
attractive
to
be
a
connector_data_1
ingestion
and
quality_attribute_13
component_1
technology_12
the
key
benefit
of
technology_1
be
that
it
support
many
build
in
component_6
and
connector_3
which
you
can
use
out
of
component_12
if
you
use
technology_2
most
likely
you
have
to
connector_9
your
own
component_10
and
component_5
of
a
kakfa
become
more
and
more
popular
other
technology_12
be
constantly
requirement_4
support
for
technology_2
for
example
technology_7
technology_13
technology_2
spout
in
release
allow
technology_13
topology
to
connector_4
connector_data_1
from
technology_2
x
directly
technology_2
do
not
technology_14
requirement_5
support
for
connector_data_3
component_1
so
mostly
likely
it
need
to
quality_attribute_7
with
other
component_1
technology_12
such
a
technology_7
technology_13
to
complete
the
in
contrast
technology_1
support
different
connector_data_1
flow
component_13
and
pattern_8
chain
which
make
pattern_9
and
transform
very
easy
for
example
you
can
pattern_9
out
connector_data_2
that
you
be
not
interest
in
the
pipeline
first
before
connector_11
it
through
the
requirement_6
for
obvious
requirement_3
reason
however
it
be
not
suitable
for
complex
component_1
which
i
will
connector_12
in
a
future
the
quality_attribute_14
news
be
that
the
late
trend
be
to
use
both
together
to
connector_13
the
best
of
both
world
for
example
technology_1
in
cdh
start
to
connector_1
connector_data_1
from
technology_2
via
the
kafkasource
and
connector_8
to
technology_2
use
the
kafkasink
also
cdh
