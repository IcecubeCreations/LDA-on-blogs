technology_1
requirement_1
requirement_2
be
improvement
technology_1
requirement_1
be
a
slow
way
to
create
a
copy
of
an
connector_data_1
but
can
it
actually
improve
the
requirement_2
of
our
this
require
a
basic
knowledge
about
shape
and
inline
pattern_1
if
you
didn’t
connector_1
technology_2
optimization
it
might
be
difficult
to
follow
this
one
problemcreating
a
copy
of
an
connector_data_1
be
common
practice
in
j
you’ve
probably
do
that
while
create
reducer
in
redux
or
anywhere
else
currently
most
use
syntax
to
do
this
be
spreadconst
obja
=
{
name
jack
surname
sparrow
}
objb

obja
}

it
can

if
you
test
how
long
it
would
take
to
copy

use
those
you

every
time
we’re

assign
m
test
with
technology_1
requirement_1
m
clearly
technology_1
requirement_1
be
the
slow
of
them
and
by
some
margin
why
should
you
even
consider
use
it
instead
of
spread
not
so
obvious
behavior
of
technology_2
engineeverything
come
to
how
technology_2
be
optimize
every
time
be
connector_3
technology_2
be
compare
connector_data_1
pass
to
it
with
ic
inline
pattern_1
and
if
shape
of
that
connector_data_1
be
component_1
inside
one
of
the
pattern_1
then
technology_2
could
follow
fast
path
so
if
you
have
a
thatfunction
test
obj
{
connector_data_3
=
for
i
=
i
n
i
+=
{
connector_data_3
+=
obj
a
+
obj
b
}
connector_data_3
}you
can
run
it
with
multiple
connector_data_4
of
the
same
shape
and
have
a
great
performanceconst
jack
=
{
name
jack
surname
sparrow
}
frodo

{
name
frodo
surname
baggins
}
charles

{
name
charles

xavier
}
test
jack
test
frodo
test
charles
the
reason
for
that
be
because
technology_2
be
go
to
mark
that
a
monomorphic
and
optimize
it
a
you
only
time
it
happen
be
when
the
be
connector_4
with
one
and
only
one
shape
let’s
connector_5
what
kind
of
shape
be
produce
when
use

}what
be
important
here
be
that
do
sth
expensive
and
component_2
block
this
example
be
stupid
but
imagine
there
be
some
complex
mathematical
go
on
that’s
how
we
connector_data_5
our
in
two
different
waysconst

test

test

}
}this
be
a
quite
common
scenario
we
don’t
want
to
affect
exist
connector_data_1
so
we
decide
to
create
a
copy
of
it
if
you
set
n
to
and
run
this
loop
the
connector_data_3
might
surprise
you
test
with
requirement_1
m
test
with
spread
m
what
technology_4
be
time
slow
than
technology_1
requirement_1
if
that
s
weird
remember
what
i
ve
say
beforev8
be
go
to
mark
that
a
monomorphic
and
optimize
it
codebecause
the
test
be
not
a
quality_attribute_1
be
quality_attribute_1
but
expensive
to
run
the
initial
cost
of
connector_7
technology_1
stringify
and
technology_1
requirement_1
be
way
lower
than
run
that
without
optimization
in
the
second
test
run
that
become
megamorphic
and
technology_2
stop
optimize
it
you
can
connector_5
this
gist
to
try
it
on
your
component_3
conclusionit’s
important
to
understand
how
technology_5
optimization
work
when
design
complex
computation
in
technology_6
sometimes
even
a
quality_attribute_1
thing
can
cause
requirement_2
to
drop
and
you
can
spend
day
try
to
figure
out
what’s
happen
i’m
not
say
to
replace
all
spread
operator
with
technology_1
requirement_1
that
would
decrease
the
requirement_2
of
your
component_4
my
point
be
that
sometimes
reduce
the
requirement_2
of
one
thing
can
drastically
improve
the
requirement_2
of
another
the
requirement_3
i’ve
describe
be
a
really
special
one
and
might
affect
you
only
when
a
do
sth
expensive
but
that
can
help
you
approach
the
problem
