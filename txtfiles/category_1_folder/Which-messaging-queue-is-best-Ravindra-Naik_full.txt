my
experiment
use
ravindranaik
which
pattern_1
component_1
be
best
pattern_1
be
one
of
the
most
important
aspect
of
modern
programming
technique
majority
of
today’s
component_2
consist
of
several
and
external
connector_1
if
they
weren’t
able
to
connector_2
with
each
other
in
an
quality_attribute_1
manner
they
wouldn’t
be
very
quality_attribute_2
in
carry
out
their
intend
there
be
quite
a
few
pattern_1
component_3
quality_attribute_3
on
the
requirement_1
today
some
of
the
popular
one
be
technology_1
technology_2
technology_3
sqs
requirement_1
pattern_2
etc
there
be
no
doubt
that
we
need
a
pattern_1
component_1
for
several
but
which
one
in
this
i
would
to
give
a
try
on
answer
that
question
technology_3
technology_3
be
an
open_source
connector_data_1
pattern_3
manage
by
pivotal
it
connector_3
the
advance
connector_data_1
pattern_4
technology_4
technology_5
technology_3
come
with
a
build
in
requirement_2
requirement_3
for
easy
configuration
and
pattern_5
of
connector_data_1
component_1
it
also
support
connector_data_2
for
connector_data_1
acknowledgment
and
be
easily
quality_attribute_4
in
ha
mode
with
minimal
effort
with
a
connector_data_1
rate
of
about
20k+
msg
sec
which
be
much
le
than
technology_2
it’s
sufficient
enough
for
most
use
requirement_4
due
to
it
component_4
independent
technology_6
and
ease
of
use
technology_3
be
a
very
mature
connector_data_1
pattern_3
offer
with
a
lot
of
extend
support
from
the
technology_7
quality_attribute_5
component_1
component_5
sqs
be
amazon’s
requirement_1
base
connector_data_1
pattern_4
component_6
make
quality_attribute_3
a
part
of
web
component_7
technology_8
unlike
the
other
pattern_3
mention
here
there
be
barely
any
setup
deployment
require
for
an
component_8
to
use
sqs
all
you
need
be
technology_9
credential
to
be
able
to
use
it
since
it
be
a
pattern_6
a
a
component_5
this
make
it
a
much
lower
cost
option
since
there
be
no
infrastructure
cost
you
only
pay
for
what
you
use
technology_7
also
have
the
notion
of
in
flight
connector_data_1
this
mean
that
the
connector_data_1
be
connector_4
off
the
component_1
but
never
delete
until
the
‘delete‘
command
be
connector_5
for
that
connector_data_1
so
if
you
lose
your
component_9
mid
component_10
of
the
that
isn’t
lose
for
quality_attribute_6
one
drawback
of
the
technology_7
implementation
be
the
need
for
pattern_7
of
a
connector_data_1
component_1
to
determine
if
connector_data_3
have
appear
this
be
a
bit
of
an
issue
be
a
you
must
now
component_11
your
component_8
to
perform
a
pattern_7
cycle
in
order
to
determine
if
connector_data_3
be
quality_attribute_3
while
the
technology_7
cost
be
reasonable
place
a
limit
on
the
connector_data_1
rate
which
can
be
increase
on
connector_data_4
and
also
charge
extra
base
on
the
overall
connector_data_1
rate
technology_1
technology_2
technology_1
technology_2
be
a
connector_data_1
pattern_3
that
be
originally
develop
by
linkedin
before
go
open_source
under
the
technology_1
umbrella
kafka’s
focus
be
quality_attribute_7
and
quality_attribute_8
it
can
maintain
a
connector_data_1
quality_attribute_9
rate
of
100k+
msg
sec
which
be
significantly
high
than
most
other
alternative
however
other
basic
feature
find
in
other
pattern_3
be
eschew
in
favor
of
quality_attribute_8
feature
connector_data_1
acknowledgment
connector_6
rule
and
an
admin
ui
be
not
quality_attribute_3
a
technology_10
even
though
technology_2
be
define
a
‘stable’
and
‘production
ready’
quality_attribute_4
technology_2
in
ha
mode
be
tough
than
it
be
with
other
technology_11
it
be
highly
dependent
on
the
technology_12
in
order
to
maintain
synchronization
between
multiple
technology_2
technology_13
and
component_12
component_13
requirement_1
pattern_2
google’s
requirement_1
pattern_2
be
a
fully
manage
real
time
pattern_1
component_5
that
allow
you
to
connector_7
and
connector_8
connector_data_3
between
component_14
or
component_15
it
be
develop
specifically
to
facilitate
pattern_1
among
component_14
quality_attribute_4
on
the
compute
component_16
gce
requirement_1
it
basic
feature
be
very
similar
to
that
of
amazon’s
technology_7
in
that
there
be
no
infrastructure
cost
and
you
pay
for
what
you
use
the
major
difference
from
technology_7
be
that
charge
base
only
on
volume
and
not
transaction
quality_attribute_7
i
e
you
will
not
be
charge
extra
for
a
sudden
increase
in
connector_data_1
rate
component_17
id=2
with
this
connector_data_5
i
hope
you
have
a
clear
understand
that
there
be
no
single
component_1
which
can
cater
to
all
type
of
need
different
component_3
be
quality_attribute_6
at
different
thing
you
have
to
pick
the
right
one
for
the
problem
