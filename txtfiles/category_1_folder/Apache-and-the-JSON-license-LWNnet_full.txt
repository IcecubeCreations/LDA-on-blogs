that

that

apparently
base

a

he
point

a
lazy

form
that
the

do
not
preclude

dun
point

the
joke
a

term
quality_attribute_1

leave
quite
a
bit
to
be
desire
to
me
all
of
this
clearly
show
that
the
technology_3

be
substantially
hinder
downstream
adoption
due
to
a
perception
by
those
downstream
component_5
that
you
can

put

i
frankly
agree
with
those
folk
not
do

be
a
quality_attribute_1
thing
and
i
try
to
do
that
myself
but
have
to
connector_1
a
legal
opinion
that
everything
i
do
be
not

would
make
it
impossible
to
connector_1
anything
do
dun
suggest
that
the

move

multiple
connector_data_2

it

there
be
no
real
support
for

plenty

see
it
be
ban
in

technology_1
s
vice
president
of
legal
affair
jim
jagielski
decide
to
ban
the
license
on
he
explain
his
reason
in
a
two
day
early
it
be
not
a
valid
fsf
nor
osi
license
a
such
it
be
not
a
true
open_source
license
and
have
no
place
a
cata
category
a
but
simply
remove
the
license
from
the
approve
connector_data_1
doesn
t
magically
fix
the
project
that
quality_attribute_2
on
use
it
dun
have
a
connector_data_1
of
around
a
dozen
technology_1
project
that
quality_attribute_2
on
technology_3
license
there
well
be
others
he
also
point
to
a
debian
web
component_2
connector_data_1
alternative
technology_2
implementation
but
work
need
to
be
do
to
switch
project
to
acceptable
alternatives—and
that
will
take
time
technology_1
project
cannot
make
release
use
that
be
cover
by
a
category
x
license
so
any
that
quality_attribute_2
on
technology_3
license
need
to
fix
that
alan
gate
wonder
if
there
could
be
some
kind
of
grace
period
for
project
to
come
into
compliance
he
note
that
the
technology_1
technology_4
connector_data_3
warehousing
project
be
in
the
middle
of
try
to
connector_1
out
a
quality_attribute_3
release
which
would
be
block
by
the
connector_3
others
be
similarly
affect
furthermore
the
amount
of
time
to
fix
this
will
not
be
trivial
base
on
a
little
bit
of
dig
i
ve
do
the
alternative
be
not
100%
identical
in
their
behavior
which
will
mean
project
will
need
to
thoroughly
test
the
replacement
and
connector_3
their
to
deal
with
the
difference
he
and
jagielski
have
speak
about
the
matter
and
the
latter
have
suggest
perhaps
a
grandfather
clause
that
would
allow
project
that
already
use
technology_3
license
to
continue
to
make
release
for
some
period
of
time
gate
propose
six
month
a
that
time
frame
in
general
that
idea
be
popular
but
there
be
some
wrinkle
dun
would
to
see
a
much
short
deadline
for
resolve
the
license
problem
he
have
do
some
work
to
make
it
easy
for
project
to
switch
to
a
properly
license
alternative
but
there
be
still
a
lot
of
test
that
need
to
be
do
to
ensure
everything
work
correctly
gate
ask
if
a
six
month
period
would
really
matter
give
that
the
license
have
be
present
in
technology_1
technology_5
for
year
but
dun
be
concern
that
technology_1
project
be
lose
component_6
over
it
we
be
already
see
component_6
reject
technology_1
because
of
this
issue
so
yes
it
will
matter
the
question
be
how
much
and
how
do
we
requirement_3
that
off
against
the
pain
involve
there
be
other
consideration
though
andrew
wang
say
that
the
technology_1
technology_6
technology_7
for
requirement_4
component_7
rely
on
third
party
technology_8
that
use
technology_3
license
we
can
t
simply
swap
it
out
in
addition
requirement_5
be
expect
to
only
make
bug
fix
for
multiple
year
he
say
so
switch
technology_8
will
be
problematic
from
that
perspective
i
ll
that
typical
eols
end
of
life
for
requirement_5
be
measure
in
multiple
year
if
i
have
my
druthers
we
technology_9
grandfather
in
exist
release
line
where
bump
technology_3
would
affect
quality_attribute_4
and
thus
eol
expectation
fail
that
give
u
at
least
until
would
be
significant
there
be
a
fair
amount
of
discussion
of
how
various
project
could
proceed
to
remove
the
connector_5
on
technology_3
license
but
no
clear
consensus
emerge
on
how
disruptive
the
connector_3
would
be
enough
of
a
consensus
on
have
a
grace
period
of
some
length
do
emerge
however
to
the
point
that
jagielski
issue
a
statement
that
prohibit
project
from
technology_2
license
connector_5
but
allow
others
some
time
to
make
the
connector_3
if
you
have
be
use
it
and
have
do
so
in
a
*release*
and
there
have
be
no
pushback
from
your
eco
component_8
you
have
a
temporary
exclusion
from
the
cat
x
classification
thru
at
that
point
in
time
any
and
all
usage
of
these
technology_2

artifact
be
disallow
you
must
either
find
a
suitably
license
replacement
or
do
without
there
will
be
no
exception
it
be
in
some
way
surprise
that
it
have
take
this
long
for
technology_1
to
tackle
this
particular
license
problem
other
organization
have
ban
the
license
for
year
and
technology_1
be
rather
notoriously
picky
about
license
the
determination
that
it
be

clause
back
in
seem
a
bit
strange
in
truth
but
there
have
be
no
real
outcry
over
our
usage
of
it
especially
from

component_3

other
component_5
of
our

which
use

jagielski
say
which
explain
why
it
hadn

now
it
be
likely
that
few
would
admit
to
use
the
technology_3

for

however
that
be
define
but
that
isn

really
the
crux
of
the
matter
legal
department
be
understandably
leery
of
how
others
and
court
in
particular
might
interpret
the
clause
it
be
quite
ambiguous
and
corporate

team
go
to
great
length
to
avoid
that
kind
of
thing
when
they
can
give

it

perhaps
also

the

clearly
non

be
for

i
think
the
lesson
to

here
be
similar
to
what
be
about
defect
fix

problem
early
be
le
expensive
however
sometimes
legal
issue
be
put
connector_10
for
other
reason
and
should
be
ignore
for
practical
reason
so
it
cannot
easily
be
detected
if
a
license
issue
at
hand
be
a
real
problem
for
the
jslint
license
it
have
become
clear
a
while
ago
that
mr

do
not
be
much
about

i
see
this
a
a
politically
difficult
but
most
welcome
movement
this
joke
in

joke
of

be
i
do

here
have
be
already
disapprove
for
debian
debian
be
well
for
it
uncompromising
attitude
towards
license
and
several
project
have
be
convinced
to
choose
a
sane
or
le
controversial
license
technology_16
because
of
debian
s
argument
in
this
requirement_11
this
be
not
enough
at
least
for
most
project
still
carry
it
the
technology_1

be
another
very
well
name
in
this
regard
and
very
well
recognize
a
a
top
player
when
it
come
to
the
web
world
although
clearly
it
do
not
stop
with
that
alone
yes
many
project
win
t
connector_3
and
we
be
likely
to
be
stick
with
the
technology_2
license
for
quality_attribute_1
however
this
position
statement
might
connector_12
many
other
project
to
choose
a
sane

probably
it
will
help

other
important

slowly
at

this
will
connector_12
