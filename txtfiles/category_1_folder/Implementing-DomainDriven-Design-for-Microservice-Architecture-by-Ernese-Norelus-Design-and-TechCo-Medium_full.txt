that

we

today’s

in
an
agile
way
the
component_17
themselves
be
straightforward
focus
on
do
only
one
thing
well
so
they’re
easy
to
test
and
ensure
high
quality
each
component_3
can
be
build
with
the
best
suit
technology_8
and
technology_9
allow
polyglot
persistence
and
such
you
don’t
have
to
be
stick
with
a
choice
of
technology_8
for
the
rest
of
the
project
multiple
developer
and
team
can
connector_22
independently
under
this
architecture
this
be
great
for
continuous
delivery
allow
frequent
release
while
keep
the
rest
of
the
component_12
quality_attribute_10
in
requirement_9
a
component_3
go
down
it
will
only
affect
the
part
that
directly
quality_attribute_3
on
it
if
there
be
such
part
the
other
part
will
continue
to
well
externalize
configuration
this
externalize
the
configuration
in
the
config
component_27
so
that
it
can
be
maintain
in
a
hierarchical
connector_data_4
per
environment
consistent
component_17
should
be
connector_4
in
a
consistent
style
a
per
the
cod
technology_10
and
name
convention
guidelines…resilient
component_17
should
handle
exception
arise
from
technical
reason
connector_23
and
runtime
and
requirement_1
reason
invalid
input
and
not
crash
pattern_3
such
a
circuit
breaker
and
bulk

help
isolate
and
contain
failure
quality_attribute_2
citizen
pattern_2
should
report
their
usage
statistic
the
number
of
time
they
be
connector_15
their
average
response_time
and
so
on
through
the
technology_11
component_24
or
the
technology_6
technology_4
versioned
pattern_2
need
to
support
multiple
version
for
different
component_25
until
all
component_25
migrate
to
high
version
there
should
be
a
clear
version
strategy
in
term
of
support
feature
and
bug
fixing…microservices
architecture
layersthe
requirement_1
component_17
tend
to
do
what
the
domain
component_9
and
requirement_10
pattern_7
use
to
do
and
so
be
still
connector_10
that
way
this
be
also
what
the
pattern_14
component_17
use
to
do
or
be
suppose
to
it’s
that
these
pattern_7
don’t
span
the
whole
component_28
they’re
pattern_5
within
each
component_3
yeah
the
o
r
connector_data_3
in
the
requirement_10
pattern_7
be
more
broadly
quality_attribute_11
when
the
pattern_7
span
the
whole
component_28
pattern_2
requirement_2
independence
over
quality_attribute_12
and
you
should
be
use
no
technology_12
component_21
anyway
so
you
shouldn’t
need
all
that
o
r
connector_data_3

but
to
tell
the
truth
some
requirement_1
component_17
will
still
need
to
with
component_29
requirement_5
component_21
of
component_30
which
be
technology_13
so
they’ll
need
o
r
connector_data_3

there’s
no
free
lunch
the
pattern_15
do
what
the
component_28
component_9
use
to
do
one
stop
shop
for
the
component_23
so
that
all
of
the
requirement_1
component_17
together
look
a
single
component_28
that
do
exactly
what
the
component_23
need
but
now
you
have
an
component_28
component_9
for
each
component_23
type
not
a
single
component_28
component_9
pattern_7
that
span
the
entire
component_28
what
happen
to
the
pattern_12
pattern_7
it
move
into
the
component_25
where
it
belong
all
along
either
the
component_23
be
a
requirement_11
component_28
which
be
a
pattern_12
with
perhaps
a
bit
of
it
component_28
component_9
or
it’s
a
partner
component_28
that’s
way
more
than
a
pattern_12
but
that
have
it
own
pattern_12
or
it’s
a
web
component_28
web
component_7
use
to
contain
a
lot
of
pattern_12
to
render
the
technology_14
and
need
state
from
the
pattern_12
in
an
technology_6
component_31
but
no
more
with
modern
technique
use
technology_14

and
technology_15

the
web
browser
us
download
from

to
do
all
that

use

usually
rather

someone
else

instead
put
the

the

be
go
to
have

have

not

the

to

because

a
a
way
to
collaborate
and
improve
the
component_1
component_9
and
resolve
any
emerge
domain
relate
issue
our
approach
be
to
put
some
connector_data_4
around
connector_17
to
understand
the
requirement_1
domain
by
analyze
the
domain
define
the

component_2
define
the

aggregate
and
component_17
and
finally
identify
the

offer
some
unique
advantage
over
traditional

and
it
provide
quality_attribute_6
quality_attribute_18

also
a
