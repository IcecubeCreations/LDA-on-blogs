meaningful
and

typically
requirement_1
first
realize
a

when
they
the

of
try

you
have
several
option
you
can
try

to
connector_2
a
solution
this
approach
can
work
for
some
situation
but
requirement_1
often
find
themselves
need
more
—
more
requirement_2
feature
more
quality_attribute_3
and
more
support
the
next
option
be
to
go
with

a

these
be

they’re

we’ll
dive

overview
incumbent
technology_1

make
up
the

of

that
stand
to
reason
they’ve
be
around
the
long
and
many
be
design

very
large

etc
so
the

be
substantial
some
of
these
technology_2
consist
of
a

use
together
customize

and
because
many
requirement_1
have
their
connector_data_1
component_5
in
component_6

component_1
the
manufacturer
be
well
position
