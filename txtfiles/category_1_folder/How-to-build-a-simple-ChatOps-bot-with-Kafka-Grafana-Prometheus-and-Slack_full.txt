by
luc
russellhow
to
build
a
quality_attribute_1
chatops
requirement_1
with
technology_1
grafana
prometheus
and
slackthis
describe
an
approach
for
build
a
quality_attribute_1
chatops
requirement_1
which
us
slack
and
grafana
to
query
component_1
status
the
idea
be
to
be
able
to
connector_1
the
status
of
your
component_1
with
a
conversational
if
you’re
away
from
your
desk
but
still
have
basic
connector_2
e
g
on
your
phone
this
be
split
into
two
part
the
first
part
will
set
up
the
infrastructure
for
pattern_1
technology_1
with
prometheus
and
grafana
and
the
second
part
will
build
a
quality_attribute_1
requirement_1
with
technology_2
which
can
respond
to
question
and
coding_keyword_1
grafana
graph
over
slack
connector_data_1
be
a
requirement_2
feature
of
grafana
i
e
the
ability
to
connector_3
alert
connector_data_2
to
a
slack
pattern_2
if
condition
be
breach
a
slack
requirement_1
be
a
slightly
different
technology_3
it
will
be
able
to
respond
to
quality_attribute_1
question
about
the
state
of
a
component_1
to
assist
with
troubleshoot
the
goal
be
to
design
something
which
run
inside
a
firewalled
environment
without
require
pattern_3
connector_4
or
connector_4
to
any
3rd
party
component_2
technology_4
graph
image
be
therefore
generate
on
the
local
component_1
and
connector_5
a
attachment
to
slack
to
avoid
component_3
on
coding_keyword_2
infrastructure
componentsthe
coding_keyword_3
component_4
here
be
technology_1
a
connector_data_3
connector_6
component_5
this
be
the
component_1
we’re
interest
in
pattern_4
prometheus
a
pattern_1
component_1
for
connector_7
metric
at
give
interval
evaluate
rule
and
connector_8
alert
prometheus
technology_5
exporter
a
prometheus
collector
that
can
scrape
and
connector_9
technology_5
connector_data_4
allow
u
to
connector_10
metric
from
technology_1
grafana
a
visualization
component_5
commonly
use
for
visualize
time
series
connector_data_4
for
infrastructure
and
component_6
requirement_3
this
allow
u
to
graphically
display
connector_10
metric
slack
the
pattern_5
component_6
which
will
allow
u
to
with
our
chat
requirement_1
slack
requirement_1
describe
in
part
two
below
a
quality_attribute_1
technology_2
script
which
can
connector_11
graph
from
grafana
and
connector_12
to
slack
these
step
be
base
around
pattern_1
technology_1
but
the
same
general
approach
could
be
follow
to
quality_attribute_2
with
other
component_7
let’s
connector_13
startedfull
component_8
be
quality_attribute_3
here
prerequisitesbasic
knowledge
of
technology_2
the
be
connector_14
for
technology_2


technology_6
technology_6
compose
be
use
to
run
the
technology_1
pattern_6
kafkacat
this
be
a
useful
technology_3
for
connector_15
with
technology_1
e
g
publish
connector_data_2
to
topic
note
if
you’re
in
a
hurry
to
start
everything
up
clone
the
project
from
the
connector_16
above
and
run
technology_6
compose
up
technology_7
there
be
two
part
to
the
remainder
of
this

the
first
part
describe
how
to
set
up
the
pattern_1
infrastructure
and
the
second
walk
through
the
technology_2
for
the
slack
requirement_1
part
one
assemble
a
pattern_1
stackwe’ll
use
grafana
and
prometheus
to
set
up
a
pattern_1
technology_8
the
component_7
to
be
pattern_4
be
technology_1
which
mean
we’ll
need
a
bridge
to
export
technology_5
connector_data_4
from
technology_1
to
prometheus
this
prometheus
technology_5
exporter
technology_6
image
fulfill
this
role
nicely
this
component_7
extract
metric
from
kafka’s
technology_5
component_9
and
connector_17
them
over
technology_9
so
they
can
be
pattern_7
by
prometheus
to
enable
technology_5
metric
in
the
technology_1
component_9
we
need
to
apply
some
configuration
setting
to
the
technology_1
component_9
and
connector_16
the
technology_1
technology_5
exporter
container
with
the
technology_1
component_9
ensure
the
kafka_jmx_optsand
jmx_port
environment
variable
be
set
on
the
technology_1
containerensure
the
technology_1
technology_5
exporter
and
technology_1
container
be
on
the
same
requirement_4
backend
ensure
the
jmx_host
requirement_5
for
the
technology_1
technology_5
exporter
container
match
the
kafka_advertised_host_name
on
the
technology_1
containerensure
the
kafka_advertised_host_name
have

however
