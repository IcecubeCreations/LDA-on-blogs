leave
a
pattern_1
can
have
a
major
impact
on
organization
look
to
increase
automation
and
deployment
quality_attribute_1
the
big
requirement_1
in
the
world
â
netflix
etc
â
all
work
on
this
architecture
component_1
and
release
at
lightning
quality_attribute_1
so
why
be
use
pattern_1
so
quality_attribute_2
the
easy
way
to
understand
pattern_1
architecture
be
by
compare
it
to
it
counterpart
â
the
monolith
with
a
monolithic
architecture
all
of
the
component_2
be
part
of
a
single
unit
everything
be
develop
quality_attribute_3
and
quality_attribute_4
together
in
comparison
pattern_1
have
each
component_3
break
out
and
quality_attribute_3
individually
a
component_4
and
these
component_5
connector_3
with
each
other
via
component_6
connector_data_1
for
complex
component_7
that
need
to
run
at
quality_attribute_4
pattern_1
can
offer
great
quality_attribute_5
quality_attribute_6
and
a
fast
pace
of
innovation
than
monolith
no
monolith
arenât
inherently
bad
but
team
stick
in
a
monolith
component_8
often
sacrifice
quality_attribute_1
for
quality_attribute_7
and
that
could
haunt
them
in
the
long
term
so
what
do
you
do
when
you
want
to
make
the
switch
to
pattern_1
and
start
connector_1
fast
consider
these
option
the
strangler
martin
fowlerâs
strangler
be
inspire
by
a
trip
he
take
to
australia
âone
of
the
natural
wonder
of
this
area
australia
be
the
huge
strangler
vine
they
seed
in
the
upper
branch
of
a
fig
tree
and
gradually
work
their
way
down
the
tree
until
they
root
in
the
soil
over
many
year
they
grow
into
fantastic
and
beautiful
shape
meanwhile
strangle
and
kill
the
tree
that
be
their
component_9
â
it
sound
brutal
base
on
this
description
but
itâs
actually
one
of
the
gentlest
and
most
quality_attribute_2
transition
for
an
organization
essentially
part
of
the
monolith
become
pattern_1
little
by
little
until
eventually
the
monolith
be
cut
out
completely
the
benefit
be
that
this
transition
be
much
more
gradual
so
uptime
and
quality_attribute_8
be
largely
unaffected
while
the
organization
modernize
the
con
quality_attribute_1
the
lego
strategy
letâs
say
you
donât
necessarily
want
to
ditch
the
monolith
completely
maybe
it
have
a
valuable
use
for
a
certain
technology_1
or
facet
of
the
organization
or
maybe
you
donât
have
the
resource
to
dismantle
it
or
donât
want
to
the
lego
strategy
could
be
the
right
choice
the
team
at
kong
use
this
term
because
youâre
essentially
build
on
top
of
what
you
already
have
lego
block
instead
of
switch
over
to
pattern_1
completely
you
connector_4
to
build
feature
a
pattern_1
while
still
keep
the
exist
monolithic
codebase
while
this
approach
doesnât
fix
current
issue
it
will
help
with
future
expansion
and
buy
much
need
time
this
hybrid
environment
can
exist
relatively
pain
free
but
have
some
risk
increase
technical
debt
navigate
version
between
the
monolith
and
the
pattern_1
feature
and
quality_attribute_9
cost
the
nuclear
option
imagine
your
monolith
be
kaput
finito
dunzo
it
canât
be
fix
and
it
canât
stay
what
now
a
the
name
suggest
go
nuclear
be
the
riskiest
and
rarest
option
of
all
the
upside
be
that
you
can
start
from
scratch
the
downside
isâ¦
you
start
from
scratch
this
approach
be
risky
because
you
do
run
the
risk
of
downtime
when
everything
shift
over
to
pattern_1
â
which
be
a
real
no
no
for
requirement_2
infrastructure
be
best
when
itâs
invisible
and
a
pattern_1
architecture
wonât
win
back
the
favor
of
component_10
that
be
inconvenience
then
again
maybe
your
pattern_1
architecture
be
build
perfectly
and
requirement_3
and
staff
be
perfectly
in
place
and
component_10
will
never
the
difference
thatâs
the
risk
of
a
full
rip
and
replace
a
successful
transition
to
pattern_1
the

guide

conversation
the
old
argument
for

have
always
be
their
quality_attribute_7
theyâre
easy
to

easy
