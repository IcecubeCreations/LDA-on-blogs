it’s
important
for

their

this
help
them
to

in

we’ll
build

that
us
a

all

make
to

we’ll

our

start

you

then
start

start
visit

requirement_2

requirement_1
then
play
around
with
the

by
visit
a
few
component_15
the
wait
url
with
different
requirement_9
for
the
number
of
second
and
watch
the
stats
display
on
the
requirement_2
connector_18
in

note
you
might
see
that
the
number
of
connector_data_2
increase
by
more
than
one
when
you
visit
a
component_15
that’s
because
it’s
also
count
the
connector_data_2
for
the
technology_15
include
with
express
conclusion
in
this

we’ve
build
a
technology_5
that
track
every
connector_data_5
a
component_12
that
compute
requirement_1
for
u
base
on
these
track
and
a

that
display
them
thanks
to

we’ve
be
