architectural
principle
for
design
modern
web
component_1
the
key
objective
of
a
architect
be
to
minimize
the
complexity
of
requirement_4
component_2
by
segregate
the
design
into
various
area
of
concern
the
creation
of
a
well
design
component_2
architecture
of
large
web
component_1
pose
immense
challenge
in
the
development
component_3
component_2
architecture
design
decision
can
significantly
influence
the
component_2
quality_attribute_1
and
quality_attribute_2
the
success
lie
in
creation
of
an
architectural
technology_2
that
be
responsive
to
the
architectural
challenge
of
these
web
component_4
a
comprehensive
understand
of
the
architectural
design
principle
will
help
requirement_5
to
manage
many
challenge
ahead
face
at
the
time
of
implementation
ideally
these
principle
will
lead
requirement_5
toward
create
component_1
out
of
isolate
component_5
that
be
not
closely
interconnect
to
other
part
of
the
component_4
but
rather
connector_1
through
explicit
or
pattern_1
component_2
separation
of
concern
a
key
principle
of
design
this
principle
encompass
creation
of
a
component_2
architecture
with
pattern_2
component_5
each
connector_2
a
separate
concern
the
architecture
design
create
use
this
principle
can
be
maintain
easily
be
le
tightly
couple
and
far
le
likely
to
break
the
don’t
repeat
yourself
principle
architecture
design
by
quality_attribute_3
this
principle
keep
requirement_5
component_6
and
rule
in
discreet
location
while
infrastructure
and
component_7
reside
in
a
separate
project
this
ensure
that
iteration
in
design
do
not
affect
the
core
requirement_5
component_8
at
the
same
time
the
component_8
can
be
test
easily
for
it
efficacy
pattern_3
pattern_3
be
define
a
the
casing
up
of
connector_data_1
inside
a
single
discreet
unit
this
principle
hold
together
the
and
the
connector_data_1
it
manage
in
other
word
pattern_3
protect
the
connector_data_1
from
be
connector_3
by
component_9
outside
the
unit
architect
utilize
this
key
principle
of
pattern_3
or
connector_data_2
orient
programming
use
a
programming
technology_3
technology_4
which
lend
their
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_5
and
easy
quality_attribute_2
this
allow
the
developer
to
design
construct
connector_data_2
and

that
can
be
declare
a
a
coding_keyword_2
where
component_10
can
connector_1
without
the
internal
implementation
be
tamper
or
the
dependant
component_11
connector_4
affect
most
developer
be
comfortable
use
pattern_3
to
hide
instance
variable
of
a
from
an
illegal
direct
connector_5
this
hide
connector_data_1
can
be
connector_3
only
through
any
member
of
it
own
in
which
they
be
declare
this
be
popularly

a
connector_data_1
hide
pattern_3
provide
a
great
deal
of
quality_attribute_5
to
requirement_4
component_2
the
entire
requirement_5
component_3
can
be
overhaul
without
significant
connector_6
in
the
delivery
component_3
pattern_3
enable
oo
expert
to
design
agile
component_2
component_12
that
be
open
to
connector_7
a
your
requirement_5
undergo
transformation
a
single
of
the
entire
component_2
can
undergo
connector_6
independently
without
any
impact
on
any
other
of
the
component_2
single
responsibility
this
be
one
of
the
most
widely
apply
principle
by
developer
to
build
quality_attribute_6
quality_attribute_7
and
easy
to
maintain
component_4
this
can
be
apply
not
to
or
pattern_4
but
also
to
component_13
it
quality_attribute_8
be
it
key
feature
make
the
component_4
easy
to
connector_8
and
open
to
connector_6
in
the
future
one
of
the
key
consideration
be
that
component_4
requirement
connector_7
over
a
period
and
if
your

component_13
have
be
assign
multiple
responsibility
the
more
frequently
you
need
to
connector_7
it
and
they
cease
to
be
independent
of
each
other
don’t
repeat
yourself
connector_6
effect
in
one
necessitate
connector_data_3
or
recompilation
of
the
dependant

quality_attribute_9
on
your
connector_7
you
might
need
to
update
the
connector_9
or
recompile
the
dependent
even
though
they
be
not
directly
affect
by
your
connector_7
consequently
you
have
to
need
update
your
more
often
each
connector_7
connector_4
more
complex
hence
the
single
responsibility
principle
ensure
that
each
be
assign
only
one
responsibility

component_5
and
pattern_4
that
have
only
one
responsibility
be
easy
to
maintain
test
or
debug
and
lead
to
fast
deployment
the
don’t
repeat
yourself
dry
principle
state
that
duplication
in
component_6
should
be
eliminate
via
abstraction
duplication
in
component_3
should
be
eliminate
via
automation
duplication
be
waste

additional
unnecessary
to
a
codebase
increase
the
amount
of
work
require
to
extend
and
maintain
the
in
the
future
duplicate

to
technical
debt
whether
the
duplication
stem
from
copy
paste
programming
or
poor
understand
of
how
to
apply
abstraction
it
decrease
the
quality
of
the

duplication
in
component_3
be
also
waste
if
it
can
be
automate
manual
test
manual
build
and
requirement_6
component_3
etc
should
all
be
eliminate
whenever
possible
through
the
use
of
automation
connector_9
inversion
principle
this
principle
of
architecture
design
deal
with
high
level
of
the
component_4
which
generally
involve
complex
component_6
this
mean
they
be
easily
quality_attribute_10
and
be
unaffected
by
the
connector_6
in
low
level
which
basically
deal
with
the
utility
feature
of
the
component_4
an
abstraction
need
to
be
introduce
to
that
can
decouple
the
high
level
and
low
level
from
each
other
an
introduction
of
a
quality_attribute_11
abstraction
between
the
high
level
and
lower
level
component_5
eliminate
the
connector_9
between
them
the
connector_9
inversion
principle
enable
architect
to
modify
the
high
level
a
well
a
lower
level
component_5
without
affect
any
other
if
the
abstraction
remain
the
same
in
other
word
the
principle
state
that
“both
the
component_5
should
quality_attribute_9
on
abstraction
”
however
it
must
be
note
that
the
connector_9
inversion
principle
be
not
something
that
can
be
use
to
resolve
connector_9
instead
it
enable
developer
to
design
an
architecture
that
allow
to
test
various
of
the
component_4
in
isolation
explicit
connector_9
principle
strong
inter

connector_9

regard
a

indicator
of
poor

difficult
to
work
with
a
different

be

easily
in

and
revision
or
extension

requirement_7
cannot
be

architectural
connector_9
proactively
in
the
development
life
cycle
along
with
metric

to
quality_attribute_12
connector_10
of
architecture
quality
if
a
component_13
or
rely
on
other
component_5
to
accomplish
it

then
the
other
component_5
be

a
the
connector_9
for
this

or
component_5
can
have
both
implicit
or
explicit
connector_9
this
principle
of
architectural
design
explicitly
declare

level
connector_9
at
the
time
of
construction
most
of
the
time
a

an
which
can
be
exchange
with
other
implementation
at
any
point
in
the

whether
