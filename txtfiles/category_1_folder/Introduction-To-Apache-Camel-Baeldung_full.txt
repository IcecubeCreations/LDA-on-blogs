start
with

and
technology_3
through
the
technology_3
connector_2
out
the
overview
in
this
we
ll
introduce
technology_2
and
explore
one
of
it
core
concept
–
connector_data_2
connector_3
we
ll
start
by
cover
these
foundational
concept
and
terminology
and
we
ll
then
present
two
option
for
define
connector_3
–
technology_4
dsl
and
technology_3
dsl
we
ll
also
demonstrate
these
on
an
example
–
by
define
a
connector_4
which
connector_5
from
one
folder
and
move
them
to
another
while
prepending
a
pattern_2
to
each

about

technology_1
technology_2
be
an
open_source
requirement_1
technology_7
design
to
make
quality_attribute_2
component_3
quality_attribute_3
and
easy
it
allow
end
component_4
to
quality_attribute_2
various
component_3
use
the
same
technology_8
provide
support
for
multiple
technology_9
and
connector_data_1
type
while
be
quality_attribute_4
and
allow
the
introduction
of
custom
technology_9
technology_10
connector_6
in
order
to
use
technology_2
we
need
to
first
the
technology_10
connector_6
connector_6
technology_1
technology_2
technology_2
core
version
version

the
late
version
of
the

artifact
can
be
find
here
domain
specific
technology_11
connector_3
and
connector_7
component_5
be
the
central
part
of
technology_2
connector_3
contain
the
flow
and
component_6
of
requirement_1
between
different
component_7
in
order
to
define
connector_3
more
easy
and
clean
technology_2
offer
several
different
domain
specific
technology_11
dsl
for
programming
technology_11
technology_4
or
technology_12
on
the
other
hand
it
also
provide
define
connector_3
in
connector_data_3
with
technology_3
dsl
use
either
technology_4
dsl
or
technology_3
dsl
be
mostly
component_8
preference
a
most
of
the
feature
be
quality_attribute_5
in
both
technology_4
dsl
offer
a
bit
more
feature
which
be
not
support
in
technology_3
dsl
however
technology_3
dsl
be
sometimes
more
beneficial
a
connector_data_3
can
be
connector_8
without
the
need
to
recompile
the
terminology
and
architecture
s
now
discus
the
basic
technology_2
terminology
and
architecture
first
we
ll
have
a
look
at
the
core
technology_2
concept
here
connector_data_2
contain
connector_data_1
which
be
be
transfer
to
a
connector_4
each
connector_data_2
have
a
unique
identifier
and
it
s
construct
out
of
a
body
and
attachment
exchange
be
the
container
of
a
connector_data_2
and
it
be
create
when
a
connector_data_2
be
connector_9
by
a
component_9
during
the
connector_7
component_10
exchange
allow
different
type
of
connector_10
between
component_3
–
it
can
define
a
one
way
connector_data_2
or
a
connector_data_4
connector_11
connector_data_2
be
a
pattern_3
through
which
component_7
can
connector_12
or
connector_13
a
connector_data_2
it
can
refer
to
a
web
component_11
uri
component_12
uri
connector_14
etc
component_13
act
a
an
factory
to
put
it
simply
component_14
offer
an
to
different
technology_13
use
the
same
approach
and
syntax
technology_2
already
support
a
lot
of
component_14
in
it
dsl
for
almost
every
possible
technology_13
but
it
also
give
the
ability
for
connector_15
custom
component_14
processor
be
a
quality_attribute_3
technology_4
which
be
use
to
custom
requirement_1
component_6
to
a
connector_4
it
contain
a
single
component_10
use
to
preform
custom
requirement_2
component_6
on
a
connector_data_2
connector_9
by
a
component_9
at
a
high
level
the
architecture
of
technology_2
be
quality_attribute_3
camelcontext
represent
the
technology_2
runtime
component_7
and
it
wire
different
concept
such
a
connector_3
component_14
or
and
below
that
processor
handle
connector_7
and
transformation
between
while
quality_attribute_2
different
component_7
define
a
connector_4
connector_3
can
be
define
with
technology_4
dsl
or
technology_3
dsl
we
ll
illustrate
both
style
by
define
a
connector_4
which
connector_5
from
one
folder
and
move
them
into
another
folder
while
prepending
a
pattern_2
to
each
name
connector_7
with
technology_4
dsl
to
define
a
connector_4
with
technology_4
dsl
we
will
first
need
to
create
a
defaultcamelcontext
instance
after
that
we
need
to
extend
routebuilder
and
connector_16
the
configure
which
will
contain
connector_4
flow
private

}
}
camelcontext
start

stop
}
the
configure
can
be
connector_17
this
connector_17
from
the
component_15
folder
component_17
them
with
fileprocessor
and
connector_13
the
connector_data_5
to
a
destination
folder
set
delete=true
mean
the
will
be
delete
from
component_15
folder
after
it
be
component_10
successfully
in
order
to
start
technology_2
we
need
to
connector_data_6
start
on
camelcontext
component_16
sleep
be
invoke
in
order
to
allow
technology_2
the
time
necessary
to
move
the
from

to
another
fileprocessor
connector_18

and
contain

}
in
order
to
connector_19
name
we
have
to
connector_19
an
incoming
connector_data_2
from
an
exchange
and
connector_20
it
similar
to
that
to
modify
name
we
have
to
update
connector_data_2
connector_7
with
technology_3
dsl
when
define
a
connector_4
with
technology_3
dsl
we
use
an
connector_data_3
to
set
up
our
connector_3
and
processor
this
allow
u
to
configure
connector_3
use
no
by
use
technology_3
and
ultimately
give
u
the
benefit
of
total
inversion
of
control
this
be
already
cover
in
exist
so
we
will
focus
on
use
both
technology_3
dsl
along
with
technology_4
dsl
which
be
commonly
a
prefer
way
of
define
connector_3
in
this
arrangement
camelcontext
be
define
in
technology_3
connector_data_3
use
custom
connector_data_3
syntax
for
technology_2
but
without
the
connector_4
definition
in
the
requirement_3
of
“pure”
technology_3
dsl
use

camelcontext
xmlns=

technology_1
schema
technology_3
routebuilder
ref=
filerouter
camelcontext
this
way
we
tell
technology_2
to
use
filerouter
which
hold
the
definition
of
our
connector_4
in
technology_4
dsl
filerouter
extend
routebuilder
{
private
final
source_folder

test
component_15
folder
private
final

=

test
destination
folder
@override
configure
throw
exception
{
from
+
source_folder
+
delete=true
component_10
fileprocessor
to
+
destination_folder
}
}
in
order
to
test
this
we
have
to
create
an
instance
of
classpathxmlapplicationcontext
which
will
load
up
our
camelcontext
in
technology_3
@test
movefoldercontentspringdsltest
throw
interruptedexception

classpathxmlapplicationcontext
applicationcontext
=
classpathxmlapplicationcontext
technology_2

technology_15
component_16
sleep
duration_milis
applicationcontext
close
}
by
use
this
approach
we
connector_1
additional
quality_attribute_6
and
benefit
provide
by
technology_3
a
well
a
all
the
possibility
of
technology_4
technology_11
by
use
technology_4
dsl
conclusion
in
this
quick
we
present
an
introduction
to
technology_1
technology_2
and
demonstrate
benefit
of
use
technology_2
for
requirement_1
connector_data_7
such
a
connector_7
from
one
folder
to
another
in
our
example
