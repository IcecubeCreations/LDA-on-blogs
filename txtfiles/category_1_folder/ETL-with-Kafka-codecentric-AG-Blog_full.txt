no

“etl
with
kafka”
be
a
catchy
phrase
that
i
purposely
choose
for
this
coding_keyword_1
instead
of
a
more
precise
title
“building
a
connector_data_1
pipeline
with
technology_2
connect”
tldryou
don’t
need
to
connector_1
any
for
connector_2
connector_data_1
into
technology_2
instead
choose
your
connector
and
start
the
with
your
necessary
configuration
and
it’s
open_source
technology_2
connectkafkabefore
connector_3
into
the
technology_2
connector_4
technology_4
coding_keyword_2
u
briefly
sum
up
what
technology_5
technology_2
be
in
couple
of
line
technology_5
technology_2
be
build
at
linkedin
to
meet
the
requirement
that
connector_data_2
pattern_1
already
exist
in
the
requirement_2
do
not
meet
–
requirement
such
a
quality_attribute_1
quality_attribute_2
resilient
with
low
quality_attribute_3
and
high
quality_attribute_4
currently
i
e

linkedin
be
component_2
about


petabyte
of
connector_data_1
per
day
through
technology_2
technology_2
offer
a
programmable
technology_6
for
a
lot
of
technology_7
to
produce
and
connector_5
connector_data_1
technology_2
connectkafka
connector_4
have
be
build
into
technology_5
technology_2
since
version




although
the
idea
have
be
in
existence
before
this
release
but
a
a
project
name
copycat
technology_2
connector_4
be
basically
a
technology_4
around
technology_2
to
connector_6
connector_data_1
from
different
component_3
in
and
out
of
technology_2
connector_7
into
other
component_4
e
g
technology_8
with
automatic
offset
requirement_3
where
a
a
component_5
of
the
connector
you
don’t
need
to
worry
about
this
but
rely
on
the
developer
of
the
connector
besides
that
in
discussion
i
have
often
come
across
people
who
be
think
that
technology_2
connector_4
be
part
of
the
confluent
requirement_4
and
not
a
part
of
open_source
technology_2
to
my
surprise
i
have
even
hear
it
from
a
long
term
technology_2
developer
that
confusion
might
be
due
to
the
fact
that
if
you
the
term
technology_2
connector_4
the
first
few
component_6
on
be
by
confluent
and
the
connector_data_3
of
certify
connector
technology_2
connector_4
have
basically
three
coding_keyword_3
component_7
that
need
to
be
understand
for
a
deep
understand
of
the
technology_4
connector
be
in
a
way
the
“brain”
that
determine
how
many
connector_data_4
will
run
with
the
configuration
and
how
the
work
be
divide
between
these
connector_data_5
for
example
the
technology_9
connector
can
decide
to
parallelize
the
component_2
to
connector_5
connector_data_1
from
a
component_8
see
figure

connector_data_4
contain
the
coding_keyword_3
component_9
of
connector_3
the
connector_data_1
into
technology_2
from
external
component_4
by
connector_4
e
g
to
a
component_8
component_10
connector_data_5
or
connector_8
connector_data_1
from
technology_2
and
connector_2
it
to
external
component_4
connector_7
connector_data_5
component_11
be
the
part
that
abstract
away
from
the
connector
and
connector_data_4
in
order
to
provide
a
pattern_2
component_12
coding_keyword_3
connector_9
quality_attribute_5
high
quality_attribute_6
quality_attribute_7
and
load
balance
standalonekafka
connector_4
can
be
start
in
two
different
mode
the
first
mode
be
connector_10
standalone
and
should
be
use
only
in
development
because
offset
be
be
maintain
on
the
component_13
this
would
be
really
bad
if
you
be
run
this
mode
in
production
and
your
component_14
be
unavialable
this
could
cause
the
loss
of
the
state
which
mean
the
offset
be
lose
and
you
a
a
develeoper
don’t

let’s

where
we
be
connector_3
some
real

use

conclusionin
this
coding_keyword_1
we
cover
the
high
level
component_7
that
be
the
build
block
of
the
technology_2
connector_4
technology_4
the
latter
be
a
part
of
the
technology_5
technology_2
open_source
version
that
allow
connector_data_1
engineer
or
requirement_6
department
to
move
connector_data_1
from
one
component_13
to
another
without
connector_13
any
via
technology_5
kafka’s
great
characteristic
of
which
we
barely
scratch
the
surface
in
this
