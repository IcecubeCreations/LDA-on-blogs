in
this
component_1
test

we
take
a
look
at
how
to
requirement_1
technology_1
connector_1
and
extract
connector_data_1
use
the
rest
assure
technology_2
when
test
an
technology_3
you
typically
make
a
connector_data_2
to
a
resource
e
g
via
a
connector_2
or
connector_data_2
the
component_2
come
back
with
a
connector_1
and
then
you
do
some
assertion
on
the
connector_1
how
to
requirement_1
technology_1
connector_1
for
this

i
will
be
use
jsonplaceholder
which
be
a
fake
online
pattern_1
component_1
for
test
and
prototyping
jsonplaceholder
be
a
free
online
pattern_1
component_3
that
you
can
use
whenever
you
need
some
fake
connector_data_3
more
specifically
i
will
be
use
the
component_4
jsonplaceholder
connector_data_2
and
connector_1
when
we
make
a
connector_2
connector_data_2
to
the
above
resource
we
connector_2
a
technology_1
connector_1
which
contain
a
connector_data_4
of
component_5
this
connector_data_4
be
represent
a
a

each
have
a

therefore
in
the
full
connector_1
there
will
be
ten
component_6
in
the

each
have
the
same
technology_1
connector_data_5
but
with
different
requirement_4
relate
how
to
connector_4
a
connector_data_2
with
rest
assure
how
to
requirement_1
technology_1
in
technology_4
now
let’s
start
by
requirement_1
and
extract
some
requirement_4
from
the
technology_5
the
first
test
would
typically
be
to
count
the
number
of
component_6
in
