take
any

project
and
you
have
multiple
component_2
talk
over
multiple
transport
on
multiple
component_3
a
you
can
imagine
in
large
requirement_7
component_2
this
can
connector_2
complex
very
fast
much
of
the
complexity
stem
from
two
issue
deal
with
the
specific
of
component_2
and
transport
come
up
with
quality_attribute_2
solution
to
requirement_1
problem
make
your
component_2
speak
transport
and
component_4
be
relatively
easy
on
it
own
i
m
sure
everyone

how
to
connector_3
technology_4
connector_data_1
to
their
pattern_3
of
choice
though
it
still
require
in
depth
knowledge
of
the
technology_4
specification
which
many
developer
not
have
on
top
of
that
what
happen
when
you
want
to
connector_4
that
technology_4
connector_data_2
to
another
component_5
you
then
have
to
take
care
of
connector_data_3
the
technology_4
connector_data_2
to
the
component_5
plus
handle
any
concept
relate
to
the
component_5
a
dozen
other
component_2
into
the
mix
and
you
ve
connector_2
quite
a
headache
on
your
hand
ignore
the
mechanic
of
how
to
connector_5
with
multiple
transport
and
apis
we
can
focus
on
the
high
level
design
of
how
component_2
connector_6
fortunately
most
solution
to
requirement_7
requirement_1
problem
have
be
formalize
already
gregor
hohpe
and
bobby
woolfe
s
book
requirement_7
requirement_1
pattern_4
design
build
and
quality_attribute_3
pattern_5
solution
boil
down
year
of
experience
from
requirement_7
architect
into
a
set
of
sixty
five
requirement_7
requirement_1
pattern_4
eips
this
be
great
but
we
still
have
to
hand

all
part
of
these
pattern_4
these
be
not
packaged
solution
only
recommendation
technology_1
technology_2
be
create
with
the
intention
of
connector_7
these
two
issue
in
this

i
ll
first
give
you
a
quick
overview
of
what
technology_2
be
i’ll
then
guide
you
through
how
technology_2
solve
a
sample
requirement_1
problem
finally
i’ll
show
off
some
graphical
technology_5
that
make
it
even
easy
to
solve
requirement_1
problem
with
technology_2
what
be
technology_2
technology_1
technology_2
be
an
open_source
technology_3
technology_6
that
focus
on
make
requirement_1
easy
and
more
quality_attribute_4
to
developer
it
do
this
by
provide
concrete
implementation
of
all
the
widely
use
eips
connector_8
to
a
great
variety
of
transport
and
component_4
easy
to
use
domain
specific
technology_7
dsl
to
wire
eips
and
transport
together
figure

show
how
these
three
connector_data_4
actually
connector_data_3
to
technology_2
concept
to
give
you
a
quality_attribute_2
understand
of
how
technology_2
be
organize
we
will
discus
component_6

processor
and
dsl
there
be
of

a
lot
more
go
on
here
under
the
hood
but
we
ll
leave
that
for
another
discussion
figure

high
level
pattern_1
of
technology_2
s
architecture
from
technology_2
in
action
component_7
be
the
extension
point
in
technology_2
to
connector_8
to
other
component_8
the
core
of
technology_2
be
very
small
to
keep
connector_9
low
promote
embeddability
etc
and
a
a
connector_data_5
contain
only

essential
component_6
there
be
over

component_7
outside
the
core
to
connector_10
these
component_9
to
the
rest
of
technology_2
component_7
provide
an

by
use
uris
you
can
connector_3
or
connector_11
connector_data_1
on
in
a
uniform
way
for
instance
to
connector_11
connector_data_1
from
a
technology_4
component_10
aqueue
and
connector_3
them
to
a
component_8
directory
tmp
you
could
use
uris
technology_8
aqueue
and

tmp
processor
be
use
to
manipulate
and
mediate
connector_data_1
between

all
of
the
eips
be
define
a
processor
or
set
of
processor
a
of
connector_12
technology_2
support
over

pattern_4
from
the
eip
book
and
many
other
useful
processor
to
wire
processor
and
together
technology_2
define
multiple
dsl
in
regular
programming
technology_7
such
a
technology_3
technology_9
and
technology_10
it
also
allow
connector_13
rule
to
be
specify
in
technology_11
here
be
some
dsl
example
use
different
technology_7
and
stay
functionally
equivalent
technology_3
dsl
from

tmp
to
technology_8
aqueue
technology_12
dsl
connector_4
from
uri=

tmp
to
uri=
technology_8
aqueue
connector_4
technology_13
dsl
from

tmp
technology_8
aqueue
in
all
the
above
example
we
define
a
connector_13
rule
that
will
load
in
the
“
tmp”
directory
into
memory
create
a
technology_4
connector_data_2
with
the
content
and
connector_3
that
connector_data_2
to
a
technology_4
component_10
name
aqueue
these
be
the
concept
that
technology_2
be
build
upon
since
then
many
other
interest
feature
have
be

i
recommend
connector_14
technology_2
in
action
by
claus
ibsen
and
myself
to
really
connector_2
the
full
picture
of
what
technology_2
can
do
but
to
connector_2
you
start
some
of
these
extra
feature
include
pluggable
connector_data_6
technology_14
and
type
converter
for
easy
connector_data_2
transformation
between
csv
edi
flatpack
hl7
technology_15
technology_16
xmlbeans
xstream
zip
etc
pluggable
technology_7
to
create
expression
or
predicate
for
use
in
the
dsl
some
of
these
technology_7
include
technology_17
jxpath
mvel
ognl
beanshell
technology_18
technology_10
technology_19
technology_20
technology_21
technology_22
technology_23
technology_24
etc
support
for
the
requirement_1
of
component_11
and
pojos
in
various
place
in
technology_2
excellent
support
for
test
quality_attribute_5
and
pattern_6
component_9
use
a
pattern_5
approach
and
much
more
introduce
rider
auto
part
the
example
in
this
be
base
on
a
fictional
motorcycle
part
requirement_8
use
throughout
the
technology_2

connector_15
to
technology_11
currently
they
provide
a
through
which
order
be
submit
a
connector_data_7
connector_data_1
over
technology_26
rider
auto
part
ask
requirement_11
to
use
the
web
to
place
order
but
because
of
component_13
level
agreement
slas
with
exist
requirement_11
they
must
keep
all
the
old
connector_data_2
technology_14
and
up
and
run
all
of
these
connector_data_1
be
convert
to
an
internal
plain
old
technology_3
connector_data_8
pojo
technology_14
before
component_14
a
high
level
pattern_1
of
the
order
component_14

be
show
in
figure

figure

high
level
pattern_1
of
order
component_14
at
rider
auto
part
from
technology_2
in
action
we
need
to
find
out
the
best
way
to
connector_17
the
“rider
order
frontend”
in
figure

above
let’s
first
see
how
this
look
use
notation
from
the
requirement_7
requirement_1
pattern_4
book
solution
use
eips
rider
auto
part
face
a
pretty
common
problem
over
year
of
requirement_8
acquire
baggage
in
the
form
of
transport
connector_data_6
technology_14
that
be
popular
at
the
time
use
pattern_4
from
the
eip
book
we
can
envision
the
solution
a
something
figure

figure

this
show
the
solution
to
rider
auto
part
requirement_1
problem
use
notation
from
the
requirement_7
requirement_1
pattern_4
book
so
we
have
several
pattern_4
in
use
here
there
be
two
connector_data_2

one
for
technology_25
connector_8
and
another
for
technology_26
connector_data_1
from
these
be
feed
into
the
incomingorders
connector_data_2
pattern_7
the
connector_data_1
be
connector_18
from
the
incomingorders
connector_data_2
pattern_7
and
connector_19
by
a
content
base
pattern_8
to
one
of
two
connector_data_2
pattern_9
a
the
eip
name
imply
the
connector_13
destination
quality_attribute_6
on
the
content
of
the
connector_data_2
in
this
requirement_12
we
need
to
connector_4
base
on
whether
the
content
be
a
csv
or
connector_data_7

both
connector_data_2
pattern_9
convert
the
connector_data_2
content
into
a
pojo
which
be
feed
into
the
order
connector_data_2
pattern_7
the
whole
section
that
us
a
content
base
pattern_8
and
several
connector_data_2
pattern_9
be
refer
to
a
a
normalizer
this
composite
pattern_4
have
a
unique
graphic
to
depict
it
but
be
leave
out
here
in
favor
of
it
sub
pattern_4
to
make
thing
clear
implementation
use
technology_2
a
mention
before
technology_2
have
a
small
core
set
of
component_7
include
by
default
the
rest
of
the
component_7
exist
a
separate

in
component_2
that
require
many
type
of
connector_8
it
be
useful
to
figure
out
what
technology_2
to
include
connector_data_9

show
the
connector_9
use
technology_1
technology_27
for
the
technology_2
implementation
of
the
rider
auto
part
example
of

you

t
need
to
use
technology_1
technology_27
for
connector_9
it
be
the
easy
way
to
rapidly
connector_9
to
your
component_5
the
connector_data_9
of
connector_9
include
support
for
core
technology_2
technology_28
technology_15
marshal
csv
marshal
and
technology_26
to
make
the
example
easy
to
try
out
i
ve
opt
to
use
the
instead
of
the
technology_25
if
we
be
use
the
technology_25

we
would
need
to
a
connector_9
on
the

while
it
be

it
be
often
useful

in

we

for
the

pojo
and
technology_27
build

fit
neatly

this

in

there
be
a

of
extra
thing
to
mention
first
off
the
technology_26
component_18
will
be
expect
a
connector_22
from
the

so
we

we
have

each
connector_22
be
determine

in

we
use
the

to
set
the

to
the
constant
coding_keyword_5
ok
since
we
handle
the
connector_22
ourselves
we
don’t
want
any
connector_22
to
come
from
the
technology_4
incomingorders
component_10
to
connector_3
to
this
component_10
in

fashion
we
use
the

rather
than
the

the

specify
the

use
fuse
ide
for
technology_2
a
we’ve
see
technology_1
technology_2
certainly
make
it
easy
to
create
requirement_1
the
dsl
in
various
technology_7
be
design
to
be
concise
powerful
and
easy
to
connector_29
–
all
with
the
goal
of
make
you
the
developer
more
productive
with
improve
productivity
in
mind
fusesource
have
create
an
ide
for
technology_2
development
connector_30
fuse
ide
for
technology_2
fuse
ide
be
an
eclipse
base
technology_5
that
allow
you
to
drag
and
drop
requirement_7
requirement_1
pattern_4
eip
icon
onto
a
canvas
and
connector_5
them
together
to
form
connector_13
rule
the
backend
of
the
ide
generate
technology_2
connector_13
rule
in
technology_12
connector_data_7
for
you
so
you
don’t
ever
have
to
the
specific
of
camel’s
dsl
essentially
you
can
create
a
picture
figure

and
have
fuse
ide
generate
the
technology_2
component_5
for
you
figure

show
what
the
fuse
ide
designer
look
when
we
load
our
example
configuration
from
connector_data_9

figure

technology_12
connector_data_7
in
connector_data_9

load
into
fuse
ide’s
designer
from
the
designer
pattern_1
we
can
see
the
graphical
representation
of
each
of
the
connector_19
we
create
in
technology_12
connector_data_7
beforehand
from
this
point
we
can
connector_15
how
the
eip
icon
be
connector_5
uri
property
additional
step
to
the
connector_19
and
so
on
also
a
of
version


fuse
ide
will
support
all
eips
and
component_7
quality_attribute_8
in
technology_1
technology_2
—
so
there
be
no
wait
for
version


to
use
your
favorite
technology_2
feature
in
this

we
start
first
by
create
the
technology_12
connector_data_7
configuration
by
hand
this
should
not
mislead
you
however
there
be
no
requirement
to
do
this
in
fact
since
fuse
ide
support

to

round
trip
between
technology_2
technology_12
connector_data_7
configuration
and
the
designer
pattern_1
you
can
use
whichever
you
prefer
when
you
have
finish
construct
your
connector_19
you
can
then
take
advantage
of
another
neat
feature
include
in
fuse
ide
that
be
the
ability
to
generate
a
junit
test
requirement_12
from
any
technology_2
technology_12
connector_data_7

once
you
be
satisfy
with
your
test
you
can
then
debug
in
a
local
technology_12
container
or
quality_attribute_3
to
your
container
of
choice
—
all
from
within
the
ide
of

much
more
be
plan
for
fuse
ide
in
the
future
so
technology_2
development
will
only
connector_2
easy
summary
in
this

i
ve
show
two
common
problem
that
an
requirement_1
developer
face
deal
with
the
specific
of
component_2
and
transport
and
come
up
with
quality_attribute_2
solution
to
requirement_1
problem
the
technology_1
technology_2
project
provide
a
nice
answer
to
both
of
these
problem
a
the
example
have
show
solve
requirement_1
problem
with
technology_2
be
straight
connector_31
and
connector_data_11
in
very
concise
connector_4
definition
build
on
that
we
