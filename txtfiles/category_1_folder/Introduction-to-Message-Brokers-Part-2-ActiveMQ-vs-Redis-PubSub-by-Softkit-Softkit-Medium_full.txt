take

and
what
they

do
in

previous
overview

we
be
talk

now
let’s
take
a
look
at
the

still
very
helpful

we

these

usually
prefer
this
quality_attribute_2
and
quality_attribute_3
open_source
solution
the
connector_data_1
pattern_1
have
become
popular
due
to
it
quality_attribute_4
and
quality_attribute_5
with
many
technology_12
and
advance

the
story
of
technology_1
developmentat
the
begin
of
technology_1
development
there
be
two
reason
to
start
out
the
project
the
high
requirement_5
of
the
most
popular
pattern_3
technology_6
of
those
time
the
necessity
of
work
on

opportunity
for

developer
the
component_1
be
base
on
the
technology_16
technology_17
specification
and
support
pattern_4
connector_3
so
it
allow
the
programmer
to
organize
fast
and
quality_attribute_8
pattern_3
component_2
within
requirement_6
project
i
can
define
three
key
advantage
of
the

can
combine
technology_1
with
other
mainstream
pattern_3
technology_6
namely
quality_attribute_2
component_3
component_6
technology_3
technology_4
and
technology_5
in
addition
there
be

work
fast
and
help
to
use
requirement_6
requirement_8
pattern_5
and
other
modern
solution
at
the
same
time
it’s
quite
easy
to
connector_6
and
connector_7
use
to
quality_attribute_2
configuration
of
the
connector_data_1
pattern_1
be
an
important
advantage

the

be

it’s
a

where
there
be
only

component_12
the
second
be
a
topic
which
be
include

pattern_3
and
imply
the
involvement
of
several
component_12
the
ability
to
use

type
of
pattern_3
be
also
a
great
benefit
use
a
single
connector_data_1
pattern_1
for
both
component_4
and
topic
give
the
programmer
additional
quality_attribute_10

it
so
the

be

the

it’s
no

when
a

this

component_16
don’t
need

so
the

connector_data_4
be
very
