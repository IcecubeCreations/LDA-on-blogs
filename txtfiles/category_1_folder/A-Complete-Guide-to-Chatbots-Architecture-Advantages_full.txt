chatbots
usually
represent

how
to
choose
the
right
requirement_5

there
be
many
component_6

for
you
in

base
on
the
use
requirement_11
you

you
can
opt
for
some
requirement_5

which
be
appropriate
to
your
component_4
to
achieve
the
require

have
an
understand
of

such
a
semantic
natural
technology_2
component_12
and
requirement_3
be
suggest
a
the
best
option
so
that
you
can
evaluate
them
for
your
desire
goal
how
chatbots
work
chatbots
respond
base
on
component_3
input
the
look
easy
but
while
connector_10
it
thing
connector_11
quite
complex
or
difficult
connector_data_6
perform
by
them
the
primary
focus
be
to
identify
the
user’s
connector_data_3
and
extract
connector_data_7
that
be
relevant
if
a
requirement_5
can
t
understand
the
user’s
connector_data_3
it
can’t
answer
accurately
the
connector_12
can
be
the
connector_data_7
be
component_13
in
requirement_12
requirement_8
component_8
a
text
connector_13
from
a
knowledge
base
a
predefined
and
generic
text
the
connector_data_5
obtain
by
connector_14
with
one
or
more
back
end
component_4
a
contextualized
connector_data_4
provide
by
the
component_3
chatbots
architecture
a
requirement_5
that
answer
a
user’s
connector_data_3
should
be
smart
enough
so
that
it
can
engage
the
component_3
to
continue
the
conversation
it
doesn
t
have
to
remember
all
the
conversational
detail
there
be
different
component_14
involve
in
the
architecture
of
requirement_6
the
choice
of
architecture
quality_attribute_5
on
the
component_15
you
choose
requirement_6
be
classify
into
entertainment
requirement_6
requirement_8
requirement_6
entertainment
requirement_6
one
way
to
ass
these
requirement_6
be
the
turing
test
i
e
compare
them
with
human
and
the
other
way
be
metric
quantitative
assess
the
minimum
length
of
conversation
between
the
requirement_6
and
the
component_3
and
maximum
time
spend
by
a
component_3
base
on
the
metric
we
can
decide
what
kind
of
a
requirement_6
be
it
for
example
if
conversation
be
find
to
be
short
then
the
requirement_6
be
not
consider
an
entertain
one
requirement_8
requirement_6
often
requirement_8
be
pattern_2
and
have
a
specific
purpose
in
this
kind
of
requirement_5
the
conversation
be
focus
much
on
users’
need
for
example
chatbots
develop
by
travel
requirement_8
requirement_13
trivago
makemytrip
goibibo
will
provide
connector_data_4
about
hotel
flight
tour
and
help
in
find
the
best
package
accord
to
component_3
preference
the
example
of
requirement_8
requirement_6
we
regularly
use
be
uber
requirement_6
take
a
ride
connector_data_3
assistant
readily
provide
connector_data_4
connector_data_3
and
so
on
each
conversation
have
a
goal
conversation
usually
be
short
i
e
le
than


minute
have
say
that
the
quality
of
a
requirement_6
metric
can
be
measure
base
on
a
number
of
component_16
who
reach
the
goal
whether
the
component_3
find
the
connector_data_4
he
she
be
look
for
be
the
book
successful
or
not
have
the
component_3
buy
technology_4
with
proper
guidance
the
majority
of
requirement_6
come
under
the
above
classification
there
be
other
classification
a
well
for
example
base
on
the
type
of
conversation
chatbots
be
classify
into
one
to
one
and
one
to
many
if
requirement_6
be

into
a
group
chat
then
it
become
complex
and
the
dynamic
of
conversation
connector_15
requirement_2
component_14
there
be
three
type
of
component_14
in
develop
chatbots
retrieval
base
component_14
pattern_3
base
heuristic
generative
component_14
retrieval
base
component_15
these
component_14
be
much
easy
to
build
and
give
more
quality_attribute_6
connector_12
these
be
not
100%
quality_attribute_7
in
provide
connector_12
but
you
need
to
make
sure
that
there
be
no
grammatical
mistake
in
connector_12
these
be
more
practical
and
many
algorithm
and
component_17
be
quality_attribute_4
for
developer
they
make
use
of
component_18
in
the
conversation
for
select
the
best
connector_12
from
a
predefined
connector_data_8
of
connector_data_9
that
they
connector_11
train
the
component_18
include
all
previous
connector_data_9
of
conversation
and
early
connector_16
variable
the
requirement_6
that
doesn’t
use
component_18
be
stateless
so
it
will
provide
a
connector_12
only
to
the
late
component_3
s
connector_data_1
omit
all
the
previous
chat
history
of
the
conversation
pattern_3
base
heuristic
these
be
for
choose
a
connector_12
and
they
can
be
do
in
many
way
base
on
requirement_3
classifier
to
quality_attribute_8
if
else
logical
condition
here
uncomplicated
technology_6
be
use
to
set
rule
use
pattern_3
this
type
of
component_15
be
very
popular
for
entertainment
requirement_6
requirement_2
and
ml
programming
technology_2
be
widely
use
for
connector_12
template
and
connector_17
pattern_3
developer
connector_18
use
both
these
technology_2
and
can
have
multiple
unit
when
a
developer
connector_19
any
connector_data_1
it
connector_20
all
the
pattern_3
till
it
find
a
correct
pattern_3
which
exactly
or
nearly
match
the
component_3
connector_data_1
if
the
match
be
find
then
it
choose
that
template
to
generate
the
connector_12
chatscripts
be
the
modern
implementation
of
this
kind
it
be
an
open
component_19
requirement_5

that
allow

generative
component_15
these
component_14
be
the
base
for
future
chatbots
and
they
make
them
smart
and
more
interactive
these
component_14
be
not
widely
in
use
and
be
mostly
in
the
develop
stage
architecture
with
connector_12
selection
a
requirement_5
can
connector_21
the
same
connector_data_1
through
different
word
for
example
a
weather
requirement_6
that
can
predict
connector_12
in
different
way
to
different
component_16
“it’s
go
to
rain”
“do
carry
an
umbrella
today”
“probability
of
rain
be
50%”
now
predict
which
one
will
be
best
for
the
component_3
quality_attribute_5
upon
whether
the
technology_2
or
the
user’s
input
a
different
component_16
prefer
vary
style
of
connector_12
requirement_6
analyze
the
previous
connector_data_7
and
metric
to
produce
connector_12
to
the
component_3
they
can
have
independent
connector_12
selection
and
connector_12
generation

component_12
the
connector_data_1
start
from
understand
“what
the
component_3
be
talk
about
”
generally
more
sophisticate
requirement_6
identify
multiple
intent
in
a
connector_data_1
intent
classification
make
use
of
component_18
connector_data_4
component_3
profile

and
previous

the
weather
requirement_6
can
connector_22
the

candidate
connector_12
generator
it
do
all
the
domain
specific
calculation
require
to
component_12
the
component_3
connector_data_3
it
make
use
of
different
algorithm
by
connector_23
few
external
component_17
or
even
take
the
help
of
human
to
generate
connector_12
the
final
connector_data_5
of
these
calculation
be
connector_data_8
a
connector_12
candidate
these
connector_12
must
be
quality_attribute_7
accord
to
domain
specific
component_21
it
can’t
be
a
set
of
random
connector_12
connector_12
generator
should
use

the
component_18
of
the
conversation
a
well
a
component_22
that
be
extract
from
the
previous
component_3
connector_data_1
or
else
it
can’t
support
group
conversation
the
role
of
the
connector_12
selector
be
to
rank
all
the
connector_12
candidate
and
select
a
connector_12
that
best
suit
the
user’s
connector_data_3
chatbots
in
the
requirement_8
currently
there
be
a
constant
focus
on
improve
the
ability
of
chatbots
to
imitate
the
use
of
speech
and
mean
the
best
example
be
“cleverbot”
we
be
in
an
era
where
component_9
be
always
connector_24
to
social

component_6
through
smart
component_23
the
generation
of
component_9
expect
a
quick
and
supportive
requirement_14
component_11
experience
from
various
brand
they
demand
quick
connector_12
that
be
more
personalize
with
recommendation
to
fulfill
their
demand
and
to
connector_3
the
heavy
competition
in
the
requirement_8
world
they
focus
to
build
chatbots
that
can
manage
requirement_14
connector_25
24*7
without
any
delay
the
reality
be
that
they
engage
the
component_9
at
the
right
time
with
the
appropriate
connector_data_4
which
be
cost
quality_attribute_9
it
act
a
an
between
requirement_14
and
brand
and
build
trust
in
them
how
advancement
in
requirement_2
impact
chatbots
till
now
chatbots
haven
t
pass
the
turing
test
but
there
be
a
development
in
requirement_2
technology_6
connector_data_7
have
become
le
complicate
and
the
key
for
that
be
to
find
use
requirement_11
from
where
we
can
connector_11
a
huge
volume
of
iteration
repetition
so
the
component_8
can
iterate
a
fast
a
possible
to
improve
itself
in
the
development
of
a
requirement_5
this
be
the
coding_keyword_1
advantage
a
it
can
perform
a
massive
level
of
conversation
still
research
be
under
component_12
about
the
evaluation
of
the
connector_12
we
can
predict
that
in
the
year
to
come
we
will
see
more
advance
requirement_2
technique
come
into
the
limelight
that
can
provide
more
innovative
feature
the
conversational
capability
of
chatbots
be
always
the
coding_keyword_1
motto
type
of
chatbots
follow
be
different
type
of
chatbots
differentiate
base
on
their
feature
scripted
chatbots
this
type
of
chatbots
follow
predefined
conversation
path
at
every
step
of
the
conversation
the
component_3
have
to
select
from
the
give
option
to
decide
the
next
step
of
the
conversation
the
option
be
give
to
the
component_3
at
every
step
of
the
conversation
to
choose
either
touch
text
or
voice
connector_12
base
on
the
feature
of
the
chat
component_24
you
use
and
the
way
the
requirement_6
be
design
and
component_25
intelligent
chatbots
requirement_2
allow
quality_attribute_10
in
term
of
the
input
from
component_16
that
be
acceptable
they
take
free
input
in
the
form
of
text
and
voice
statement
however
requirement_2
work
well
with
limit
knowledge
domain
set
or
instruction
a
the
actual
intelligence
be
limit
it
be
highly
difficult
for
a
requirement_6
to
“understand”
ambiguity
or
a
useful
memory
that
impact
connector_7
component_4
chatbots
both
intelligent
and
scripted
chatbots
have
graphical
component_3
gui
component_4
requirement_6
be
a
combination
of
both
intelligent
and
scripted
requirement_6
requirement_5
developer
need
to
understand
the
fact
that
the
requirement_6
connector_8
use
a
graphical
component_3

if
a
component_3
have
to
do
the

then
he
need
to
do
it
more
efficiently
than
the
requirement_6
through
a
graphical
component_3

use
requirement_11
chatbots
be
use
in
different
way
that
be
why
it’s
difficult
to
define
what
they
be
it
be
possible
to
connector_18
a
use
requirement_11
for
a
requirement_5
for
every
single
requirement_8
or
organization
which
us
component_5
or
a

example
of
requirement_5
component_26
with
possibility
be
to
connector_11
a
quick
connector_12
to
query
to
solve
problem
or
complaint
etc
chatbots
which
be
currently
in
use
all
the
below
chatbots
allow
the
involvement
of
human
agent
in
the
conversation
if
require
maybe
a
a
premium
component_11
restaurant
have
a
takeaway
facility
where
requirement_14
order
through
a
requirement_5
either
in
the
component_13
or
from
home
the
best
example
for
this
kind
of
requirement_6
be
online
food
order
component_5
such
a
swiggy
and
zomato
requirement_10
or
campaign
sit
that
promote
their
technology_4
by
conduct
a
quiz
to
their
requirement_14
and
allow
them
to
play
the
quiz
use
a
requirement_5
chatbots
help
requirement_14
to
purchase
through
e
commerce
component_5
such
a
flipkart

and
many
more
a
requirement_5
that
respond
to
requirement_14
component_11
inquiry
and
help
them
in
perform
various
connector_data_6
they
be
use
in
pattern_4
requirement_14
satisfaction
they
be
use
in
airway
to
book
flight
and
connector_6
connector_data_4
that
be
relevant
when
they
be
in
the
airport
advantage
of
chatbots
the
advantage
of
chatbots
be
a
follow
they
be
capable
of
engage
requirement_14
in
a
friendly
manner
a
quality_attribute_8
make
it
easy
to
connector_8
connector_26
be
make
possible
via
social

component_6
twitter
chat
through
component_4
programming
apis
they
have
extraordinary
capability
in
handle
requirement_14
query
work
efficiently
round
the
clock
for
requirement_14
component_11
cost
quality_attribute_11
and
be
easy
to
build
future
scope
the
use
of
chatbots
have
certainly
gain
strength
over
the
past
few
year
at
present
it
appear
that
virtual
reality
and
augment
reality
will
play
an
important
role
in
development
therefore
chatbots
will
definitely
have
a
role
to
play
here
especially
in
voice

there
be
no
doubt
that
they
be
go
to
be
the
future
when
more
and
more
requirement_13
start
develop
component_17
to
quality_attribute_12
chatbots
within
their
ecosystem
for
connector_7
then
there
exist
a
demand
for
requirement_6
that
can
connector_8
among
multiple
component_24
therefore
we
can
expect
a
rise
in
sdks
and
technology_7
that
help
developer
in
build
technology_8
drive
voice
requirement_6
requirement_13
be
now
expect
to
engage
requirement_6
to
converse
in
the
same
way
that
requirement_14
would
to
connector_27
with
their
family
member
friend
and
even
colleague
since
the
maximum
number
of
requirement_6
be
train
by
a
strengthen
voice
to
text
and
natural
technology_2
component_12
nlp
which
can
be
apply
to
any
for
connector_7
many
brand
for
example
messenger
whatsapp
voice
chat
or
pattern_1
now
have
an
opportunity
to
offer
the
choice
of
prefer
pattern_1
pattern_5
for
their
requirement_14
chatbots
have
buy
a
revolution
in
term
of
connector_7
and
the
way
of
connector_26
have
entirely
connector_15
requirement_13
have
inculcate
these
to
establish
a
conversation
