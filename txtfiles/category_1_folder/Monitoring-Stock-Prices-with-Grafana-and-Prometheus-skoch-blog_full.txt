in
this
i
will
show
you
how
you
can
do
long
term
pattern_1
of
requirement_1
requirement_2
with
grafana
and
connector_1
alert
when
your
requirement_1
rise
above
or
fall
below
a
certain
threshold
this
can
help
you
to
keep
an
eye
on
your
requirement_1
even
if
you
do
not
want
to
connector_2
the
requirement_6
every
day
there
have
be
quite
some
interest
in
my
previous
about
pattern_1
of
requirement_1
proces
with
prometheus
and
molescrape
since
molescrape
be
in
no
state
where
it
can
be
use
by
the
wide
coding_keyword_1
this
time
i
want
to
show
you
how
you
can
do
requirement_1
pattern_1
with
a
quality_attribute_1
custom
technology_5
script
we
will
use
grafana
for
the
visualisation
and
alert
prometheus
only
a
a
connector_data_1
storage
and
a
custom
technology_5
script
to
connector_3
the
requirement_1
connector_data_1
if
you
prefer
any
other
backend
than
prometheus
of
you
can
also
use
another
backend
support
by
grafana
e
g
graphite
influxdb
technology_8
technology_9
and
many
more
before
we
start
we
have
to
remember
that
there
be
two
way
how
we
can
connector_1
connector_data_1
into
prometheus
either
prometheus
can
connector_4
it
from
a
run
component_3
or
we
can
connector_5
it
into
the
prometheus
connector_5
gateway
which
be
a
pattern_2
provide
a
component_3
to
prometheus
to
connector_4
from
one
disadvantage
about
the
connector_5
gateway
be
that
it
do
not
automatically
forget
about
connector_5
metric
this
mean
that
our
script
have
to
make
sure
to
manually
delete
old
metric
when
it
cannot
find
connector_data_1
for
a
requirement_1
requirement_2
anymore
otherwise
the
requirement_1
requirement_2
will
remain
in
the
connector_5
gateway
forever
and
we
will
think
that
the
requirement_2
be
still
the
same
and
everything
be
ok

this
we
can
start
to
connector_6
a
quality_attribute_1
technology_5
script
that
scrap
the
connector_data_1
from
any
connector_data_1
component_4
we
want
i
will
not
go
into
detail
about
any
specific
here
choose
any
you
consider
appropriate
for
your
requirement_1
i
e
probably
from
your
own
country
letâs
start
with
a
connector_data_2
of
url
we
want
to
scrape
and
iterate
over
them

you
still

with

line
we
can
already
query
the
requirement_1
requirement_2
for
the

we
own
or
want
to
pattern_3
next
we
have
to
connector_1
the
connector_data_1
into
prometheus
i
expect
you
already
have
prometheus
and
the
prometheus

instal
and
they
be

to

we
can

an

i
will
do
the

since
thatâs
what
quality_attribute_1

any

in

we

connector_data_1
accord
to
my
knowledge
itâs
only
possible
to
delete
all
connector_data_1
under
a
grouping

so
we
should
delete
all

be
already
configure
to
scrape
the
connector_5
gateway
you
will
see
your
metric
in
prometheus
in
the
next
few
minute
you
can
make
sure
that
prometheus
scrap
the
connector_5
gateway
by
connector_12
whether
the
follow
section
be
a
scrape
target
in
your
prometheus
configuration
job_name

static_configs
target
localhost

finally
we
can
a
panel
in
grafana
and
connector_13
the
connector_data_1
from
our
label
with
stock_price{sym=
googl
}
for
alerting
you
must
first
create
a
connector_data_7
pattern_5
i
have
a
setup
an
e
mail
connector_data_7
pattern_5
but
you
can
also
have
other
connector_data_7
pattern_5
telegram
messenger
go
back
to
the
panel
of
your
requirement_1
and
switch
to
the
alert
tab
there
you
can
now
create
an
alert
to
connector_1
inform
once
the
requirement_1
cross
a
define
threshold
i
usually
use
the
outside
range
option
and
define
both
an
upper
and
a
lower
threshold
that
way
i
can
keep
an
eye
on
my
requirement_1
without
have
to
manually
watch
them
each
day
finally
one
more
metric
we
might
want
to
watch
be
push_time_seconds
this
metric
can
show
u
when
any
connector_data_1
for
our
grouping
key
be
last
connector_5
successfully
to
the
connector_5
gateway
this
help
u
to
determine
whether
our
script
run
at
all
thatâs
important
because
if
the
script
do
not
run
at
all
it
also
do
not
delete
old
connector_data_1
and
grafana
will
show
fine
requirement_1
requirement_2
so
create
a
panel
with
the
query
time
push_time_seconds{exported_job=
requirement_1
connector_data_1
}
this
will
give
u
the
number
of
second
since
the
last
successful
connector_5
set
an
alert
to
a
bit
high
than
the
interval

your
script
