the
technology_1
technology_11
be
one
of
the
most
popular
technology_11
to
transfer
and
exchange
connector_data_1
on
the
web
almost
all
pattern_3
web
component_1
take
technology_1
input
and
provide
technology_1
output
but
unfortunately
jdk
doesn
t
have
build
in
support
for
one
of
the
most
common
web
technology_12
technology_13
a
a
technology_3
developer
if
you
want
to
develop
a
pattern_3
web
component_2
and
produce
technology_1
connector_data_1
or
if
you
be
develop
a
component_3
to
exist
restful
web
component_1
and
want
to
connector_2
technology_1
connector_3
you
t
need
to
be
disappoint
fortunately
there
be
so
many
open_source
technology_2
and
component_4
quality_attribute_1
for
create
requirement_1
and
component_5
technology_1
connector_3
in
technology_3
technology_14
technology_15
technology_13
quality_attribute_2
etc
actually
there
be
numerous
technology_1
technology_2
that
exist
in
technology_3
but
you
t
need
to
all
of
them
one
of
them
technology_14
should
be
enough
but
on
the
other
hand
it
s
worth
what
be
some
of
the
most
popular
technology_1
requirement_1
technology_2
exist
in
your
disposal
in
this
i
be
go
to
connector_4
useful
technology_1
technology_2
that
i
believe
every
technology_3
jee
developer
should
be
aware
of
if
you
be
to
technology_13
probably
hear
about
it
but
t
what
be
technology_1
there
here
be
a
brief
introduction
of
technology_1
for
you
the
technology_1
be
an
acronym
for
technology_16
connector_data_4
notation
be
a
lightweight
connector_data_1
interchange
technology_11
an
alternative
to
technology_17
but
small
fast
and
easy
to
requirement_1
because
technology_1
u
the
technology_16
syntax
for
describe
connector_data_1
connector_data_4
it
be
technology_18
and
component_6
independent
and
many
requirement_2
and
technology_2
have
be
develop
over
the
year
you
can
also
connector_5
technology_3
connector_data_3
and
technology_1
to
more
about
the
pro
and
con
of
technology_1
over
technology_17
and
if
you
be
to
technology_1
requirement_1
in
technology_3
then
i
highly
recommend
you
connector_6
out
technology_14
technology_2
it
s
a
very
useful
versatile
and
high
requirement_3
technology_2
for
requirement_1
technology_1
and
csv
and
i
think
every
technology_3
developer
should
about
it
if
you
need
a
resource
connector_6
out
this
technology_14
quick
start
technology_1
serialization
with
technology_3
make
easy
a
free
on
udemy
to
technology_14
component_7
basic
useful
technology_1
technology_2
in
technology_3
here
be
my
connector_data_5
of
the
most
useful
and
essential
technology_1
technology_2
for
technology_3
developer
though
i
have
use
them
some
or
other
time
or
other
i
mostly
prefer
technology_14
because
it
s
feature
rich
and
i
believe
inconsistency
it
doesn
t
mean
those
other
technology_2
be
not
useful
they
also
have
their
own
strength
technology_15
be
much
quality_attribute_2
to
use
a
compare
to
technology_14
and
technology_13
quality_attribute_2
be
a
really
light
weight
technology_2
without
any
third
party
connector_7
a
the
purpose
of
this
be
to
make
you
a
technology_3
developer
aware
of
useful
technology_1
technology_2
i
leave
the
decision
of
choose
the
technology_1
technology_2
for
yourself
quality_attribute_3
upon
your
need
you
can
choose
any
of
them
technology_14
technology_14
be
a
multi
purpose
technology_3
technology_2
for
component_5
technology_1
connector_data_1
technology_11
technology_14
aim
to
be
the
best
possible
combination
of
fast
correct
lightweight
and
ergonomic
for
developer
technology_14
offer
three
for
component_5
technology_1
technology_11
each
of
them
have
it
pro
and
con
connector_8
component_7
or
incremental
requirement_1
generation
connector_9
and
connector_10
technology_1
content
a
discrete
tree
component_8
provide
a
mutable
in
memory
tree
representation
of
a
technology_1
document
connector_data_1
bind
convert
technology_1
to
and
from
pojo’s
if
you
be
only
interest
in
convert
technology_3
connector_data_6
to
and
from
technology_1
then
the
third
be
most
appropriate
for
you
the
pro
of
technology_14
be
that
it
provide
heap
of
feature
and
look
to
be
a
quality_attribute_4
technology_19
for
connector_11
and
connector_12
technology_1
in
a
variety
of
way
but
at
the
same
time
it
size
become
a
disadvantage
if
your
requirement
be
to
serialize
and
deserialize
technology_3
connector_data_4
to
technology_1
y
in
order
to
use
technology_14
you
can
include
the
follow
technology_20
connector_7
or
manually
include
technology_14
core
jar
technology_14
databind
jar
and
technology_14
annotation
jar
in
classpath
if
you
be
serious
about
pattern_2
component_7
then
you
can
also
connector_6
out
master
technology_3
web
component_1
and
pattern_2
component_7
with
technology_4
on
udemy
it
s
a
great
to
start
with
technology_3
web
component_2
particularly
pattern_2
component_7
with
technology_4
technology_15
the
second
technology_3
technology_1
bind
technology_2
we
will
discus
be
technology_15
or
if
you
prefer
the
full
name
the
technology_15
technology_2
technology_15
be
a
technology_3
technology_2
capable
of
convert
technology_3
connector_data_6
into
their
technology_1
representation
and
technology_1
to
an
equivalent
technology_3
connector_data_4
without
the
need
for
place
technology_3
annotation
in
your
some
of
the
salient
feature
of
the
technology_15
technology_2
be
provide
quality_attribute_2
tojson
and
fromjson
to
convert
technology_3
connector_data_6
to
technology_1
and
vice
versa
support
arbitrarily
complex
connector_data_6
it
have
extensive
support
of
technology_3
generic
allow
custom
representation
for
connector_data_6
allow
pre
exist
unmodifiable
connector_data_6
to
be
convert
to
and
from
technology_1
both
technology_15
and
technology_14
be
powerful
and
extremely
popular
and
now
it
s
up
to
you
to
decide
which
one
to
use
in
your
project
this
be
part
of
the
design
component_5
where
you
need
to
choose
a
technology_21
and
technology_2
for
your
component_9
if
you
be
to
this
component_5
i
recommend
join
the
architecture
in
technology_3
design
&
development
on
educative
a
text
base
interactive
component_6
technology_13
quality_attribute_2
the
technology_13
quality_attribute_2
be
one
of
the
quality_attribute_2
technology_1
technology_2
also
lightweight
you
can
use
this
technology_2
to
encode
or
decode
technology_1
text
it
s
an
open
component_10
lightweight
technology_2
that
be
quality_attribute_5
and
easy
to
be
use
by
quality_attribute_6
connector_data_7
and
connector_data_5
from
jdk
a
quality_attribute_4
thing
about
this
technology_2
that
it
have
no
external
connector_7
and
both
component_10
and
binary
be
jdk
quality_attribute_7
pro
of
technology_13
quality_attribute_2
be
that
it
be
lightweight
and
it
provide
support
for
technology_3
io
reader
and
writer
you
can
take
your
decision
quality_attribute_4
if
you
about
technology_1
technology_11
how
connector_data_8
be
represent
there
i
would
suggest
connector_11
begin
technology_1
by
ben
smite
to
more
about
technology_1
technology_11
if
you
be
look
for
a
quality_attribute_2
lightweight
technology_3
technology_2
that
connector_9
and
connector_10
technology_1
and
support
connector_13
technology_13
quality_attribute_2
be
probably
a
quality_attribute_4
match
it
do
what
it
say
with
and
work
on
component_11
jres
a
well
in
order
to
use
technology_13
quality_attribute_2
technology_22
you
need
to
include
technology_20
connector_7
in
your
project
s
pom
technology_17
or
alternatively
you
can
also
include
the
follow
jar
in
your
classpath
you
can
also
see
this
to
about
how
to
connector_5
technology_1
in
technology_3
use
technology_13
quality_attribute_2
flexjson
flexjson
be
another
lightweight
technology_2
for
serialize
and
deserializing
technology_3
connector_data_6
into
and
from
technology_1
technology_11
allow
both
deep
and
shallow
copy
of
connector_data_4
the
depth
to
which
an
connector_data_4
be
serialize
can
be
control
with
flexjson
and
thus
make
it
similar
to
lazy
loading
allow
u
to
extract
only
the
connector_data_8
we
need
this
be
not
the
requirement_4
since
we
want
an
entire
connector_data_4
to
be
connector_14
to
but
it’s
quality_attribute_4
to
that
it
can
do
that
if
you
that
you
be
go
to
use
only
a
small
amount
of
connector_data_1
in
your
component_9
and
you
wish
to
component_12
or
connector_5
it
to
and
from
technology_1
technology_11
you
should
consider
use
flexjson
or
technology_15
you
can
also

you
can
choose
between

the
best
if

look

and
if
