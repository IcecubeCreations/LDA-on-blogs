“you

”the

fit

in

component_15
from
which
a

of
concurrent
component_16
will
pick
them
up
and
handle
them
here
be
some
especially
important
requirement
for
chatbots
instant
handle
–
the
component_17
sit
behind
the
webhook
should
handle
incoming
connector_data_6
instantly
by
move
them
straight
to
the
connector_data_7
component_15
some
chat
component_10
be
pretty
touchy
about
delay
so
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_5
than
sorry
assign
component_18
–
the
connector_data_7
component_15
should
guarantee
that
each
component_12
will
always
be
handle
by
the
same
component_18
component_19
in
connector_data_7
component_15
lingo
this
be
necessary
to
ensure
that
connector_data_6
connector_18
by
a
component_12
be
always
handle
in
the
order
in
which
they
be
connector_19
load
balance
–
the
connector_data_7
component_15
should
also
perform
pattern_4
to
keep
the
component_16
reasonably
occupy
with
connector_data_8
propagation
–
if
a
component_18
die
the
component_15
should
be
able
to
transfer
it
responsibility
to
another
component_18

component_5
loop
–
a
worker’s
component_5
loop
include
these
step
pop
a
connector_data_7
from
the
component_15
fetch
the
conversation
state
associate
with
the

handle
the
connector_data_7
possibly
connector_data_9
to
the
component_12
and
connector_20
the
update
state
back
storage
–
the
storage
place
for
the
per
component_12
conversation
state
should
allow
quality_attribute_6
connector_data_10
and
fast
connector_6
connector_21
connector_5
the
best
choice
seem
to
be
a
technology_6
component_20
we
opt
for
technology_7
because
it
quality_attribute_7
and
quality_attribute_8

seem
perfect
for
keep
track
of
the

we
do
some
research
on

our
first
find
be

and

be
satisfy

come
a
a

be
that

the

perhaps
worth
