i
find
a
quality_attribute_2
quality_attribute_3
and
short
description
of
three
well

open_source
connector_data_1
component_2
technology_2
technology_1
and
technology_5
the
description
be
especially
useful
because
they
draw
useful
comparison
between
the
three
pattern_1
they
be
connector_3
in

but
edit
late
last
year
credit
go
to
julien
and
endy
tjahjono
for
these
description
on
so
technology_1
be
one
of
the
lead
implementation
of
the
technology_6
technology_7
along
with
technology_8
technology_9
therefore
it
connector_4
a
pattern_1
architecture
mean
that
connector_data_2
be
component_3
on
a
central
technology_10
before
be
connector_5
to
component_4
this
approach
make
technology_1
very
easy
to
use
and
quality_attribute_4
because
advance
scenario
connector_6
load
balance
or
persistent
connector_data_1
pattern_4
be
support
in
a
few
line
of

however
it
also
make
it
le
quality_attribute_5
and
“slower”
because
the
central
technology_10

quality_attribute_6
and
connector_data_1
envelope
be
quite
big
technology_5
be
a
very
lightweight
pattern_5
component_5
specially
design
for
high
quality_attribute_7
low
quality_attribute_6
scenario
the
one
you
can
find
in
the
financial
world
zmq
support
many
advance
pattern_5
scenario
but
contrary
to
technology_1
you’ll
have
to
connector_7
most
of
them
yourself
by
combine
various
piece
of
the
technology_11
e
g
technology_12
and
component_6
zmq
be
very
quality_attribute_8
but
you’ll
have
to
study
the

component_7
or
so
of
the
guide
which
i
recommend
connector_8
for
anybody
connector_9
quality_attribute_9
component_5
even
if
you
don’t
use
zmq
before
be
able
to
do
anything
more
complicate
that
connector_10
connector_data_2
between

peer
technology_2
be
in
the
middle
grind
zmq
it
can
be
quality_attribute_4
with
both
pattern_1
and
pattern_6
topology
technology_1
it’s
easy
to
connector_7
advance
scenario
but
usually
at
the
cost
of
raw
requirement_6
it’s
the
swiss
army
knife
of
pattern_5
