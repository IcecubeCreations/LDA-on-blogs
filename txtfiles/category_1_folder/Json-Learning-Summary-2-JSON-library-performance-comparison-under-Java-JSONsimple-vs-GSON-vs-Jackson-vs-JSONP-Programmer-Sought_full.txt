technology_2
technology_3
requirement_1
comparison
under
technology_4
technology_1
quality_attribute_1
vs
technology_5
vs

vs
jsonp
technology_2
have
become
the
connector_1
technology_7
for
connector_data_1
transfer
between
component_1
and
web
component_2
but
a
with
what
we
be
use
to
you
will
feel
that
this
be
a
matter
of
and
no
long
think
deeply
we
rarely
think
about
the
difference
between
these
technology_2
technology_3
but
in
fact
they
be
not
the
same
therefore
we
run
a
benchmark
to
test
several
commonly
use
technology_2
technology_3
to
see
which
technology_3
be
the
fast
when
requirement_3
of
different
size
i
will
connector_2
the
connector_data_2
with
you
below
technology_2
be
commonly
use
to
transfer
and
requirement_3
large

this
be
a
very
common
scenario
for
connector_data_1
pattern_1
run
on
technology_8
or
technology_9
cluster
at
a
give
size
you
can
see
a
significant
difference
in
the
quality_attribute_2
of
requirement_3
between
different
technology_3
in
the
requirement_4
of
high
quality_attribute_3
small
be
frequently
connector_3
and
requirement_3
so
the
requirement_1
gap
not
be
obvious
at
first
but
if
you
need
to
requirement_3
a
large
number
of
small
frequently
under
very
high
load
the
gap
start
to
increase
pattern_2
and
quality_attribute_4
architecture
often
use
technology_2
to
transfer
such

a
this
be
already
the
de
facto
technology_7
for
the
web
technology_10
not
all
technology_2
technology_3
be
connector_4
telunsu
how
to
choose
the
right
technology_3
accord
to
the
usage
scenario
be
very
important
i
hope
this
benchmark
will
help
you
technology_1

we
selected
four
mainstream

quality_attribute_1
technology_5
technology_6
and
jsonp
these

be
usually
use

the
reason

choose
them

this
connector_data_4
seem
to
be
very
convincing
however
from
the
average
connector_data_2
of
all
the
document
the
technology_5
champion
be
well
deserved
and
the
two
or
three
battle
between
technology_1
quality_attribute_1
and
jsonp
should
be
no
suspense
technology_6
be
the
bottom
of

round
although
technology_1
quality_attribute_1
didn
t
win
first
on
any

overall
it
resolution
rate
be
second
although
jsonp
win
the
championship
on
many
document
on
average
it
only
connector_6
the
third
place
it
s
also
worth
note
that
although
technology_6
be
the
slow
technology_3
in
this
round
it
perform
very
well
in
all

the
other
three
technology_3
be
occasionally
much
fast
than
technology_6
but
they
be
requirement_3
on
other

the
quality_attribute_2
be
quite
or
even
bad
coding_keyword_2
s
turn
these
number
into
percentage
and
see
the
same
two
dimension
compare
with
the
big
test
the
gap
be
relatively
small
but
it
can
t
be
ignore
conclusion
unfortunately
technology_1
quality_attribute_1
have
lose
the
championship
with
a
weak
disadvantage
this
round
of
technology_5
win
jsonp
be
still
the
third
year
of
the
millennium
and
this
time
technology_6
have
catch
a
late
episode
to
sum
up
requirement_3
quality_attribute_2
be
not
the
only
indicator
of
a
technology_2
technology_3
but
it
be
really
important
by
run
this
benchmark
we
find
that
no
technology_3
can
beat
opponent
on
all

the
outstanding
requirement_1
in
large
have
be
root
in
small

and
vice
versa
if
you
want
to
choose
which
technology_3
to
choose
from
the
quality_attribute_2
of
analysis
it
quality_attribute_6
on
your
use
of
the
scene
if
your
component_2
often
handle
large
technology_2

then
technology_6
should
be
your
dish
technology_5
be
quite
struggle
on
large

if
you
be
primarily
deal
with
small
connector_data_5
such
a
the
initialization
of
a
pattern_3
or
quality_attribute_4
architecture
then
technology_5
be
prefer
technology_6
s
requirement_1
on
small
be
not
satisfactory
if
you
re
go
to
deal
with
both
of
these

then
technology_1
quality_attribute_1
which
be
second
in
both
round
of
requirement_1
be
more
suitable
for
such
scenario
technology_6
and
technology_5

t
perform
well
on
different
size
unless
you

t
consider
the
resolution
quality_attribute_2
jsonp
have
nothing
to
praise
it
requirement_1
on
large
and
small
be
very
bad
compare
to
other
technology_3
fortunately
technology_4

will
soon
have
a
requirement_6
technology_2
implementation
and
i
believe
jsonp
s
future
requirement_1
be
still
worth
look
connector_7
to
i
finally
finish
it
if
you
be
sensitive
to
the
requirement_3
quality_attribute_2
of
the
technology_2
technology_3
choose
technology_6
for
large

technology_5
for
small

and
technology_1
quality_attribute_1
for
both
