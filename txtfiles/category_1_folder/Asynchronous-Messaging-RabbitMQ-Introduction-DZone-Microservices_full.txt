technology_1
be
consider
a
quality_attribute_2
open
component_2
connector_data_1
pattern_4
implementation
it
be
consider
by
many
a
the
natural
evolution
of
technology_3
what
be
bring
to
the
component_3
be
the
quality_attribute_3
of
disparate
and
heterogeneous
party
indeed
a
component_4
in
net
for
example
can
seamlessly
exchange
connector_data_2
with
a
component_5
on
technology_2
with
minimal
connector_4
to
any
of
these
it
be
worth
note
that
technology_1
be
build
with
technology_4
the
leader
technology_5
in
telecommunication
component_6
within
builtin
support
for
fault
tolerance
technology_1
promote
the
usage
of
technology_6
advance
pattern_5
pattern_6
technology_7
a
the
wire
level
technology_7
or
requirement_7
technology_7
for
exchange
connector_data_1
it
be
a
binary
technology_7
that
deal
with
the
low
level
detail
of
encoding
and
marshal
of
connector_data_1
content
architecturally
technology_1
provide
the
follow
advantage
quality_attribute_4
aside
from
be
build
with
technology_4
technology_1
can
be
configure
to
persist
connector_data_1
so
that
in
requirement_8
of
a
component_7
crash
all
connector_data_2
can
be
restore
additionally
component_8
and
component_9
can
acknowledge
proper
reception
delivery
of
connector_data_1
customize
connector_5
technology_1
support
different
mechanism
for
connector_6
through
the
use
of
exchange
it
can
for
example
provide
point
to
point
connector_1
through
direct
connector_5
selective
connector_data_1
delivery
similar
to
technology_8
connector_data_1
selector
so
that
only
carry
a
certain
connector_5
key
connector_3
connector_7
to
a
component_10
build
in
support
for
cluster
and
high
quality_attribute_5
many
instance
of
technology_1
can
be
logically
group
under
a
single
cluster
in
order
to
provide
pattern_7
and
ultimately
high
quality_attribute_5
in
the
requirement_8
of
crash
script
and
administration
technology_1
provide
both
a
web
base
console
for
the
purpose
of
pattern_8
and
administration
in
addition
it
provide
a
command
line
to
automate
it
administration
through
script
versatility
there
be
a
plethora
of
component_11
for
different
component_12
technology_9
terminology
since
a
picture
be
worth
a
thousand
word

s
start
with
a
high
level
schematic
from
the
technology_1
documentation
pattern_9
the
party
that
be
at
the
origin
of
the
connector_data_1
to
be
connector_8
component_5
the
destination
party
that
express
it
interest
in
one
or
more
connector_data_1
connector_data_1
pattern_4
the
pattern_5
solution
in
this
requirement_8
technology_1
it
be
make
of
exchange
the
abstraction
that
describe
an
intermediate

stage
on
the
connector_data_1
pattern_4
where
all
connector_data_2
be
connector_7
first
component_10
the
intermediate
where
connector_data_2
be
connector_9
from
the
exchange
connector_10
provide
a
connector_6
strategy
to
define
how
and
when
connector_data_2
on
the
exchange
should
be
relay
to
the
component_10
this
usually
take
the
form
of
a
connector_6
key
and
follow
a
bind
definition
in
the
next
installment
we
ll
have
a
look
at
the
different
type
of
exchange
and
