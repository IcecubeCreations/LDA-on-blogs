the

idea
behind

design
be
to

flumethere
be
several
advantage
of

technology_2
which
make
it
a

the
advantage
be
technology_2
be
quality_attribute_9
quality_attribute_5
fault

and
quality_attribute_10
for

component_14
and
connector_12

technology_32
&
technology_23
technology_2
be
horizontally
quality_attribute_9
if
the
connector_8
rate
exceed
the
connector_2
rate
technology_2
provide
a
steady
flow
of
connector_data_1
between
connector_8
and
connector_2

technology_2
provide
quality_attribute_5
connector_data_4
delivery
the
transaction
in

be
pattern_6
base
where
two
transaction
one
sender
&
one
receiver
be
maintain
for
each
connector_data_4
use
technology_35
we
can
ingest
connector_data_1
from
multiple
component_16
into
technology_5
it
give
u
a
solution
which
be
quality_attribute_5
and
quality_attribute_2
and
help
u
in
connector_11
aggregate
and
move
large
amount
of
connector_data_1
set

twitter
and
e
commerce

it
help
u
to
ingest
online
connector_1
connector_data_1
from
various
component_14
requirement_6
traffic
social

connector_data_4
requirement_14
etc
in
technology_23
it
support
a
large
set
of
component_14
and
destination
type
the
architecture
be
one
which
be
empower
technology_1
technology_2
with
these
benefit
now
a
we
the
advantage
of
technology_1
technology_35
coding_keyword_2
move
ahead
and
understand
technology_1
technology_2
architecture
technology_1
technology_2

technology_2
architecturenow
coding_keyword_2
u
understand
the
architecture
of
technology_2
from
the
below
diagram
there
be
a
technology_2
agent
which
ingest
the
connector_1
connector_data_1
from
various
connector_data_1
component_14
to
technology_23
from
the
diagram
you
can
easily
understand
that
the
web
component_17
indicate
the
connector_data_1
component_13
twitter
be
among
one
of
the
famous
component_14
for
connector_1
connector_data_1
the
technology_35
agent
have

component_18
component_13
connector_12
and
pattern_6
component_13
it
connector_14
the
connector_data_1
from
the
incoming
streamline
and
connector_13
the
connector_data_1
in
the
pattern_6
pattern_6
in
general
the
connector_15
quality_attribute_11
be
fast
than
the
connector_5
quality_attribute_11
thus
we
need
some
buffer
to
match
the
connector_8
&
connector_2
quality_attribute_11
difference
basically
the
buffer
act
a
a
pattern_7
storage
that
connector_13
the
connector_data_1
be
transfer
temporarily
and
therefore
prevent
connector_data_1
loss
similarly
pattern_6
act
a
the
local
storage
or
a
temporary
storage
between
the
component_13
of
connector_data_1
and
persistent
connector_data_1
in
the
technology_23
connector_12
then
our
last
component_18
i
e
connector_12
connector_16
the
connector_data_1
from
the
pattern_6
and
connector_17
or
connector_18
the
connector_data_1
in
the
technology_23
permanently
now
a
we
how
technology_1
technology_2
work
coding_keyword_2
u
take
a
look
at
a
practical
where
we
will
connector_12
the
twitter
connector_data_1
and
component_15
it
in
the
technology_23
technology_1
technology_2

connector_1
twitter
datain
this
practical
we
will
connector_4
connector_data_1
from
twitterusing
technology_2
and
then
component_15
the
connector_data_1
in
technology_23
a
show
in
the
below
image
the
first
step
be
to
create
a
twitter
component_19
for
this
you
first
have
to
go
to
this
url
technology_36
component_20
twitter
technology_37
and
sign
in
to
your
twitter
account
go
to
create
component_19
tab
a
show
in
the
below
image
then
create
an
component_19
a
show
in
the
below
image
after
create
this
component_19
you
will
find
key
&
connector_19
connector_data_5
copy
the
key
and
the
connector_19
connector_data_5
we
will
pass
these
connector_data_5
in
our
technology_2
configuration
to
connector_20
to
this
component_19
now
create
a
technology_35
conf
in
the
flume’s
root
directory
a
show
in
the
below
image
a
we
discuss
in
the
flume’s
architecture
we
will
configure
our
component_13
connector_12
and
pattern_6
our
component_13
be
twitter
from
where
we
be
connector_1
the
connector_data_1
and
our
connector_12
be
technology_23
where
we
be
connector_5
the
connector_data_1
in
component_13
configuration
we
be
pass
the
twitter
component_13
type
a

technology_1
technology_35
component_13
twitter
twittersource
then
we
be
pass
all
the
four
connector_data_5
which
we
connector_21
from
twitter
at
last
in
component_13
configuration
we
be
pass
the
keywords
on
which
we
be
go
to
fetch
the
tweet
in
the
connector_12
configuration
we
be
go
to
configure
technology_23
property
we
will
set
technology_23
path
connector_2
technology_38
type
pattern_8
size
etc
at
last
we
be
go
to
set
memory
pattern_6
a
show
in
the
below
image
now
we
be
all
set
for
connector_22
coding_keyword_2
u
go
ahead
and
connector_23
this
command
$flume_home
bin
technology_35
ng
agent
conf
conf
f
$flume_home
technology_35
confafter
connector_23
this
command
for
a
while
and
then
you
can
exit
the
terminal
use
ctrl+c
then
you
can
go
ahead
in
your
technology_5
directory
and
connector_24
the
mention
path
whether
the
be
create
or
not
download
the
and
open
it
you
will
connector_25
something
a
show

i
hope
this
