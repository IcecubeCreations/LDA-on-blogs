you
be
build

component_3
that
take
order
from
requirement_5
verify
inventory
and
quality_attribute_9
credit
and
ship
them
the

consist

component_11
include
the

which
connector_10
the

along
with
some

for

credit
maintain

show
me
the
please
see
the
example

develop
by
chris
richardson
these
example
on
technology_11
illustrate
various
aspect
of
the
pattern_1
architecture
connector_data_6
component_1
benefit
this
solution
have
a
number
of
benefit
enable
the
continuous
delivery
and
deployment
of
large
complex
component_3
improve
quality_attribute_10
each
component_13
be
relatively
small
and
so
be
easy
to
understand
and
connector_12
quality_attribute_11
quality_attribute_12
component_7
be
small
and
fast
to
test
quality_attribute_11
quality_attribute_13
component_7
can
be
quality_attribute_8
independently
it
enable
you
to
organize
the
development
effort
around
multiple
autonomous
team
each
so
connector_13
two
pizza
team
own
and
be
responsible
for
one
or
more
component_13
each
team
can
develop
test
quality_attribute_8
and
quality_attribute_4
their
component_7
independently
of
all
of
the
other
team
each
pattern_1
be
relatively
small
easy
for
a
developer
to
understand
the
ide
be
fast
make
developer
more
productive
the
component_3
start
fast
which
make
developer
more
productive
and
quality_attribute_14
up
deployment
improve
fault
isolation
for
example
if
there
be
a
memory
leak
in
one
component_13
then
only
that
component_13
will
be
affect
the
other
component_7
will
continue
to
handle
connector_data_7
in
comparison
one
misbehave
component_15
of
a
monolithic
architecture
can
bring
down
the
entire
component_10
eliminate
any
long
term
commitment
to
a
technology_6
technology_12
when
develop
a
component_13
you
can
pick
a
technology_6
technology_12
similarly
when
make
major
connector_6
to
an
exist
component_13
you
can
rewrite
it
use
a
technology_6
technology_12
drawback
this
solution
have
a
number
of
drawback
developer
must
deal
with
the
additional
complexity
of
create
a
quality_attribute_15
component_10
developer
must
connector_14
the
inter
component_13
connector_7
mechanism
and
deal
with
partial
failure
connector_15
connector_data_2
that
span
multiple
component_7
be
more
difficult
test
the
connector_16
between
component_7
be
more
difficult
connector_15
connector_data_2
that
span
multiple
component_7
require
careful
coordination
between
the
team
developer
technology_13
ides
be
orient
on
build
monolithic
component_6
and
don’t
provide
explicit
support
for
develop
quality_attribute_15
component_3
deployment
complexity
in
production
there
be
also
the
operational
complexity
of
quality_attribute_8
and
manage
a
component_10
comprise
of
many
different
component_13
increase
memory
consumption
the
pattern_1
architecture
replace
n
monolithic
component_3
instance
with
nxm
component_7
instance
if
each
component_13
run
in
it
own
technology_14
or
equivalent
which
be
usually
necessary
to
isolate
the
instance
then
there
be
the
overhead
of
m
time
a
many
technology_14
runtimes
moreover
if
each
component_13
run
on
it
own
vm
e
g
technology_15
instance
a
be
the
requirement_6
at
netflix
the
overhead
be
even
high
issue
there
be
many
issue
that
you
must
connector_17
when
to
use
the
pattern_1
architecture
one
challenge
with
use
this
approach
be
decide
when
it
make
sense
to
use
it
when
develop
the
first
version
of
an
component_3
you
often
do
not
have
the
problem
that
this
approach
solve
moreover
use
an
elaborate
quality_attribute_15
architecture
will
slow
down
development
this
can
be
a
major
problem
for
startup
whose
big
challenge
be
often
how
to
rapidly
quality_attribute_16
the
requirement_4
component_16
and
accompany
component_3
use
y
technology_8
split
might
make
it
much
more
difficult
to
iterate
rapidly
late
on
however
when
the
challenge
be
how
to
quality_attribute_4
and
you
need
to
use
functional
decomposition
the
tangle
connector_18
might
make
it
difficult
to
decompose
your
monolithic
component_3
into
a
set
of
component_13
how
to
decompose
the
component_3
into
component_13
another
challenge
be
decide
how
to
component_17
the
component_10
into
pattern_6
this
be
very
much
an
art
but
there
be
a
number
of
strategy
that
can
help
decompose
by
requirement_4
capability
and
define
component_7
correspond
to
requirement_4
capability
decompose
by
domain
drive
design
subdomain
decompose
by
verb
or
use
requirement_6
and
define
component_7
that
be
responsible
for
particular
action
e
g
a
ship
component_13
that’s
responsible
for
ship
complete
order
decompose
by
by
noun
or
resource
by
define
a
component_13
that
be
responsible
for
all
on
component_18
resource
of
a
give
type
e
g
an
account
component_13
that
be
responsible
for
manage
component_14
account
ideally
each
component_13
should
have
only
a
small
set
of
responsibility
uncle
bob
martin
talk
about
design
use
the
single
responsibility
principle
srp
the
srp
define
a
responsibility
of
a
a
a
reason
to
connector_12
and
state
that
a
should
only
have
one
reason
to
connector_12
it
make
sense
to
apply
the
srp
to
component_13
design
a
well
another
analogy
that
help
with
component_13
design
be
the
design
of
unix
utility
unix
provide
a
large
number
of
utility
such
a
grep
cat
and
find
each
utility
do
exactly
one
thing
often
exceptionally
well
and
be
intend
to
be
combine
with
other
utility
use
a
shell
script
to
perform
complex
connector_data_8
how
to
maintain
connector_data_5
consistency
in
order
to
ensure
loose
couple
each
component_13
have
it
own
component_9
maintain
connector_data_5
consistency
between
component_7
be
a
challenge
because

phase
connector_19
quality_attribute_15
transaction
be
not
an
option
for
many
component_3
an
component_3
must
instead
use
the
saga
pattern_2
a
component_13
publish
an
when
it
connector_data_5
connector_12
other
component_7
connector_2
that
and
update
their
connector_data_5
there
be
several
way
of
quality_attribute_17
update
connector_data_5
and
publish
include
component_19
and
transaction
requirement_7
tail
how
to
connector_14
query
another
challenge
be
connector_15
connector_20
that
need

owned
by
multiple
component_13
the
component_5
composition
