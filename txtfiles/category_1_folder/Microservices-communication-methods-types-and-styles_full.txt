pattern_1

type
and
style
pattern_1
connector_1

type
and
style
pattern_1
be
an
it
and
programming
architecture
style
that
be
mainly
characterize
by
the
breakdown
of
it
component_9
into
small
element
that
be
independent
one
to
another
this
approach

quality_attribute_3
and
dynamism
since
it
be
easy
to
feature
to
a
component_10
component_11
when
divide
it
into
multiple
part
than
it
be
when
organize
a
a
single
component_12
monolithic
architecture
but
on
the
other
hand
it
also
imply
challenge
and
problem
that
need
to
be
solve
such
a
the
connector_1
between
pattern_1
what
be
the
connector_1
between
pattern_1
one
of
the
most
important
aspect
of
develop
an
component_12
or
base
on
pattern_1
be
the
connector_1
between
them
a
component_5
that
can
turn
out
to
be
quite
complex
in
a
monolithic
architecture
component_11
which
run
a
a
single
component_5
a
a
connector_data_2
the
various
component_13
connector_4
with
each
other
via
technology_8
level
connector_data_3
these
component_13
be
closely
connector_5
to
each
other
in
requirement_7
specific
connector_data_4
be
create
via

or
loosely
couple
connector_6
can
be
establish
if
reference
to
abstraction
be
use
use
connector_7
insertion
a
pattern_1
base
component_12
or
a
a
component_14
that
be
also
run
on
different
component_5
component_8
and
oftentimes
also
on
several
component_15
or
component_16
since
it
be
common
for
each
component_8
instance
to
work
a
a
separate
component_5
component_3
need
to
work
through
the
use
of
a
component_5
connector_1
technology_9
quality_attribute_4
on
the
nature
of
each
component_8
these
technology_9
be
technology_10
technology_11
or
a
binary
technology_12
technology_9
all
of
this
imply
that
in
the
pattern_1
architecture
it
be
necessary
to
connector_8
the
connector_1
mechanism
there
be
several
possible
solution
and
it
be
important
to
choose
the
most
suitable
for
each
develop
through
pattern_1
since
some
connector_1
component_2
be
inefficient
and
lead
to
poor
requirement_10
of
the
or
component_12
the
truth
be
that
there
be
not
a
one
but
several
pattern_5
connector_1
solution
below
we
will
connector_data_5
the
different
option
type
of
pattern_5
connector_9
the
connector_1
between
the
component_17
and
the
different
pattern_1
can
be
accomplish
through
different
type
of
connector_1
each
focus
on
a
different
scenario
in
general
there
be
two
criterion
to
classify
these
connector_1
component_14
base
on
the
type
of
technology_9
pattern_6
or
pattern_7
base
on
the
number
of
receiver
one
or
many
pattern_6
or
pattern_7
technology_9
these
be
the
difference
between
them
pattern_6
technology_9
it
be
characterize
for
be
a
component_14
that
imply
isolate
each
pattern_5
a
much
a
possible
since
sub
component_5
connector_10
lock
technology_10
technology_10
would
be
a
typical
example
of
pattern_7
pattern_5
connector_1
technology_9
where
the
component_17
can
only
continue
it
when
it
connector_11
a
connector_12
from
the
component_18
pattern_7
technology_9
in
this
requirement_7
the
sub
component_5
be
not
lock
and
technology_9
that
be
quality_attribute_5
with
many
operate
component_2
and
requirement_4
environment
be
use
one
example
would
be
the
technology_11
technology_9
where
the
client’s
or
connector_data_6
sender’s
usually
do
not
wait
for
a
connector_data_7
what
be
do
be
simply
connector_13
a
connector_data_6
to
a
technology_13
component_19
or
any
other
pattern_8
agent
one
or
many
receiver
the
second
classification
criterion
of
pattern_5
connector_1
technology_9
be
the
number
of
receiver
distinguish
between
one
or
many
receiver
single
receiver
in
this
requirement_7
each
connector_data_8
must
be
component_5
by
a
receiver
or
component_8
one
example
of
this
type
of
connector_1
be
the
command
pattern_4
many
receiver
one
example
of
this
type
be
the
pattern_9
pattern_1
architecture
which
be
base
on
a
pattern_8
agent
or
bus
that
pattern_10
the
connector_data_1
connector_data_9
among
different
pattern_1
via

generally
this
be
connector_14
through
a
component_8
bus
or
similar
component_20
such
a
technology_14
component_8
bus
use
theme
and
subscription
connector_1
style
between
pattern_1
one
the
type
of
connector_1
between
pattern_1
to
be
use
be
chosen
there
be
a
wide
range
of
technology_9
and
different
option
this
be
what
be

a
pattern_5
connector_1
style
for
example
if
you
be
go
to
use
pattern_7
connector_1
–
therefore
base
on
the
connector_data_8
connector_12
–
you
have
the
possibility
of
use
different
approach
of
connector_1
style
in
this
requirement_7
the
technology_10
technology_9
and
the
pattern_11
technology_9
be
the
most
widespread
but
there
be
other
option
such
a
the
technology_15
component_16
or
the
pattern_1
cluster
to
establish
connector_1
component_3
internally
or
the
binary
technology_16
connector_1
mechanism
such
a
wcg
over
technology_12
another
option
be
to
use
connector_data_6
base
pattern_7
connector_1
mechanism
such
a
technology_17
some
developer
choose
to
opt
for
a
non
technology_18
binary
technology_16
for
internal
connector_1
between
pattern_1
this
option
be
possible
both
for
the
technology_15
component_16
and
for
the
pattern_1
cluster
for
example
technology_15
orchestrator
and
also
for
component_17
owned
component_9
that
connector_4
with
the
pattern_1
normally
pattern_5
base
component_9
use
component_2
that
combine
different
connector_1
style
the
most
common
type
be
a
single
receiver
connector_1
via
an
pattern_7
technology_9
with
technology_10
technology_10
be
one
of
the
most
use
complementarily
pattern_1
commonly
use
pattern_8
technology_9
in
the
pattern_7
connector_1
