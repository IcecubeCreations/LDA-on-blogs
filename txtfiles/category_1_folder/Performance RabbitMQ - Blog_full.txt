by

be
the
start
of
a
short
series
where
we
look
at
size
your
technology_1
cluster
the
actual
size
wholly
quality_attribute_4
on
your
hardware
and
workload
so
rather
than
tell
you
how
many
cpu
and
how
much
ram
you
should
provision
we’ll
create
some
general
guideline
and
use
a
requirement_2
study
to
show
what
thing
you
should
consider
connector_1
more
how
to
run
benchmarksjune

for

this
we’ll
take
a
look
at
the
various
option
for
run
technology_1
benchmark
but
before
we
do
you’ll
need
a
way
to
see
the
connector_data_2
and
look
at

by

vanlightlyin
the
last
we
run
some
quality_attribute_5
benchmark
on
a
single
component_2
to
see
what
effect
pipelining
pattern_4
confirm
and
component_6
acknowledgement
have
on
flow
control
specifically
we
look
at
pattern_4
restrict
the
number
of
in
flight
connector_data_3
connector_data_1
connector_3
but
pending
a
confirm
component_6
prefetch
the
number
in
flight
connector_data_3
the
pattern_1
will
allow
on
the
pattern_5
component_6
ack
interval
multiple
flag
usage
unsurprisingly
we
saw
when
we
restrict
pattern_4
and
the
pattern_1
to
a
small
number
of
in
flight
connector_data_3
at
a
time
that
quality_attribute_1
be
low
when
we
increase
that
limit
quality_attribute_1
increase
but
only
to
a
point
after
which
we
saw
no
more
quality_attribute_1
gain
but
instead
quality_attribute_2
increase
we
also
saw
that
allow
component_3
to
use
the
multiple
flag
be
beneficial
to
quality_attribute_1
in
this
we’re
go
to
look
at
those
same
three
setting
but
with
many
component_7
many
component_1
and
different
amount
of
load
include
stress
test
we’ll
see
that
pattern_4
confirm
and
component_6
acknowledgement
play
a
role
in
flow
control
to
help
prevent
overload
of
a
pattern_1

by

vanlightlyin
the
last
we
cover
what
flow
control
be
both
a
a
general
concept
and
the
various
flow
control
mechanism
quality_attribute_6
in
technology_1
we
saw
that
pattern_4
confirm
and
component_6
acknowledgement
be
not
connector_data_4
quality_attribute_7
measure
but
also
play
a
role
in
flow
control
in
this
we’re
go
to
look
at
how
component_8
developer
can
use
pattern_4
confirm
and
component_6
acknowledgement
to
connector_4
a
balance
of
quality_attribute_7
and
high
requirement_1
in
the
component_9
of
a
single
component_2
flow
control
become
especially
important
when
a
pattern_1
be
be
overload
a
single
component_2
be
unlikely
to
overload
your
pattern_1
if
you
connector_5
large
connector_data_3
then
sure
you
can
saturate
your
requirement_4
or
if
you
only
have
a
single
cpu
core
then
one
component_2
could
max
it
out
but
most
of
u
be
on


or
30+
core
component_10
but
it’s
interest
to
break
down
the
effect
of
confirm
and
acks
on
a
single
component_2
from
there
we
can
take

part
of
our

we’re

a

that

in

it

for

a
a
way
of
deal
with
a
connector_5
rate
that
exceed
it
component_12
rate
but
receiver
buffer
cannot
grow
forever
so
either
the
connector_5
rate
should
only
transiently
exceed
receiver
component_12
capacity
bursty
traffic
or
the
sender
must
be
slow
down
back

flow
control
be
a
way
of
apply
this
back
pressure
on
the
sender
slow
them
down
so
that
the
receiver’s
buffer
do
not
overflow
and
quality_attribute_2
do
not
grow
too
large
in
a
chain
of
sender
receiver
this
back
pressure
can
propagate
up
the
chain
to
the
origin
of
the
traffic
in
more
complex
graph
of
connector_6
component_13
flow
control
can
balance
incoming

between
fast
and

component_1
be
still
relatively
to
technology_1
and
many
people
have
still
not
make
the
jump
from
classic
mirror
component_2
before
you
migrate
to
this
component_2
type
you
need
to
make
sure
that
your
hardware
can
support
your
workload
and
a
big
factor
in
that
be
what
storage
drive
you
use
in
this
we’re
go
to
take
a
close
look
at
quorum
component_1
and
their
requirement_1
characteristic
on
different
storage
configuration
hdd
or
ssd
one
drive
or
multiple
drive
the
tl
dr
be
that
we
highly
recommend
ssds
when
use
quorum
component_2
the
reason
for
this
be
that
quorum
component_1
be
sensitive
to
io
quality_attribute_2
and
ssds
connector_7
lower
quality_attribute_2
io
than
hdds
with
high
io
quality_attribute_2
you’ll
see
lower
quality_attribute_1
high
end
to
end
quality_attribute_2
and
some
other
undesirable
effect
further
down
in
this
we’ll
demonstrate
why
we

there
be
