question
around
optimize
technology_2
component_3
with
the
argument
that
technology_2
be
slow
technology_2
be
the
glue
connector_4
disparate
component_2
the
connector_5
component_4
be
all
in
memory
and
it
doesn’t
require
any
persistent
state
so
in
99%
of
the
requirement_7
requirement_1
issue
be
due
to
bottleneck
in
other
component_2
or
have
the
component_5
design
do
without
requirement_1
consideration
if
that
be
the
requirement_7
there
isn’t
much
you
can
achieve
by
tune
technology_2
further
and
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
draw
board
but
sometimes
it
might
be
worth
squeeze
few
more
millisecond
from
your
technology_2
connector_1
tune
every
component_5
be
very
specific
and
dependent

and
the

requirement_7
here
be
some
idea
for
tune
technology_2
base
component_2
which
apply
for
you
or
not
tuningendpoints
in
technology_2
be
the
requirement_2
point
with
other
component_6
and
the
way
they
be
configure
will
have
a
huge
impact
on
the
requirement_1
of
the
component_2
understand
how
different
work
and
tune
those
should
be
the
one
of
the
first
place
to
start
with
here
be
few
example
connector_data_1
if
your
technology_2
component_5
be
use
connector_data_1
the
overall
requirement_1
will
be
heavily
dependent
on
the
requirement_1
of
the
pattern_3
component_2
there
be
too
many
factor
to
consider
here
but
the
one
be
connector_data_1
pattern_4
the
requirement_8
and
disk
quality_attribute_2
combine
with
the
pattern_4
topology
will
shape
the
pattern_4
requirement_1
to
give
you
an
idea
with
technology_5
a
relational
component_1
base
persistent
component_7
will
perform
around
50%
of
a
base
component_7
and
use
a
requirement_8
of
pattern_4
to
quality_attribute_3
horizontally
will
cost
another
30%
of
requirement_1
it
be
amaze
how
one
configuration
connector_6
in
technology_6
can
have
a
huge
impact
on
the
pattern_3
component_2
and
then
the
technology_2
component_5
there

if
requirement_1
be
a
priority
there
be
also
some
hack
you
can
do
on
the
technology_6
component_8
side
such
a
increasing

there
be
some
nice
slide
again
from

here
and
an
old
but
still
very
relevant
video
from
rob
davy
about
tune
technology_5
all
of
these
resource
should
give
you
enough
idea
to
experiment
and
improve
the
requirement_1
from
a
pattern_3
point
of
pattern_1
component_1
connector_9
use
pattern_5
whenever
possible
you
can
use
an
aggregator
to
connector_10
a
number
of
entry
before
perform
a
pattern_5
to
connector_11
with
the
component_1
for
example
with
the
technology_9
component_9
work
with
template
if
you
have
to
use

after
this
be
publish
christian
create
slide
with
late
version
of
technology_2
and
technology_3
connector_12
out
those
too
from
those
measurement
we
can
see
that
technology_10
perform
quality_attribute_4
than
technology_11
and
sprinttemplates
in
general
use
web
component_12
whenever
you
have
to
use
a
web
the
web
container
itself
have
to
be
tune
separately
from
technology_2
point
of
pattern_1
you
can
further
optimise
a
little
bit
by
skip
the
unmarshalling
if
you
t
need
technology_3
connector_data_2
and
use
pattern_6
component_13
concurrentconsumers
there
be
a

of
component_14
seda
vm
technology_13

that
support

before
use

capability
to
give
you
an
idea
see
how
amzon
technology_16

can
be
improve
through
these
option
connector_data_3
type
choicethe
type
and
the
technology_17
of
the
connector_data_3
the
be
pass
through
technology_2
connector_1
will
also
have
requirement_1
implication
to
demonstrate
that
s
see
few
example
content
base
pattern_7
splitter
pattern_8
be
example
of
eips
that
perform
some
work
base
on
the
connector_data_1
content
and
the
type
of
the
connector_data_1
affect
the
component_13
quality_attribute_2
of
these
element
below
be
a
requirement_9
from
christian
mueller
s
presentation
visualise
how
content
base
pattern_7
be
perform
with
different
kind
of
connector_data_1
content
base
connector_5
base
on
different
connector_data_3
type
for
example
if
you
have
a
large
connector_data_4
document
in
the
exchange
and
base
on
it
you
perform
content
base
connector_1
pattern_8
etc
that
will
affect
the
quality_attribute_2
of
the
connector_13
instead
you
can
extract
some
key
connector_data_5
from
the
document
and
populate
the
exchange
for
fast
connector_14
and
connector_5
late
marshal
unmarshaling
similarly
to
the
templating
component_4
different
connector_data_3
technology_17
covenrtors
perform
differently
to
see
some
metric
connector_12
again
christian
s
presentation
but
also
keep
in
mind
that
requirement_1
of
the
support
connector_data_3
technology_17
vary
between
different
version
and
component_16
so
measure
it
for
your
use
requirement_7
connector_15
technology_2
connector_16
and
connector_15
pattern_9
be
one
of
the
underrate
feature
that
can
be
useful
for
deal
with
large
connector_data_1
claim

eip
if
the

if

it

if
you
also
provide
a

rather
than

a

pick
a
at
a
time
and
component_19
it
through
the
connector_13
until
it
reach
the
end
of
the
connector_13
and
then
the
component_18
component_15
pick
the
next
this
be
when
technology_2
component_20
construct
can
be
useful
a
visualise
below
component_18
component_15
can
pick
a
and
pass
it
to
a
component_15
from
the

construct
for

then
the

can
pick
another
without
wait
for
the

to
complete
component_13
fully

consumingseda
component_9
seda
be
another
way
to
achieve
parallelism
in
technology_2
the
seda
component_9
have
in
memory
connector_data_6
to
accumulate
incoming
connector_data_7
from
the

and
concurrentconsumers
to
component_13
those
incoming
connector_data_8
in
parallel
by
multiple
component_15
pattern_6
redelivery
retry
if
you
be
use
an
error
pattern_12
with
a
redelivery
requirement_10
a
part
of
the
connector_5
component_13
you
can
configure
it
to
be
pattern_6
and
do
the
redeliveries
in
a
separate
component_15
that
will
use
a
separate
component_15
pool
for
the
redelivery
not
block
the
connector_data_8
component_13
component_15
while
wait
if
you
need
long
delay
redeliveries
it
might
be
a
quality_attribute_4
approach
to
use
technology_6
pattern_4
redelivery
that
be
different
from
component_18
redelivery
btw
where
the
redeliveries
will
be
persist
on
the
connector_data_1
pattern_4
and
not
keep
in
technology_2
component_5
memory
another
benefit
of
this
mechanism
be
that
the
redeliveries
will
survive
component_5
restart
and
also
play
nicely
when
the
component_5
be
cluster
i
have
describe
different
retry
pattern_10
in
technology_2
design
pattern_10
book
other
optimisationsthere
be
few
other
trick
you
can
do
to
micro
tune
technology_2
further
requirement_3
configuration
hopefully
you
t
have
to
requirement_3
every
connector_data_1
and
it
content
on
the
production
environment
but
if
you
have
to
consider
use
some
pattern_6
logger
on
a
high
quality_attribute_5
component_2
and
option
would
be
to
requirement_3
statistic
and
aggregate
metric
through
technology_2
quality_attribute_5
logger
quality_attribute_5
logger
allow
requirement_3
aggregate
statistic
on
fix
interval
or
base
on
the
number
of
component_13
connector_data_7
rather
than
per
connector_data_1
base
another
option
would
be
to
use
the
not
so
popular
technology_2
sampler
eip
and
requirement_3
only
sample
connector_data_7
every
now
and
then
disable
technology_18
by
default
technology_2
technology_18
instrumentation
be
enable
which
create
a
lot
of
mbeans
this
allow
pattern_13
and
requirement_11
of
technology_2
runtime
but
also
have
some
requirement_1
hit
and
require
more
resource
i
still
remember
the
time
when
i
have
to
fully
turn
off
technology_18
in
technology_2
in
order
to
run
it
with
512mb
heap
on
a
free
technology_19
account
a
a
minimum
consider
whether
you
need
any
technology_18
enable
at
all
and
if
so
whether
to
use
routesonly
default
or
extend
technology_18
profile
connector_data_1
history
technology_2
connector_17
the
connector_data_1
history
eip
and
run
it
by
default
while
on
development
environmnet
it
might
be
useful
to
see
every
a
connector_data_1
have
be
too
but
on
the
produciton
environment
you
might
consider
to
disable
this
feature
original
connector_data_1
every
technology_2
connector_13
will
make
a
copy
of
the
original
incoming
connector_data_1
before
any
modification
to
it
this
pristine
copy
of
the
connector_data_1
be
keep
in
requirement_7
it
be
need
to
be
redelivered
during
error
handle
or
with
oncompletion
construct
if
you
be
not
use
these
feature
you
can
disable
create
and
connector_18
the
original
state
of
every
incoming
connector_data_1
other
customisations
almost
every
feature
in
camelcontext
can
be
customize
for
example
you
can
use
lazyloadtypeconverters
for
a
fast
component_5
startup
or
configure
the
shutdownstrategy
for
a
quicker
shutdown
when
there
be
inflight
connector_data_1
or
a
use
a
custom
uuidgenerator
that
perform
fast
etc
component_5
designall
of
the
previous
tune
be
micro
optimization
compare
to
the
component_5
design
and
architecture
if
your
component_5
be
not
design
for
horizontal
quality_attribute_6
and
requirement_1
sooner
or
late
the
small
tune
hack
will
hit
their
limit
the
chance
be
what
you
be
do
have
be
do
previously
and
instead
of
reinvent
the
wheel
or
come
up
with
some
clever
design
from
the
experience
of
others
and
use
well
pattern_10
principle
and
practise
use
principle
from
technology_20
pattern_2

i
only
want
to

generation
component_5
by
which
can

anyway
use
the

be
another
way

component_5
instead
of
look

do

until
you
