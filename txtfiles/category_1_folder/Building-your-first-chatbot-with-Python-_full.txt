if
you
be
about
to
order
some
food
on

restaurant
s
or
you
need
assistance
because
your
pattern_1
be
not
work
properly
you
will
probably
connector_2
in
touch
with
a
requirement_1
they
appear
to
you
instant
pattern_2
chat
in
one
of
the
corner
of
the
screen
and
gently
ask
you
whether
you
need
help
but
what
be
a
requirement_1
it
be
a
component_2
component_3
whose
aim
be
connector_3
with
human
a
they
connector_4
a
input
text
or
audio
the
most
sophisticate
chatbots
be
base
on
natural
technology_3
component_4
that
of
requirement_5
in
which
component_5
aim
at
interpret
the
way
human
connector_5
among
each
other
hence
their
natural
technology_3
which
might
be
connector_6
or
speak
if
you
want
to
connector_7
more
about
nlp
you
can
connector_7
my
former
here
however
many
chatbots
be
component_3
so
that
they
capture
some
keywords
which
be
directly
relate
to
pre
define
connector_8
this
component_4
be
base
on
a
first
train
of
the
algorithm
on
give
technology_4
where
it
will
be
able
to
size
the
connector_9
between
answer
and
question
a
well
a
some
emotional
reaction
typical
of
human
be
and
this
be
the
idea
behind
eliza
the
requirement_1
component_3
by
joseph
weizenbaum
it
recognize
clue
word
a
input
and
pre
component_3
sentence
a
output
this
might
sound
kind
of
naive
but
there
be
two
further
element
that
need
to
be
consider
first
when
i
say
some
clue
word
and
some
pre
component_3
connector_8
i
m
refer
to
the
enormous
amount
of
connector_data_1
on
which
the
requirement_1
have
be
train
namely
if
you
be
about
to
build
a
requirement_1
which
answer
question
about
the
empire
state
build
you
could
train
it
on
the
wikipedia
component_6
about
that
build
then
on
some
about
the
topic
and
even
on
book
which
take
place
in
nyc
and
involve
some
speech
about
it
so
even
though
connector_8
be
copy
and
not
originally
create
it
doesn
t
mean
your
requirement_1
be
not
able
to
reach
it
goal
the
second
element
be
a
bit
more
psychological
it
turn
out
that
chatbots
eliza
not
intelligent
by
definition
be
capable
of
be
interpret
a
intelligent
by
human
indeed
they
generate
an
illusion
of
understand
which
human
tend
to
appreciate
often
forget
they
be
not
talk
with
another
human
be
that
s
one
of
the
reason
why
these
naive
chatbots
be
so
popular
today
they
be
without
doubt
useful
for
several
purpose
range
from
online
assistance
to
personal
use
with
that
be
say
s
jump
to
the
practical
component_7
here
i
will
show
a
very
easy
implementation
of
a
naive
requirement_1
in
technology_1
use
a
pre
compile
technology_4
and
train
environment
connector_10
chatterbot
you
can
install
it
via
pip
install
chatterbot
in
your
terminal
#importing
the
technology_4
from
chatterbot
requirement_1
requirement_6
=
requirement_1
requirement_1
#importing
a
corpus
of
sample
sentence
and
conversation
so
that
our
requirement_1
#can
from

#
create
a
trainer
for
the

trainer
=
chatterbotcorpustrainer
requirement_6
#
train
the
requirement_1
base
on
the
english
corpus
other
technology_3
be
quality_attribute_2
too
trainer
train
chatterbot
corpus
english
a
you
can
see
the
corpus
technology_4
contain
many
domain
of
sample
conversation
or
sentence
sport
science
and
so
forth
to
give
you
the
intuition
i
will
replicate
the
match
manually
for
the
domain
greet
indeed
look
at
the
follow
greeting_inputs
=
hello
hi
quality_attribute_3
morning
what
s
up
hey
greeting_responses
=
hi
hey
quality_attribute_3
morning
hello
thanks
for
ask
my
help
greet
sentence
for
word
in
sentence
split
if
word
lower
in
greeting_inputs
random
choice
greeting_responses
random
choice
greeting_responses
you
can
see
that
i
connector_11
some
greet
connector_6
by
the
component_8
to
other
greet
which
will
be
the
requirement_1
s
connector_8
basically
i
define
a
greet
which
for
any
input
in
greeting_inputs
a
random
output
within
the
greeting_outputs
this
be
replicate
more
widely
for
each
category
of
the
chatterbot
corpus
now
s
initialize
out
requirement_1
while
true
#
input
connector_data_2
from
component_9
message=input
you
#if
connector_data_2
be

if

#if

to
thanks
or

you
if
connector_data_2
strip
==

or
connector_data_2
strip

thank
you
flag=false
requirement_1
you
be

#if

greet
if
greet
connector_data_2
strip

requirement_1
+greeting
connector_data_2
strip
else
#if
none
of
the
above

use
the

#
if
connector_data_2
be
bye
if
connector_data_2
strip
==

requirement_1
bye
break
it
wasn
t
too
bad
again
if
you
want
your
requirement_1
to
be
an
expert
in
a
specific
domain
you
should
train
it
on
that
topic
more
deeply
here
i
pick
some
random
domain
poorly
assort
compare
to
the
huge
range
of
potential
conversation
in
order
to
show
the
idea
behind
a
naive
requirement_1
of
intelligent
chatbots
those
which
use
nlp
technique
to
understand
human
connector_12
and
create
original
smart
connector_8
be
far
more
interest
and
this
of
study
be
quality_attribute_4
rapidly
nevertheless
naive
chatbots
be
still
widely
use
in
requirement_7
thanks
to
their
capability
of
be
see
a
intelligent

human
