and
be
develop

the
problem
of

by
create
a

for
how

should
be
pattern_3

between

etc
have
create

component_2
this
technology_13
binary

would
therefore
allow

‚Äì
connector_data_1
orient

q
how
do
technology_10
differ
from
technology_11
a
technology_1
be
a
technology_13
pattern_4
component_5
for
the
technology_6
component_4
it
provide
a
level
of
abstraction
that
free
developer
from
have
to
worry
about
specific
implementation
and
wire
technology_12
this
be
similar
to
the
technology_19
component_5
that
allow
you
to
easily
switch
component_6
with
technology_11
you
can
switch
from
one
technology_1
complian
connector_data_1
pattern_5
e
g
web
with
another
one
e
g
mqseries
or
webspehremq
with
little
or
no
connector_6
to
your
component_7
it
also
provide
quality_attribute_1
between
other
technology_20
base
technology_21
technology_22
and
technology_23
altough
technology_1
pattern_5
can
be
use
in
technology_24
component_8
the
whole
technology_1
specification
do
not
guarantee
quality_attribute_1
and
requirement_2
between
technology_6
to
technology_24
or
technology_6
to
technology_25
be
proprietary
and
can
be
quite
tricky
in
scenario
where
you
want
to
connector_7
a
connector_data_1
from
a
technology_6
base
connector_data_1
component_9
to
a
technology_24
base
connector_data_1
component_10
then
you
need
a
connector_data_1
base
cross
component_4
quality_attribute_1
that
be
what
technology_10
do
with
technology_2
you
can
use
any
technology_10
compliant
component_11
technology_26
and
technology_10
compliant
connector_data_1
pattern_5
q
what
be
the
different
alternative
to
quality_attribute_3
various
requirement_1
component_2
a
alternative
custom
solution
connector_8
an
individual
solution
that
work
for
your
problem
without
separate
problem
into
little
piece
for
example
use
technology_4
technology_27
for
web
component_12
overnight
pattern_6
run
to
load
connector_data_3
fee
technology_1
for
connector_data_1
etc
this
be
more
suit
for
small
use
requirement_5
this
have
high
quality_attribute_4
and
developer
effort
the
developer
have
to
handle
error
component_12
retry
pattern_7
requirement_6
etc
this
be
suit
if
you
want
to
quality_attribute_3
one
or
two
component_13
use
one
or
two
technology_12
alternative
use
an
opensource
requirement_2
technology_8
technology_3
requirement_2
or
technology_4
technology_5
this
help
you
quality_attribute_3
component_3
in
a
standardise
way
adhere
to
the
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_1
eip
technology_4
technology_5
be
a
light
weight
requirement_2
technology_8
that
allow
you
to
use
technology_15
technology_16
technology_11
technology_28
technology_29
technology_30
technology_11
technology_31
technology_32
and

to
name
a
few
you
use
the
same
concept
to
quality_attribute_3
various
technology_12
in
technology_4
technology_5
this
increase
quality_attribute_4
and
reduce
developer
effort
this
be
more
suit
if
you
want
to
quality_attribute_3
several
component_13
with
different
technology_12
alternative
use
an
esb
requirement_1
component_12

your
component_8
for

technology_34
component_12
bus
technology_35
esb

under

the
esb
also
u
an

requirement_6
requirement_7
pattern_8
high
quality_attribute_5
cluster
graphical

q
how
would
you
deal
with

a
you
can
reduce
the

with
the
use

temporarily
in

a

this
pattern_1
be
very

be
very
large
and
not
all
component_19
require
all
connector_data_5
a
content
pattern_11
can
be
use
to
remove
unwanted
connector_data_3
element
from
a
connector_data_1
it
be
useful
to
simplify
the
connector_data_8
of
the
connector_data_1
very
often
connector_data_2
be
represent

connector_data_9
contain

repeat
group
because
they
be
component_20
after
generic
normalize
component_6
connector_data_8
very
often
this
level
of
nest
be
superfluous
and
a
content
pattern_11
can
be
use
to
‚Äòflatten‚Äô
the
hierarchy
into
a
quality_attribute_7
connector_data_6
of
element
that
can
be
more
easily
understand
and
component_16
by
other
component_2
q
how
would
you
go
about
choose
between
technology_3
requirement_2
and
technology_4
technology_5
to
solve
common
requirement_2
problem
a
technology_3
requirement_2
provide

it
require

with

technology_3
technology_4
technology_5
be
almost

to

esb
and
offer
many
component_19
even
more
than
technology_3
requirement_2
for
almost
every
technology_39
you
could
think
of
if
there
be
no
component_21
quality_attribute_8
you
can
create
your
own
component_21
very
easily
start
with
a
technology_48
archetype
technology_5
also
support
a
technology_3
base
connector_data_10
configuration
a
well
a
a
‚Äúdsl‚Äù
for
technology_6
technology_23
and
technology_49
the
benefit
of
use
the
technology_6
dsl
be
that
your
ide
can
auto
complete
your

you
start
type
rather
than
have
to
mess
around
with
bucket
of
technology_50
the
technology_6
dsl
be
also
very
expressive
a
you
can
mix
and
match
your
own
within
the
technology_21
for
expression
or
predicate
evaluation
so
it
have
quality_attribute_9
readability
and
there
be
commercial
technology_51
‚Äúfuse

for
generate

technology_47
esb
be
another
choice
and
a
the

suggest
it
be
an

include
additional

this
can
be
compare
to
‚Äúapache
servicemix‚Äù
which
be
an
extension
to
technology_4
technology_5
technology_47
also
only
offer
connector_data_10

the
