environment
initially
technology_1
technology_2
be
develop
to
handle
only

use

to
quickly
component_7
large

of
connector_data_1
in
a
quality_attribute_7
manner
by
leverage
the
computing
power
of
multiple
component_9
within
a
requirement_7
yahoo
and
linkedin
be
few
of
the
requirement_8
that
rely
upon
technology_6
for
their
connector_data_1
requirement_9
why
technology_1
technology_4
organization
run
multiple
web
component_10
across
multiple
component_5
and
component_11
will
generate
multitude
of
requirement_2
on
a
daily
basis
these
requirement_2
will
contain
connector_data_2
about
and
activity
that
be
require
for
both
audit
and
analytical
purpose
they
can
size
up
to
terabyte
or
even
petabyte
and
significant
development
effort
and
infrastructure
cost
can
be
expend
in
an
effort
to
analyze
them
technology_2
be
a
popular
choice
when
it
come
to
build
connector_data_1
pipeline
for
requirement_2
connector_data_1
because
of
it
quality_attribute_8
quality_attribute_9
and
feature
—
which
be
describe
below
flume’s
feature
and
capability
technology_2
transfer
raw
requirement_2
by
connector_6
them
from
multiple
component_2
and
connector_3
them
to
the
technology_6
component_4
there
the
requirement_2
can
be
connector_7
by
analytical
technology_5
technology_11
or
technology_9
technology_2
can
connector_8
to
various
plugins
to
ensure
that
requirement_2
connector_data_1
be
connector_9
to
the
right
destination
transfer
requirement_2
to
multiple
component_2
connector_3
connector_data_1
with
technology_1
technology_4
architecture
and
example
the
component_7
of
connector_3
connector_data_1
through
technology_1
technology_2
need
to
be
plan
and
architected
to
ensure
connector_data_1
be
transfer
in
an
quality_attribute_2
manner
to
connector_4
connector_data_1
from
web
component_5
to
technology_7
the
technology_2
configuration
must
have
connector_data_2
about
where
the
connector_data_1
be
be
pick
up
from
and
where
it
be
be
connector_9
to
provide
this
connector_data_2
be
straightforward
flume’s
component_12
component_13
pick
up
the
requirement_2
from
the
component_12
or
connector_data_1
generator
and
connector_10
it
to
the
agent
where
the
connector_data_1
be
pattern_5
in
this
component_7
the
connector_data_1
to
be
connector_4
be
component_14
in
the
memory
which
be
mean
to
reach
the
destination
where
it
will
connector_11
with
it
architecture
there
be
three
important
part
of
technology_1
flume’s
connector_data_1
connector_3
architecture
the
connector_data_1
generate
component_12
the
technology_2
agent
and
the
destination
or
target
the
technology_2
agent
be
make
up
of
the
technology_2
component_12
the
pattern_5
and
the
connector_11
the
technology_2
component_12
pick
up
requirement_2
from
connector_data_1
generate
component_2
web
component_5
and
twitter
and
connector_10
it
to
the
pattern_5
the
flume’s
connector_11
component_13
ensure
that
the
connector_data_1
it
connector_12
be
pattern_6
to
the
destination
which
can
be
technology_7
a
component_1
technology_8
on
technology_7
or
an
requirement_10
technology_5
technology_11
below
be
the
basic
architecture
of
technology_2
for
an
technology_7
connector_11
technology_2
architecture
the
component_12
pattern_5
and
connector_11
component_15
be
part
of
the
technology_2
agent
when
connector_3
large
volume
of
connector_data_1
multiple
technology_2
agent
can
be
configure
to
connector_13
connector_data_1
from
multiple
component_12
and
the
connector_data_1
can
be
connector_4
in
parallel
to
multiple
destination
technology_2
architecture
can
vary
base
on
connector_data_1
connector_3
requirement
technology_2
can
be
configure
to
connector_4
connector_data_1
from
multiple
component_2
and
component_16
to
a
single
destination
or
from
a
single
component_12
to
multiple
destination
this
quality_attribute_9
be
very
helpful
below
be
two
example
of
how
this
quality_attribute_9
can
be
build
into
the
technology_2
architecture
connector_3
from
multiple
component_2
to
a
single
destination
centralized
connector_data_1
component_14
in
this
architecture
connector_data_1
can
be
connector_4
from
multiple
component_16
to
multiple
agent
the
connector_data_1
collector
pick
up
the
connector_data_1
from
all
three
agent
and
connector_10
it
across
to
the
destination
a
centralized
connector_data_1
component_14
connector_data_1
connector_4
from
a
single
component_17
to
multiple
destination
component_17
in
this
example
two
technology_1
agent
more
can
be
configure
base
on
the
requirement
pick
up
the
connector_data_1
and
pattern_6
it
across
to
multiple
destination
this
architecture
be
helpful
when
connector_3
different
set
of
connector_data_1
from
one
component_17
to
two
different
destination
for
example
technology_7
and
technology_8
for
analytical
purpose
be
necessary
technology_2
can
recognize
specific
component_2
and
destination
quality_attribute_10
technology_2
with
quality_attribute_3
component_1
and
technology_5
in
addition
to
be
able
to
connector_4
connector_data_1
from
multiple
component_2
to
multiple
destination
technology_2
can
quality_attribute_10
with
a
wide
range
of
technology_5
and
technology_12
it
can
connector_14
connector_data_1
from
almost
any
type
of
component_12
include
web
component_3
requirement_2
csv
generate
from
an
technology_13
component_1
and
similarly
technology_2
can
connector_9
connector_data_1
to
destination
technology_7
technology_8
and
technology_14
technology_2
can
even
quality_attribute_10
with
other
connector_data_1
connector_3
technology_5
technology_9
and
technology_11
the
example
below
illustrate
flume’s
requirement_5
capability
connector_3
requirement_2
connector_data_1
to
technology_7
from
twitter
a
mention
early
technology_2
can
connector_4
connector_data_1
from
a
web
component_12
twitter
to
a
directory
reside
on
technology_7
this
be
a
typical
requirement
of
a
real
time
scenario
to
make
this
happen
technology_2
must
be
configure
to
pick
up
connector_data_1
from
the
component_12
component_12
type
and
connector_11
the
connector_data_1
to
the
destination
destination
type
the
component_12
type
here
be
twitter
and
the
connector_11
type
be
technology_7
connector_11
once
the
connector_11
be
do
component_6
technology_11
can
perform
requirement_10
on
technology_7
requirement_2
connector_data_1
to
technology_7
from
twitter
connector_3
requirement_2
connector_data_1
from
technology_9
to
technology_7
use
technology_2
technology_9
be
a
connector_data_3
pattern_3
which
can
connector_4
live
connector_data_1
and
connector_data_4
generate
on
web
component_18
to
a
destination
a
component_1
if
you
need
to
connector_4
these
connector_data_4
to
a
location
on
technology_7
technology_2
can
use
technology_9
component_12
to
extract
the
connector_data_1
and
then
pattern_6
it
to
technology_7
use
technology_7
connector_11
requirement_2
connector_data_1
from
technology_9
from
technology_7
connector_3
requirement_2
connector_data_1
to
elasticsearch
technology_2
can
be
use
to
connector_4
requirement_2
connector_data_1
to
elasticsearch
a
popular
open
component_12
technology_5
that
can
be
use
to
quickly
perform
complex
text
search
on
large
volume
of
technology_15
connector_data_1
in
a
quality_attribute_3
environment
in
a
quality_attribute_7
manner
it
be
build
on

of
technology_16
and
leverage
technology_16
s
capability
to
perform
index
base
search
across
technology_17
technology_2
can
connector_4
technology_15
document
from

so
that
component_6
can
connector_15
the
connector_data_1
from
elasticsearch
the
technology_15
document
can
be
connector_4
directly
to
elasticsearch
quickly
and
quality_attribute_6
on
a
quality_attribute_3
environment
technology_2
recognize
an
elk

with
it
elasticsearchsinkcapability
elasticsearch
should
be
instal
with

so
that
it
recognize

requirement_2
connector_data_1
to
elastisearch
the
limitation
of
technology_1
technology_2
technology_1
technology_2
do
have
some
limitation
for
starter
it
architecture
can
become
complex
and
difficult
to
manage
and
maintain
when
connector_3
connector_data_1
from
multiple
component_2
to
multiple
destination
in
addition
flume’s
connector_data_1
connector_3
be
not
100%
real

alternative
technology_9
can
be
use
if
more
real

connector_data_1
connector_3
be
need
while
it
be
possible
for
technology_2
to
connector_4
duplicate
connector_data_1
to
the
destination
it
can
be
difficult
to
identify
duplicate
connector_data_1
this
challenge
will
vary
quality_attribute_11
upon
the
type
of

the
connector_data_1
be
be
connector_4
to
summary
technology_1
technology_2
be
a
quality_attribute_12
quality_attribute_4
and
quality_attribute_3
technology_5
that
can
help
connector_4
connector_data_1
