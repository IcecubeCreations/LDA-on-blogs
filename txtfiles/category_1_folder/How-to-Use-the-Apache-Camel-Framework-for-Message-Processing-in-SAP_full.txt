by

press
on
you
likely
that
from
a

perspective
requirement_1
flow
be
base
on

but
how
be
the
requirement_1
flow
interpret
and
connector_3
during

for
this
purpose
technology_4
requirement_2
component_3
requirement_1
rely
on
an

connector_4
technology_1
technology_2
or
technology_2
for
short
what
be

so
what
exactly
be
technology_2
it’s
a
connector_data_1
connector_5
and
mediation
component_5
interestingly
enough
technology_2
be
connector_data_2
agnostic
which
mean
you
can
fee
the

it
to

purpose
technology_2
can
handle

however
some

depict

to

you

look
this
let’s
briefly
go
over
the
part
that
make
up
an

exchange
a
unique

identify
the
exchange
mep
short
for

exchange
pattern_3
can
contain
two
possible
requirement_3
inonly
and
inout
inonly
be
when
a
connector_7
handle
a
one
way
connector_data_1
where
the
sender
doesn’t
wait
for
a
connector_data_8
from
the
receiver
hence
the
exchange
carry
an
in
connector_data_1
only
a
scenario
where
a
connector_data_1
travel
in
one
direction
only
and
where
no
connector_9
connector_data_1
be
expect
during
the
connector_10
be
also
a
pattern_4
connector_data_1
handle
inout
be
when
a
connector_7
handle
a
connector_data_9
connector_9
connector_data_1
the
sender
expect
a
connector_data_8
from
the
connector_7
which
will
be
component_8
a
an
out
connector_data_1
in
the
exchange
this
behavior
be
also
a
pattern_5
connector_data_1
handle
exception
if
an
error
occur
during
connector_data_1
component_1
the
reason
for
the

be
component_8
in

of

a
compare
to

component_1
requirement_1
be
the
quality_attribute_3
pipeline
concept
that
stand
behind
technology_2
in
technology_4
component_1
requirement_1
you
basically
have
three
fundamental
step
receiver
determination
determination
connector_data_10
in
addition
the
sequence
of
these
three
step
be
fix
it’s
not
possible
to
have
for
example
a
connector_data_10
step
before
an
determination
step
the
connector_data_11
be
a
rather
connector_data_1
component_1
environment
with
technology_4
requirement_2
component_3
requirement_1
this
connector_12
significantly
you
have
many
more
step
at
your
disposal
and
you
can
use
them
in
almost
any
sequence
that
your
scenario
require
conclusion
connector_data_1
component_1

in

we

itself
connector_data_6
