technology_1


be
come
this
year
and
it
will
bring
four
major
feature
perhaps
the
most
significant
be
a
component_2
type
connector_2
quorum
component_1
which
be
a
replicate
component_2
to
provide
high
quality_attribute_1
and
connector_data_1
quality_attribute_2
the
idea
be
to
replicate
a
component_2
across
multiple
component_3
so
that
in
the
of
a
component_4
crash
or
be
shut
down
the
component_2
continue
to
be
quality_attribute_3
and
without
connector_data_2
loss
technology_1
already
have
an
exist
solution
for
this
connector_2
mirror
component_1
or
ha
component_2
mirror
component_1
have
be
the
de
facto
way
of
connector_3
high
quality_attribute_1
and
connector_data_1
pattern_1
for
many
year
now
but
the
feature
have
some
serious
design
flaw
that
have
make
it
a
le
than
ideal
choice
what
be
wrong
with
mirror
component_1
anyway
the
coding_keyword_1
problem
be
around
the
synchronization
component_5
and
requirement_2
requirement_2
be
slow
than
it
should
be
because
connector_data_3
be
replicate
use
a
very
inefficient
algorithm
ha
component_2
synchronization
be
a
troublesome
topic
and
technology_1
administrator
live
in
fear
of
it
the
way
that
mirror
component_1
work
be
that
there
be
a
single
leader
component_2
and
one
or
more
mirror
component_2
all
connector_4
and
connector_5
go
through
the
leader
component_2
and
the
leader
then
replicate
all
the
command
connector_6
connector_7
ack
nack
etc
to
the
mirror
once
all
the
live
mirror
have
the
connector_data_2
the
leader
will
connector_8
a
confirm
to
the
pattern_2
at
this
point
if
the
leader
fail
a
mirror
would
connector_1
promote
to
leader
and
the
component_2
would
remain
quality_attribute_3
with
no
connector_data_1
loss
fig

leader
to
mirror
pattern_3
when
you
have
multiple
mirror
component_2
the
leader
and
mirror
connector_1
quality_attribute_4
around
your
cluster
so
each
pattern_4
can
component_6
multiple
leader
and
mirror
fig

leader
and
mirror
quality_attribute_4
across
a
cluster
the
basic
problem
be
that
when
a
pattern_4
go
offline
and
come
back
again
any
connector_data_1
it
have
in
mirror
connector_9
discard
this
be
the
critical
design
flaw
#1
now
that
the
mirror
be
back
online
but
empty
the
administrator
have
a
decision
to
make
to
synchronize
the
mirror
or
not
synchronize
mean
replicate
the
current
connector_data_3
from
the
leader
to
the
mirror
that
s
where
critical
design
flaw
#2
come
in
synchronization
be
block
cause
the
whole
component_2
to
become
unavailable
usually
if
everything
be
go
well
component_1
should
be
empty
or
have
a
small
number
of
connector_data_3
in
them
this
be
the
usual
healthy
state
connector_data_3
be
connector_3
publish
and
connector_10
at
the
same
rate
and
connector_data_3
remain
in
the
component_2
for
a
very
short
time
but
sometimes
a
component_2
can
grow
large
either
by
choice
or
because
a
downstream
component_7
be
slow
or
offline
in
the
meantime
the
component_7
remain
quality_attribute_3
but
accumulate
connector_data_3
in
it
component_2
if
you
have
no
connector_data_3
or
a
few
thousand
small
connector_data_2
then
the
impact
of
synchronization
be
small
synchronization
will
be
quick
and
pattern_2
can
resend
any
connector_data_3
that

t
connector_1
connector_11
by
the
pattern_4
while
it
be
unavailable
but
when
a
component_2
be
large
the
impact
be
much
great
it
can
take
minute
hour
or
in
very
extreme
requirement_3
even
day
to
synchronize
though
in
most
of
the
requirement_3
when
we
see
this
the
component_4
crash
before
it
finish
and
then
it
need
to
start
over
and
over
again
not
only
that
but
synchronization
have
be

to
cause
memory
relate
issue
on
the
cluster
sometimes
even
cause
synchronization
to
connector_1
stick
require
reboot
so
sometimes
administrator
simply
choose
not
to
synchronize
a
mirror
all
connector_data_3
would
connector_1
replicate
but
any
exist
connector_data_3
would
not
cause
reduce
pattern_1
and
connector_12
the
cluster
to
a
great
chance
of
connector_data_2
loss
these
issue
also
make
roll
upgrade
problematic
a
a
reboot
pattern_4
would
discard
all
it
connector_data_1
and
require
synchronization
to
recover
full
connector_data_1
pattern_1
quorum
component_1
the
next
generation
quorum
component_1
aim
to
resolve
both
the
requirement_2
and
the
synchronization
fail
of
mirror
component_2
but
it
do
so
with
a
reduce
set
of
feature
in
it
first
release
and
also
introduce
it
own
headache
unfortunately
we

t
have
an
easy
choice
to
make
quorum
component_1
us
a
variant
of
the
raft
technology_3
which
have
become
the
requirement_4
de
facto
quality_attribute_4
consensus
algorithm
it
be
both
quality_attribute_5
and
achieve
high
quality_attribute_6
than
mirror
component_2
connector_data_2
pattern_3
with
raft
each
quorum
component_2
be
a
replicate
component_2
it
have
a
leader
and
multiple
follower
a
common
term
to
refer
to
these
leader
and
follower
be
the
word
replica
a
quorum
component_2
with
a
pattern_3
factor
of
five
will
consist
of
five
replica
the
leader
and
four
follower
each
replica
will
be
component_6
on
a
different
technology_4
pattern_4
component_8
pattern_2
and
component_9
always
connector_13
with
the
leader
replica
which
then
replicate
all
the
command
connector_6
connector_7
ack
etc
to
the
follower
the
follower
do
not
connector_13
with
the
component_8
at
all
they
exist
only
for
pattern_1
allow
quality_attribute_1
when
a
technology_1
pattern_4
fail
be
shutdown
or
reboot
when
a
pattern_4
go
offline
a
follower
replica
on
another
pattern_4
will
be
elect
leader
and
component_10
will
continue
fig

raft
consensus
quorum
component_1
have
their
name
because
all
connector_data_2
pattern_3
and
leader
election
require
a
majority

a
a
quorum
of
the
replica
to
agree
when
a
pattern_2
connector_14
a
connector_data_2
the
component_2
can
only
confirm
it
once
a
majority
of
replica
have
connector_6
the
connector_data_2
to
disk
this
mean
that
a
slow
minority
do
not
slow
down
the
component_2
a
a
whole
likewise
a
leader
can
only
be
elect
when
a
majority
agree
to
it
and
this
prevent
two
leader
from
connector_15
connector_data_3
when
a
requirement_5
component_11
occur
so
quorum
component_1
be
orient
towards
consistency
over
quality_attribute_1
quorum
component_1
the
quality_attribute_7
part
firstly
component_8
don’t
need
to
connector_16
how
they
publish
and
subscribe
the
component_2
type
be
not
a
concern
to
those

the
only
difference
be
when
the
component_2
be
declare
it
must
be
declare
a
a
quorum
component_2
so
if
you
rely
on
a
component_12
to
do
component_2
declaration
you’ll
need
it
to
the
necessary
property
secondly
the
issue
of
synchronization
be
go
when
pattern_4
come
back
online
they
do
not
discard
their
connector_data_1
all
connector_data_3
remain
on
disk
and
the
leader
simply
replicate
connector_data_3
from
where
it
leave
off
pattern_3
of
connector_data_3
to
a
coding_keyword_2
follower
be
non
block
so
component_1
do
not
connector_1
so
impact
by
follower
or
rejoin
follower
the
only
impact
can
be
requirement_5
utilization
this
alone
make
connector_data_3
more
quality_attribute_8
than
mirror
component_1
a
there
be
not
the
risk
of
the
synchronization
problem
also
because
each
connector_6
must
be
connector_6
to
disk
by
a
majority
of
technology_4
there
be
no
risk
of
a
split
brain
scenario
cause
connector_data_2
loss
note
that
sometimes
no
quality_attribute_1
mean
connector_data_2
loss
if
a
pattern_2
have
no
recourse
but
to
discard
a
connector_data_2
then
an
unavailable
component_2
will
cause
connector_data_2
loss
outside
of
technology_1
itself
finally
raft
be
more
quality_attribute_9
than
the
mirror
component_2
algorithm
and
should
provide
quality_attribute_7
quality_attribute_6
so
far
this
all

up
to
quality_attribute_7
quality_attribute_6
quality_attribute_7
connector_data_1
quality_attribute_2
easy
roll
component_4
upgrade

o
patch
but
coding_keyword_3
s
start
look
at
the
downside
of
quorum
component_2
the
not
so
technology_5
part
le
feature
certain
feature
will
not
be
quality_attribute_3
in
the
first
release
or
never
the
connector_data_4
of

connector_6

quorum
component_1
have
a
different
disk
and
memory
profile
to
normal
component_2
normal
component_1
have
a
connector_17
storage
component_5
where
a
connector_data_2
be
component_13
once
and
all
component_1
that
it
connector_9
connector_18
to
simply
connector_1
a
reference
to
it
this
mean
that
in
a
pattern_5
component_5
the
fact
that
a
connector_data_2
will
be
connector_18
to
multiple
component_1
do
not
cause
the
on
disk
storage
size
to
grow
linearly
with
the
number
of
component_2
coding_keyword_3
s
take
the
example
of
a
fanout
with

bind
component_2
with
each
of
the
ten
component_1
be
a
mirror
component_2
with
a
pattern_3
factor
of

we
end
up
with

connector_data_3
component_13
across
the
cluster
for
each
connector_data_2
connector_19
to
the
fanout
exchange
=
connector_6
amplification
x5
quorum
component_1
on
the
other
hand
only
have
a
connector_17
component_5
in
memory
on
disk
each
connector_data_2
be
component_13
separately
so
pattern_5
create
a
connector_6
amplification
that
make
quorum
component_1
infeasible
or
require
high
end
disk
at
best
with
each
of
the
ten
component_1
be
a
quorum
component_2
with
a
pattern_3
factor
of

we
end
up
with

connector_data_3
component_13
across
the
cluster
for
each
connector_data_2
connector_19
to
the
fanout
exchange
=
connector_6
amplification
x50
fan
out
be
not
well
suit
to
quorum
component_1
and
massive
fanout
probably
isn
t
possible
at
all
memory
usage
all
connector_data_3
in
memory
all
the
time
the
fact
that
all
connector_data_3
in
quorum
component_1
be
always
in
memory
at
all
time
also
increase
memory
usage
to
the
point
that
you
can
end
up
cause
unavailability
of
your
cluster
if
unchecked
a
grow
component_2
could
cause
all
ingres
to
cease
until
connector_data_3
connector_1
connector_10
and
remove
from
memory
this
be
why
when
use
quorum
component_2
it
be
vital
that
length
limit
requirement_6
be
apply
and
connector_data_3
be
offload
to
lazy
component_1
via
a
dead
letter
exchange
this
make
plan
and
pattern_6
ever
more
important
a
downstream
outage
or
slowdown
could
cause
multiple
component_1
to
grow
and
you
need
to
plan
accordingly
how
many
quorum
component_1
do
you
have
what
be
the
expect
ingres
technology_6
what
other
component_1
could
be
impact
if
the
cluster
reach
it
memory
limit
permanent
loss
of
a
majority
=
lose
component_2
if
a
quorum
of
component_2
replica
be
permanently
lose
their
connector_data_1
be
go
forever
then
even
though
a
minority
remain
the
component_2
cannot
be
recover
and
must
be
force
delete
this
be
an
unlikely
scenario
but
the
risk
be
there
use
quality_attribute_10
disk
and
prefer
a
pattern_3
factor
of

to

quality_attribute_11
while
quality_attribute_6
be
quality_attribute_7
quality_attribute_11
be
high
this
come
down
to
the
use
of
raft
we

t
connector_1
non
quality_attribute_8
connector_data_3
and
all
connector_data_3
be
always
persist
to
disk
across
all
replica
quality_attribute_2
be
the
primary
goal
of
quorum
component_2
only
the
begin
quorum
component_1
be
still
in
beta
right
now
but
late
this
year
they
will
be
include
in
the


release
ready
for
production
usage
you
can
start
play
with
the
beta
version
now
which
be
pretty
quality_attribute_12
you
can
find
the
late


and


release
on
technology_7
the
first
release
of
quorum
component_1
aim
for
minimal
feature
concentrate
on
quality_attribute_13
and
requirement_2
the
technology_1
team
have
plan
to
improve
many
aspect
include
memory
usage
so
while
not
a
silver
bullet
by
any
mean
for
certain
use
requirement_3
quorum
component_1
offer
a
