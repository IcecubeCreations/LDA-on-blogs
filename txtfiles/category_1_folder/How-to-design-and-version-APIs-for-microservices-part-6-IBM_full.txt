how

in
this

part
series
on
pattern_1
component_3
development
we
provide
a
component_4
for
define
a
requirement_1
base
pilot
project
or

that
best
fit
current
need
of
your

along

tour
of

you
will
be
prepare

here
in

we
review
best
practice
for
create
and
maintain
component_1
within
an
component_3
and
between
a
requirement_1
quality_attribute_1
component_3
and
component_5
that
live
on
premise
this
be
a
guide
to
the
overall
series
an
overview
of
pattern_1
part

after
provide
component_4
for
requirement_2
pressure
require
fast
component_6
development
and
delivery
step
through
the
component_7
a
team
go
through
in
transform
a
specific
monolithic
component_3
architecting
with
pattern_1

lay
out
the
common
capability
of
an
architecture
for
rapidly
develop
component_8
base
on
a
pattern_2
connector_3
a

present
common
pattern_3
for
achieve
resiliency
in
your
pattern_1
component_3
design
and
versioning
component_1
this
part
offer
best
practice
for
manage
the
of
pattern_1
in
your
component_3
create
an
component_9
for
a
pattern_2
these
be
basic
principle
for
design
the
component_9
connector_4
by
a
pattern_2
the
first
of
which
be
enforce
strong
contract
a
pattern_2
provide
a
versioned
well
define
contract
to
it
component_10
other
pattern_1
and
each
component_11
must
not
break
it
until
it’s
determine
no
other
pattern_2
rely
on
it
the
second
be
to
avoid
chatty
require
you
to
perform
multiple
connector_data_1
to
accomplish
a
connector_data_2
connector_5
inefficiency
within
a
quality_attribute_3
component_12
inevitably
impair
component_11
requirement_3
and
quality_attribute_4
a
a
pattern_1
component_6
quality_attribute_5
third
be
to
make
a
connector_data_3
serialization
choice
base
on
requirement_3
who
be
the
component_13
of
the
technology_3
how
much
connector_data_4
be
be
transfer
in
each
connector_data_5
can
the
connector_data_4
be
compress
though
technology_4
be
currently
the
popular
technology_3
for
pattern_1
apis
capable
of
be
requirement_4
directly
into
an
connector_data_6
graph
it’s
not
a
compact
technology_3
a
an
component_9
designer
evaluate
technology_3
and
choose
one
base
on
requirement_3
requirement
lastly
use
desire
resiliency
a
the
guide
for
choose
pattern_4
vs
pattern_5
apis
pattern_5
component_1
quality_attribute_5
quality_attribute_6
but
be
more
complicate
to
design
and
use
pattern_4
component_1
allow
for
retry
when
the
resource
become
quality_attribute_2
this
be
one
of
the
most
important
aspect
of
component_9
design
because
it
affect
how
resilient
the
component_9
must
be
within
the
component_3
workflow
a
it
quality_attribute_5
use
component_9
design
pattern_3
the
component_9
gateway
pattern_3
be
use
to
abstract
the
connector_5
between
component_10
component_8
and
internal
pattern_1
this
allow
for
the
composition
of
pattern_1
into
component_10
ready
component_11
pattern_1
discovery
pattern_3
the
pattern_1
discovery
pattern_3
remove
couple
between
pattern_1
and
component_10
component_14
by
dynamically
register
pattern_1
in
an
requirement_5
topology
we
allow
component_10
component_14
and
other
component_15
to
dynamically
discover
pattern_1
and
adapt
to
connector_6
this
pattern_3
also
avoid
the
centralized
registry
pattern_3
of
traditional
pattern_6
monolith
pattern_1
description
pattern_3
the
pattern_1
description
pattern_3
express
feature
of
pattern_1
in
a
descriptive
technology_3
that
can
be
understand
by
component_10
component_3
it
also
offer
a
mean
of
manage
pattern_1
metadata
versioning
an
component_9
of
a
pattern_2
there
be
two
option
for
versioning
the
connector_4
component_9
of
a
pattern_2
if
you
need
to
provide
additional
connector_data_7
on
a
connector_7
or
coding_keyword_1

then
the
connector_6
be
unlikely
to
be
backwards
quality_attribute_7
in
that
requirement_6
you
need
to
look
at
way
of
handle
this
problem
the
two
most
common
way
of
handle
this
be
versioning
in
the
uri
versioning
in
the
coding_keyword_2
the
pattern_7
be
split
nearly


on
which
be
the
best
approach
for
this
so
we
present
both
uri
versioning
be
when
you
connector_6
the
uri
of
the
resource
itself
to
contain
version
connector_data_7
a
quality_attribute_8
example
of
this
from
our
bank
account
example
might
look

account
v2

{id}
this
approach
give
you
the
ability
to
version
an
entire
resource
hierarchy
or
branch
it’s
also
more
semantically
meaningful
to
developers—they
can
see
at
a
glance
which
version
of
a
component_11
they
be
refer
to
component_16
the
version
in
this
way
a
a
resource
enable
automate
navigation
or
discovery
of
resource
for
this
reason
we
recommend
it
for
most
purpose
a
disadvantage
of
this
approach
be
that
when
you
include
version
connector_data_7
in
the
uri
you
connector_6
the
resource
name
and
location
this
introduce
a
complex
proliferation
of
uri
alias
that
make
it
difficult
to
identify
which
version
of
your
component_9
be
the
currently
support
version
what’s
more
you
can
no
long
use
uris
to
compare
identity
in
this
approach
—
the
same
identical
connector_data_6
be
coding_keyword_3
by
both
the
version


and


uri’s
additionally
this
break
exist
hypermedia
connector_8
that
do
not
include
version
connector_data_7
you
can
connector_7
fancier
with
this
approach
but
this
make
it
troublesome
a
the
example
show
versioning
at
multiple
hierarchy
technology_5
–
complicate
connector_data_8
version

roadway
version

query
parameter
–
not
recommend
connector_data_8
version=2
uri
component_11
versioning
be
the
best
practice
for
update
the
coding_keyword_4
component_9
of
a
component_11
but
it
doesn’t
connector_9
any
break
connector_10
to
the
backend
connector_data_4
connector_11
that
need
to
take
place
there
be
two
option
for
deal
with
this
and
neither
option
be
great
option

copy
your
old
connector_data_4
into
a
“v2”
component_17
and
keep
the
two
entirely
separate
this
mean
that
either
you
live
with
connector_data_4
drift
or
you
put
a
connector_data_4
synchronization
solution
in
place
option

update
your
schema
in
place
and
to
v1
to
handle
the
schema
the
follow
image
show
these
two
option
coding_keyword_2
versioning
coding_keyword_2
versioning
be
another
approach
to
include
version
connector_data_7
in
a
special
coding_keyword_2
of
each
connector_data_5
or
connector_12
an
example
of
this
coding_keyword_2
might
be
x
version


an
advantage
of
this
approach
be
that
the
resource
name
and
location
remain
unchanged
throughout
your
hierarchy
so
you
won’t
have
a
proliferation
of
uri
alias
this
approach
make
it
easy
for
quality_attribute_9
pattern_8
to
requirement_4
the
coding_keyword_2
for
connector_13
in
scenario
where
you
have
an
esb
in
place
between
component_11
requestors
and
component_11
technology_6
likewise
by
keep
the
uri
the
same
across
version
the
component_9
remain
completely
semantically
meaningful
to
developer
a
drawback
to
this
type
of
versioning
be
that
connector_data_7
can’t
be
readily
encode
into
hypermedia
connector_14
what’s
more
this
approach
doesn’t
discriminate
among
multiple
representation
additionally
it
only
work
with
custom
component_18
that
how
to
encode
the
special
coding_keyword_2
thus
introduce
couple
into
your
design
what
to
do
next
whether
your
requirement_2
be
start
fresh
or
in
the
midst
of

there
