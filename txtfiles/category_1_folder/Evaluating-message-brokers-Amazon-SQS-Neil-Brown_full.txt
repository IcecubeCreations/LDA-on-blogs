let’s
break

operate

–
technology_1

be
architected
this
way
to
achieve
high
level
of
quality_attribute_11
and
pattern_5
this
be
essential
to
meet
the
requirement
of
most
requirement_2
however
the
technical
architecture
require
to
support
these
requirement
come
with
requirement_5
off
in
term
of
limitation
in
the
feature
set
that’s
support
by
the
connector_data_1
pattern_1
which
be
the
reason
for
the
‘simple’
in
sqs
these
requirement_5
off
and
limitation
be
discuss
in
more
detail
below
a
part
of
evaluate
individual
requirement
a
suggest
connector_data_3
of
functional
and
nonfunctional

you
should
consider
when
evaluate

each
of
these
requirement
be
elaborate
below
along
with
my
observation
on
how
well
they’re
support
by
sqs
pattern_2
style
a
primary
consideration
when
evaluate
a
connector_data_1
pattern_1
be
how
well
it
support
the
style
of
pattern_2
type
of
connector_data_1
pattern_3
need
to
meet
your
requirement
if
you
want
to
build
loosely
couple
point
to
point
requirement_3
in
which
connector_data_4
be
only
connector_6
by
one
component_9
and
or
you
require
a
component_6
of
connector_data_7
for
component_14
technology_5
to
component_15
asynchronously
then
your
connector_data_1
pattern_1
need
to
support
connector_data_1
component_6
if
you
need
to
quality_attribute_1
several
component_16
use
multiple
connector_data_1
type
and
some
of
those
connector_data_4
need
to
be
connector_6
by
multiple
component_16
a
might
be
the
cause
in
an
pattern_7
architecture
then
your
connector_data_1
pattern_1
need
to
support
the
pattern_8
pub
sub
style
of
connector_data_1
typically
use
topic
base
connector_data_1
pattern_3
our
immediate
requirement
be
only
for
component_2
to
support
a
component_14
component_6
for
a
point
to
point
requirement_3
however
with
one
eye
on
the
future
we
be
also
interest
in
pattern_9
to
reduce
the
no
of
point
requirement_3
we
be
build
and
allow
requirement_3
to
be
extend
without
connector_11
the
publish
component_16
technology_1
only
support
point
to
point
pattern_2
via
a
component_6
however
pattern_9
pattern_2
can
be
achieve
relatively
easily
by
quality_attribute_1
technology_1
component_2
with
quality_attribute_8
connector_data_8
component_17
sn
connector_data_1
connector_data_6
support
for
the
connector_data_9
you
need
to
include
in
connector_data_4
exchange
between
your
component_16
be
one
of
the
first
criterion
to
consider
when
choose
a
connector_data_1
pattern_1
what
content

type
do
you
need
to
be
able
to
connector_10
and
what’s
the
maximum
size
of
the
connector_data_6
you
need
to
connector_10
for
example
do
you
need
to
be
able
to
include
binary
connector_data_9
in
your
connector_data_1
or
if
not
what
character
set
s
need
to
be
support
technology_1
support
‘text’
non
binary
connector_data_1
body
only
include
most
of
the
character
in
the
unicode
character
set
the
support
character
set
be
define
by
the
connector_data_10
spec
because
under
the
hood
technology_1
us
connector_data_10
for
it
connector_data_11
exchange
technology_6
if
you
need
to
connector_10
binary
connector_data_9
then
your
connector_data_1
component_18
and
component_19
will
need
to
agree
on
and
apply
a
binary
encoding
technology_7
e
g
base64
themselves
binary
technology_1
connector_data_1
attribute
be
support
by
sqs
but
these
be
akin
to
connector_data_1

and
use
them
instead
of
the
connector_data_1
body
to
component_12
your
connector_data_6
whilst
feasible
will
reduce
the
quality_attribute_15
with
which
connector_data_4
can
be
connector_6
by
default
sqs’
max
connector_data_1
size
be
256kb
include
connector_data_1
attribute
be
that
big
enough
to
support
your
use
requirement_4
if
not
there
be
support
for
connector_12
large
connector_data_9
of
up
to
2gb
but
it
require
use
an
alternative
‘extended’
component_13
technology_4
which
connector_13
the
connector_data_11
‘out
of
band’
in
technology_8
which
have
additional
cost
a
of
now
i
don’t
currently
have
a
lot
of
experience
of
this
option
so
can’t
on
the
requirement_5
off
such
a
of
quality_attribute_12
for
more
detail
see
the
manage
large
technology_1
connector_data_4
use
technology_8
section
of
the
technology_1
dev
guide
in
our
requirement_4
all
of
the
connector_data_9
we
need
to
connector_10
be
text
base
and
relatively
small
a
few
kb
so
the
technology_1
connector_data_1
connector_data_6
restriction
be
not
a
showstopper
quality_attribute_12
when
quality_attribute_1
your
component_1
via
a
connector_data_1
pattern_1
rather
than
directly
you’re

at
least
a
couple
of
extra
requirement_6
connector_data_12
between
the
component_16
a
well
a
some
additional
component_15
overhead

assume

connector_14
the

connector_data_1

the

by
different
connector_data_1
pattern_1
will
vary
quality_attribute_17
on
a
no
of

include
whether
they’re

and
how
they’re

component_7
connector_data_12
make
over
the
net
the
quality_attribute_12
for
connector_12
and
connector_7
connector_data_4
will
therefore
always
be
an
order
of
magnitude
high
than
a
technology_3
base
connector_data_1
pattern_1
that’s
quality_attribute_2
in
your
connector_data_11

any
transit

the
pattern_1
be
“in
the
ten

the

if

in

significantly
a

place

what
we
find

an

your

offer
for

in

connector_data_1

be

feature
for

it
typically

feature
–

–
if
a

only
hold

those

a

this
inevitably

reduce

so
it’s
useful
to
be
able
to
disable
it
for
those
pattern_3
where
connector_data_11
loss
be
acceptable
if
that’s
support
by
your
pattern_1
quality_attribute_23
subscription
–
in
the
requirement_4
of
pattern_9
connector_data_1
a
connector_data_1
pattern_1
need
to
offer
“durable”
subscription
if
it
be
to

will
be

to
a

even
if
it
be

when
a

for

it
be

technology_1
do
offer
guarantee
connector_data_1

more
specifically
it
offer
“at

connector_data_1

the
significance
of
this
be
discuss
in
the
follow
section
on
connector_data_1
de

connector_data_1

order
for
many
component_1
it’s
imperative
that
connector_data_4
be
component_15
connector_6
in
the
order
in
which
they
be
connector_20
–
if
a
connector_data_1
hasn’t
be
connector_25
then
late
connector_data_4
either
must
not
due
to
requirement_2
rule
or
cannot
for
reason
of
referential
state
be
component_15
many
connector_data_1
pattern_1
guarantee
that
they’ll
connector_23
connector_data_4
in
the
order
they
be
connector_10
but
not
all
do
therefore
if
you
have
such
a
requirement
you
should
connector_15
whether
your
shortlist
connector_data_1
pattern_1
s
support
it
and
if
not
consider
the
implication
on
your
component_16
if
a
connector_data_1
pattern_1
do
not
support
connector_26
connector_data_4
in
the
order
they’re
connector_25
then
it
will
be
necessary
to
handle
that
in
your
connector_data_1
component_3
which
will
some
complexity
there
be
two
possible
solution
the
feasibility
of
one
of
them
quality_attribute_17
on
how
strict
your
order
requirement
be
if
you
only
need
to
satisfy
the
foreign
key
constraint
of
the
connector_18
application’s
connector_data_11
schema
which
require
that
one
type
of
component_27
which
be
create
by
component_15
an
early
connector_data_1
exist
before
another
type
of
component_27
which
be
create
on
component_15
a
late
connector_data_1
then
you
don’t
really
have
strict
order
requirement
in
a
requirement_2
rule
sense
in
this
requirement_4
it’s
often
possible
to
workaround
a
connector_data_1
pattern_1
which
doesn’t
provide
connector_data_1
delivery
order
guarantee
by
design
your
connector_data_1
component_3
to
support
component_15
connector_data_4
out
of
order
you
modify
your
persistence
component_28
to
create
the
early
component_27
in
an
initialise
state
and
populate
it
a
late
date
when
the
delay
connector_data_1
be
connector_21
you
have
to
be
able
to
connector_24
that
your
connector_data_11
be
inconsistent
for
however
long
a
connector_data_1
be
delay
typically
a
few
second
or
minute
if
you
really
must
not
or
cannot
component_15
a
connector_data_1
if
an
early
connector_data_1
hasn’t
be
connector_25
then
your
component_8
will
have
to
assume
responsibility
for
reorder
the
connector_data_4
prior
to
consumption
this
require
that
your
connector_data_1
component_29
or
pattern_1
if
it
support
it
include
a
in
the
connector_data_1
that
the
component_3
can
use
to
determine
the
order
in
which
they
be
connector_10
this
be
typically
a
sequence
number
that’s
include
a
a
connector_data_1

the
connector_18
component_8
will
then
need
to
detect
a
gap
in
connector_data_4
and
either
reject
or
buffer
the
component_15
of
late
connector_data_1
in
addition
to
the
extra
complexity
the
implementation
of
this
additional
component_28
have
the
potential
to
reduce
the
quality_attribute_20
of
your
connector_data_1
component_3
technology_1
only
make
a
“best
effort”
to
connector_23
connector_data_4
in
the

they
be

but
it
do
not

it
–
it
cannot
therefore
be
rely
upon
this
be
one
of
the

off
that

from

use
a

if
you
have

then
technology_1
not

choice
of

for
you
in

this

in

it

we
didn’t

there’s
a
risk
of
the

to
your

more
than

this
can
occur
in

scenario
for

if
a

occur
after

connector_27
a

the

will
resend
the

component_15
the

will
typically
either
lead

for
this
reason
be
able
to

or
handle
component_15
of

connector_data_1
be
often
essential
if
your
chosen
connector_data_1
pattern_1
support
detecting
and
remove

connector_data_4
it
will
make
life
much
quality_attribute_8
for
you
a
it
will
avoid
the
need
for
you
to
handle
them
yourself
in
your
connector_18
component_9
unfortunately
technology_1
do
not
currently
offer
any
such
support
note
–
this
have
now
connector_11
see
update
below
one
of
the
requirement_5
off
of
technology_1
be
architected
for
high
quality_attribute_13
and
quality_attribute_11
mean
it
only
offer
at
least
once
rather
than
exactly
once
connector_data_1
delivery
guarantee
what
this
mean
be
that
most
of
the
time
your
component_9
will
only
connector_21
a
connector_data_1
once
but
in
certain
error
scenario
such
a
the
one
describe
above
it
could
connector_21
a
duplicate
if
you
opt
for
a
pattern_1
such
a
sqs
which
only
offer
at
least
once
connector_data_1
delivery
guarantee
then
even
though
the
risk
of
connector_29
duplicate
connector_data_4
be
small
you
will
need
additional
component_28
in
your
connector_data_1
component_3
to
handle
them
your
connector_data_1
component_19
need
to
be
make
idempotent
–
component_15
the
same
connector_data_1
multiple
time
should
have
no
affect
on
the
state
of
the
component_9
broadly
speak
there
be
two
possible
solution
–
duplicate
connector_data_1
interception
compensate
requirement_2
&
persistence
component_28
preemptive
duplicate
connector_data_1
interception
this
solution
rely
on
your
connector_18
component_9
intercept
connector_25
connector_data_4
and
connector_30
whether
they
match
a
previously
component_15
by
any
other
component_3
one
before
it’s
component_15
there
be
a
couple
of
strategy
for
match
a
previously
component_15
connector_data_1
if
your
connector_data_4
have
a
unique

then
the
quality_attribute_8
strategy
be
to
component_12
and
query
the

of
all
component_15
connector_data_1
your
connector_31
will
need
to
perform
well
to
avoid
negatively
impact
connector_data_1
quality_attribute_20
use
a
quality_attribute_9
pattern_13
to
component_12
the
connector_data_1

will
offer
quality_attribute_5
requirement_7
but
there’s
a
risk
a
duplicate
won’t
be
detected
if
the
pattern_13
be
non
persistent
and
restart
or
the
pattern_13
entry
expire
before
the
duplicate
be
connector_21
the
latter
be
unlikely
if
the
pattern_13
be
size
appropriately
a
most
duplicate
be
likely
to
be
connector_25
very
shortly
after
the
original
connector_data_1
if
your
connector_data_4
don’t
have
a
unique

then
you
could
generate
and
component_12
a
hash
from
other
select
e
g
date
time
type
body
of
the
connector_data_1
and
match
on
that
instead
if
you
use
a
dedicate
connector_data_1
to
classify
a
duplicate
connector_data_1
rather
than
a
hash
it
have
the
benefit
of
allow
you
to
distinguish
component_4
generate
duplicate
connector_data_4
re
delivery
of
the
same
connector_data_1
from
component_21
generate
duplicate
connector_data_4
different
connector_data_4
with
the
same
content
e
g
double
click
submission
compensate
component_28
if
you
don’t
intercept
and
remove
a
duplicate
connector_data_1
then
you
will
need
to
design
your
connector_data_1
component_3
component_28
so
that
if
it
should
component_15
the
same
connector_data_1
more
than
once
it
doesn’t
connector_11
the
persistent
state
of
your
component_8
this
solution
boil
down
to
use
connector_data_15
in
the
connector_data_1
–
whether
it
be
a
dedicate
connector_data_1

or
one
or
more
contain

in
the
connector_data_1
body
–
a
a

that
be

then
often
the

alternative

include
the

it

that
all

your

if

you
additionally

then
a

could
be
a
valuable

ideally
the

if

the
component_6
and
delete
the
original
connector_data_1
from
it
component_6
although
you
can
connector_21
and
component_15
connector_data_4
in
pattern_11
of
up
to

this
be
very
inefficient
in
term
of
component_20
connector_data_12
and
bandwidth
usage
be
non
atomic
it
can
also
fail
leave
connector_data_4
on
both
component_6
and
both
the
original
and
copy
connector_data_1
exist
on
both
component_6
summary
before
adopt
a
connector_data_1
pattern_1
think
about
which
of
the
above
requirement
be
important
to
you
and
evaluate
how
well
a
pattern_1
support
them
an
important
early
decision
to
make
be
whether
you’ll
quality_attribute_2
and
operate
the
pattern_1
on
premise
or
use
a
saas
pattern_2
component_7
externally
component_37
and
operate
by
a
third
party
key
factor
in
this
decision
relate
to
requirement_7
and
cost
can
you
connector_24
the
high
quality_attribute_12
of
a
pattern_21
pattern_2
component_7
and
if
you
need
a
highly
quality_attribute_7
setup
do
you
have
the
in
house
expertise
or
budget
to
create
and
operate
it
additionally
a
connector_data_1
pattern_1
be
often
a
critical
part
of
your
component_4
architecture
so
before
opt
for
a
pattern_21
pattern_2
component_7
you
need
to
be
confident
that
the
people
operate
it
be
capable
of
meet
your
need
technology_1
be
a
fully
manage
quality_attribute_9
pattern_2
component_7
it
be
launch
back
in

a
a
pattern_2
component_7
it
and
feature
set
be
therefore
well
prove
battle
test
it
strength
include
quality_attribute_13
quality_attribute_11
dynamic
responsive
and
cost
quality_attribute_22
–
with
no
state
limit
on
the
no
of
connector_data_4
component_12
on
any
give
component_6
pattern_5
–
the
fact
that
a
copy
of
each
component_6
connector_data_1
be
component_12
on
multiple
technology_1
component_24
in
different
location
mean
that
technology_1
be
very
unlikely
to
ever
lose
a
connector_data_1
this
be
one
of
the
reason
it
can
offer
guarantee
connector_data_1
delivery
cost
requirement_11
for
money
–
zero
operate
cost
for
a
highly
quality_attribute_7
highly
redundant

low

two
dollar
for
several
million

to
use
–
technology_1

quality_attribute_8
to

have
an

largely
boil
down
to
provide

ease
of

improve
further
by
the
component_13

sdks
which
be

many
dev
component_33
sqs’
major
weakness
mostly
stem
from
the
design
requirement_5
off
which
have
be
make
to
offer
unlimited
quality_attribute_11
and
pattern_5
the
most
notable
limitation
be
–
pattern_2
style
lack
of
support
for
pub
sub
quality_attribute_12
pattern_2
feature
set
–
for
example
lack
of
support
for
connector_data_1
pattern_6
connector_data_1
delivery
order
–
connector_data_4
be
not
guarantee
to
always
be
connector_23
in
order
they
be
connector_10
only
best
effort
update
–
a
note
above
technology_1
have
since
be
enhance
to
support
this
connector_data_1
de
duplication
–
connector_data_4
not
guarantee
to
only
be
connector_25
once
only
best
effort
update
–
a
note
above
technology_1
have
since
be
enhance
to
support
this
the
recent
addition
of
support
for
pattern_12
component_2
be
an
indication
that
be
still
invest
in
the
component_7
benefit
exist
requirement_12
if
it’s
appropriate
for
your
pattern_2
use
requirement_4
e
g
component_8
requirement_3
persistent
work
connector_data_19
component_6
and
you
can
live
with
the
above
weakness
then
sqs’
benefit
be
compel
and
you
should
seriously
consider
adopt
it
rather
than
quality_attribute_2
and
operate
your
own
connector_data_1
pattern_1
we’ve
be
use
technology_1
in
production
for
around
a
year
now
and
our
experience
have
be
very
quality_attribute_5
–
we’ve
successfully
component_15
many
million
of
connector_data_4
without
any
issue
we’re
plan
to
use
technology_1
more
extensively
in
the
future
include
trialing
it
requirement_3
with
sn
to
support
for
pattern_9
connector_data_1
i
hope
you
find
this
useful
