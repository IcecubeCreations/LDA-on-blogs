introductiondata
requirement_2
be
a
set
of
component_1
use
to
connector_1
and
combine
connector_data_1
from

component_2
into
meaningful
and
valuable
connector_data_2
a
complete
connector_data_1
requirement_2
solution
connector_2
trust
connector_data_1
from
a
variety
of
component_2

traditional
connector_data_1
requirement_2
technique
be
mainly
base
on
technology_1
extract
transform
and
load
component_3
to
ingest
and
clean
connector_data_1
then
load
it
into
a
connector_data_1
requirement_3
nowadays
huge
volume
of
connector_data_1
be
connector_3
from
many
heterogeneous
connector_data_1
component_2
which
be
generate
connector_data_1
in
real
time
with
different
quality
—
which
be
connector_4
requirement_1
the
requirement_1
requirement_2
be
very
challenge
especially
after
the
traditional
connector_data_1
requirement_2
technique
fail
to
handle
it
we
can
say
that
requirement_1
requirement_2
differ
from
traditional
connector_data_1
requirement_2
in
many
dimension
volume
technology_2
variety
and
veracity
which
be
the
requirement_1
characteristic
volume
which
be
the
original
attribute
of
requirement_1
nowadays
the
number
of
connector_5
component_4
and
people
be
high
than
before
which
highly
influence
the
number
of
connector_data_1
component_2
and
the
amount
of
connector_data_1
worldwide
technology_2
a
the
number
of
connector_data_1
component_2
increase
the
rate
of
connector_data_1
generation
over
time
highly
increase
especially
after
the
appearance
of
social

and
the
use
of
iot
variety
more
connector_data_1
component_2
imply
that
we
have
more
variety
in
the
technology_3
in
which
connector_data_1
be
component_5
we
have
pattern_1
and
pattern_2
connector_data_1
in
high
level
in
each
type
we
have
a
huge
number
of
technology_3
text

sound
technology_4
document
spatial
connector_data_1
and
others
veracity
the
characteristic
connector_data_3
above
cause
that
we
have
different
connector_data_1
quality
so
we
can
find
uncertain
or
imprecise
connector_data_1
especially
that
social

and

allow
component_6
to
spread
this
kind
of
connector_data_1
in
this

we
be
try
to
give
an
overview
of
the

to
show
some

connector_data_4
basicsat
the
initial
stage
of
your

analysis
you
be
not
likely
to
have
the

level
of

over
connector_data_1
definition
a
you
do
with
your
operational
connector_data_1
however
once
you
have
identify
the
pattern_4
that
be
most
relevant
to
your
requirement_4
you
need
the
capability
to
connector_data_4
connector_data_1
element
to
a
common

that

carry
connector_10

connector_data_4
can
be
consider

phase
first
create
a
mediate
global
schema
then
identify
the
mapping
between
the
mediate
schema
and
the
local
schema
of
the
connector_data_1
component_2
to
determine
which
set
of

contain
the

connector_data_2

a
example
consider
that
we
be
connector_11
connector_data_1
about
“cricket”
player

we
have
three
connector_data_1
component_8
s1
s2
and
technology_13
each
connector_data_1
component_2
contain
different
attribute
a
show
in

first
we
identify
four
attribute
that
we
want
in
the
mediate
schema
which
be
the
name
the
number
of
game
play
the
total
score
and
the
team
then
we
do
the
connector_data_4
between
the
mediate
schema
and
the
connector_data_1
component_2
technology_14
a
show
in

after

first
we

after
look

s4
and
s5
we
find
that
technology_13
and
s4
be
identical
in
addition
there
be
only
one
difference
with
s5
therefore
the
weight
of
s4

in

the

discussionas
we
saw
in
the
previous
section
there
be
many
propose
algorithm
and
technique
to
connector_16
the
requirement_1
requirement_2
challenge
but
there
be
many
thing
that
be
not
take
into
consideration
in
these
proposal
first
all
proposal
be
consider
that
the
connector_data_1
be
well
form
and
the
connector_data_1
pre
component_3
extract
transform
be
do
but
when
talk
about
the
online
connector_data_1
we
be
talk
about
a
connector_data_1
generate
by
multi
linguistic
connector_data_1
component_8
even
if
the
technology_18
be
well
recognize
it
be
slang
in
addition
the
only
type
of
pattern_2
connector_data_1
that
be
take
into
consideration
be
the
text
but
other
type
be
frequently
connector_19
a
example

on
social

can
contain
video
audio
image
connector_data_10
and
other
type
in
addition
when
quality_attribute_1
connector_data_1
from
social


tweet

…
connector_data_1
have
mostly
a
very
low
quality
because
it
be
provide
by
normal
component_25
which
do
not
have
the
basic
skill
of
computing
and
connector_6
therefore
it
be
very
challenge
to
extract
useful
connector_data_2
also
all
proposal
require
first
to
build
the
component_19
offline
and
then
populate
online
which
cannot
always
be
do
in
real
world
when
it
be
about
the
veracity
and
variety
of
the
connector_data_1
we
cannot
always
analyze
the
connector_data_1
component_2
offline
sometimes
we
need
online
requirement_9
to
be
do
which
be
very
challenge
especially
if
we
take
into
consideration
the
issue
connector_data_3
above
in
addition
when
talk
about
connector_data_1
fusion
in
truth
discovery
connector_data_1
component_2
be
evaluate
base
on
which
contain
requirement_10
with
high
vote
the
requirement_10
provide
by
the
large
number
of
component_8
however
in
many
requirement_6
especially
when
talk
about
cyber
propaganda
false
connector_data_2
be
spread
widely
with
a
high
quality_attribute_13
to
persuade
so
it
be
not
true
that
the
requirement_10
provide
by
large
number
of
component_2
be
always
the
truth

connector_data_1
requirement_2
toolsthere
be
many
technology_7
use
in
requirement_1
requirement_2
some
of
them
be
use
in
traditional
requirement_2
component_1
and
be
enhance
and
quality_attribute_4
to
fit
the
requirement_1
need
in
addition
they
can
be
classify
a
commercial
and
open_source
the
follow
component_15
contain
some
of
these
technology_7

summaryin
this
report
we
give
a
brief
description
of
the
traditional
connector_data_1
requirement_2
technique
then
we
talk
about
requirement_1
requirement_2
challenge
and
we
describe
three
technique
use
in
this
domain
the
schema
connector_data_4
component_14
linkage
and
the
connector_data_1
fusion
in
addition
we
connector_data_3
some
of
the
late
research
topic
that
be
make
in
this
domain
finally
we
show
some
of
the
technology_7
that
can
be
use
