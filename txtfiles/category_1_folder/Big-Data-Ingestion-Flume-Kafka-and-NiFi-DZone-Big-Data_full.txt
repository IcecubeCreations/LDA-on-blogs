when
build
requirement_1
pipeline
we
need
to
think
on
how
to
ingest
the
volume
variety
and
technology_4
of
connector_data_1
show
up
at
the
gate
of
what
would
typically
be
a
technology_5
ecosystem
preliminary
consideration
such
a
quality_attribute_3
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_5
cost
in
term
of
development
time
etc
will
all
come
into
play
when
decide
on
which
technology_6
to
adopt
to
meet
our
requirement
in
this
we’ll
focus
briefly
on
three
technology_7
ingestion
technology_6
technology_1
technology_2
and
nifi
all
three
technology_8
offer
great
requirement_6
can

quality_attribute_2
horizontally
and
provide
a
plug
in
architecture
where
requirement_7
can
be
extend
through
custom
component_2
technology_7
technology_9
a
technology_9
deployment
consist
of
one
or
more
agent
configure
with
a
topology
the
technology_9
agent
be
a
technology_10
component_3
that
component_4
the
basic
build
block
of
a
technology_9
topology
which
be
the
component_5
the
pattern_3
and
the
connector_3
technology_9
component_6
connector_4
to
the
component_5
which
place
those
in
pattern_4
into
a
temporary
buffer
connector_5
pattern_3
and
from
there
the
connector_data_1
flow
to
a
connector_3
connector_6
to
data’s
final
destination
a
connector_3
can
also
be
a
follow
on
component_5
of
connector_data_1
for
other
technology_9
agent
agent
can
be
chain
and
have
each
multiple
component_5
pattern_3
and
connector_3
technology_9
be
a
quality_attribute_6
component_7
that
can
be
use
to
connector_7
aggregate
and
transfer
connector_8
into
technology_5
it
come
with
many
build
in
component_5
pattern_3
and
connector_3
for
example
technology_2
pattern_3
and
technology_11
connector_3
technology_9
be
configuration
base
and
have
pattern_5
to
perform
quality_attribute_7
transformation
on
in
flight
connector_data_1
it
be
easy
to
lose
connector_data_1
use
technology_9
if
you’re
not
careful
for
instance
choose
the

pattern_3
for
high
quality_attribute_8
have
the
downside
that
connector_data_1
will
be
lose
when
the
agent
technology_12
go
down
a
pattern_3
will
provide
quality_attribute_9
at
the
requirement_8
of
increase
quality_attribute_10
even
then
since
connector_data_1
be
not
replicate

the

either

both

nifi

there
isn’t

all

combine
technology_6
appear
wasteful
a
it
seem
to
introduce
some
overlap
in
requirement_7
for
example
both
nifi
and
technology_2
provide
pattern_6
to
connector_6
component_8
and
component_9
however
they
do
so
differently
in
nifi
the
bulk
of
the

component_19
lay
not
inside
the
component_11
component_9
but
life
in
the
pattern_6
allow
for

nifi
be
build
to
do
one
important
thing
well
connector_data_1
flow
requirement_10

nifi
can
