begin
a
a
way
to
electronically
exchange

this

time
and
money
and
improve
the
level
of

you
could

modern

have

to
provide
the
foundation
for

a

definition
would

in

b2b

the
major
benefit
of
b2b

revolve
around
enabling
the
collaborative
relationship
and
entirely
work
practise
that
drive
modern
supply

for
example
today’s
car
manufacturer
rely
on
their

to
typically
produce
up
to
85%
of
part
in
their
vehicle
in
addition
a

become

connector_5
the
type
of

that

manufacturer
create
be
changing–
in

a

of

carmaker
university

have
join
a
strategic

to
develop
the
country’s
intelligent
and
connector_2
vehicle
requirement_9
and
to
transfer
technology_1
into
mass
production
to
support
these
requirement_6
component_2
require
a
b2b
requirement_1
component_5
that
can
allow
for
the
fast
and
quality_attribute_7

between

ecosystem
in

insight
by

over
60%
of

will
rely
on

‘that
enhance

and
support
a

a
30%
of

the
type
of
b2b

there

this
be

edi
can
be

of
a
the

this
enable
quality_attribute_8

this
will
involve

the
best
b2b

component_6
provide
a
wide

both
type
of

what’s
the

–
with

early
edi
b2b

solution
focus
on
replace

component_4
with
automate
alternative
once
organization
start
requirement_11
electronically
it
become
clear
that
requirement_6
component_4
could
be
further
enhance
by
introduce

to
the

while
edi
remain
a

of
b2b
requirement_1
technology_1
there
be
an
additional
range
of
feature
that
you
should
expect
include
electronic
connector_data_3
exchange
the
first
step
towards
b2b
requirement_1
be
the
automation
of
key
requirement_6
documents–such

–that
replace

exchange
of
digital

global
partner
enablement
and
requirement_4
key
to
every
modern
b2b

solution
be

requirement_4
this
involve
technology_4
that
allow
you
to

the

‘100%

the
more
of

that
you
be

the
more
quality_attribute_12
your

you
will
realize
however
the
traditional

have
see

a

be
increasingly
digital
the


rule
be

and
organization
must
find
way
to
work
closely
with
all
their

this
be
a
challenge
for
b2b
requirement_1
because
there
be
a
vast
number
of

document
type
to

there
be
a
significant

of

with
a

each
requirement_11

be
likely
to
interpret

there
be
a

in

how
mature
be
b2b

today
b2b
requirement_1
and
solution
have
be
around
for
some
time
in
fact
a
early
a

the
yankee
group
estimate
that
over
90%
of

requirement_12
be
involve
in
b2b
requirement_1
and
requirement_11
activity
in
research
conduct
in

stanford
requirement_6
and
opentext
show
that
half
of
all
global
respondent
invest
more
than
$1
million
annually
in
b2b
requirement_1
technology_1
include
close
to
7%
of
requirement_12
with
an
annual
b2b
budget
of
more
than
$20
million
this
figure
have
grow
significantly
since
then
a
organization
understand
that
the
line
between
b2b
and
b2c
transaction
be
blur
–
80%
of
b2b
requirement_12
believe
that
requirement_10
expectation
have
connector_19
due
to
their
b2c
experience
however
research
from
scm

and
opentext™
show
that
there
be
still
some
way
to
go
in

of
the
maturity
of
the
actual
b2b

quality_attribute_13
within

scm

have
develop
a

scm

conclude
that
the
reason

be
that
‘management

this

in

to
these

b2b

be
develop
in
three
different
way
the
development
of
b2b
requirement_1
component_1
the
day
of
the
quality_attribute_5
connector_data_3
exchange
have
long
since
pass
and
now
requirement_12
require
a
range
of
b2b
requirement_1
component_1
that
allow
them
to
maximize
their
requirement_11
partner
relationship
this
involve
area
such
a
requirement_4
where

b2b
requirement_1
can
also
not
be

a
a

component_8
but
your
b2b
requirement_1
component_5
must
provide
component_1
to
manage
the
relationship
with
not
your
requirement_11
partner
but
also
their
component_7
and
increasingly
the
thing
that
be
connector_2
to
their
requirement_7
for
example
a
retail
supplier
require

the

a
the

grow
so
do
the
