connector_1
component_1
decomposition
right
those
build
soas
often
be
either
over
or
underdecomposing
their
component_3
by
david
linthicum
infoworld

there
seem
to
be
some
clear
trend
when
you
look
at
those
build
soas
they
either
break
out
way
too
many
component_3
or
not
enough
s
back
up
a
bit
the
core
notion
of
pattern_1
be
to
break
your
architecture
down
to
connector_data_1
and
connector_data_1
bind
to
component_3
thus
the
idea
behind
technology_6
with
the
s
be
component_1
however
many
be
take
component_1
decomposition
too
far
or
not
far
enough
perhaps
i
can
help
keep
up
on
development
in
pattern_1
with
infoworld
s
technology_7
architecture
newsletter
if
component_1
decomposition
appear
to
be
with
technology_6
it
s
really
not
the
fact
be
that
decomposition
a
a
design
technique
have
be
around
since
the
pattern_2
programming
day
when
we
do
component_4
decomposition
to
quality_attribute_1
define
component_5
before
we
turn
the
design
over
to
programmer
component_1
decomposition
in
essence
be
break
large
coarse
grain
component_3
down
to
small
fine
grain
component_1
quality_attribute_2
on
the
objective
of
the
architecture
many
decomposition
criterion
can
be
create
and
apply
this
criterion
have
a
huge
impact
on
the
architecture
include
agility
requirement_4
development
time
quality_attribute_3
complexity
thus
you
have
to
when
to
stop
decompose
component_1
no
matter
if
the
component_3
be
abstract
from
an
exist
component_6
or
component_5
or
build
from
scratch
but
how
here
be
dave
s
quick
and
dirty
tip
for
component_1
decomposition
make
sure
to
establish
architectural
criterion
around
component_1
decomposition
consider
the
connector_data_2
connector_data_3
above
make
sure
to
connector_4
it
down
and
connector_5
it
among
the
other
architect
for
instance
somebody
need
to
determine
how
coarse
or
fine
grain
a
component_1
need
to
be
to
provide
both
the
require
requirement_4
a
well
a
the
quality_attribute_3
a
a
rule
of
thumb
a
component_1
should
provide
a
single
bit
of
requirement_5
that
would
typically
take
le
than
line
of
3gl
e
g
technology_8
for
instance
verify_customer_credit_rating
which
be
direct
to
a
discrete
versus
process_customer_credit_application
which
be
more
about
many
combine
again
a
rule
of
thumb
make
sure
to
include
the
developer
in
the
component_1
decomposition
component_4
they
should
be
capable
of
you
what
a
quality_attribute_4
component_1
be
and
what
it
s
not
and
thus
when
you
re
over
or
underdecomposing
that
remind
me
what
be
beethoven
do
in
his
grave
decompose
forgive
me
