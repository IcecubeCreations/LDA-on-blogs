for

that
connector_9

what
this
mean
be
that
the

component_4
developer
can
embed
technology_8

an

technology_8
connector_15
connector_9
a
component_5
component_31
that
be
fully
quality_attribute_16
with

technology_8
provide
to
reduce
the

that’s
typically
connector_14
to

while
discuss
technology_8
connector_5
it’s
also
important
to
touch
upon

the
best
thing
about

connector_15
be
that
it

a

after

it
become
a

project
in

at
first
the
concept

use
requirement_7
of

flink
look

it
aim
to
be
a

there
be

free
the
