coding_keyword_3
tag
technology_6
quality_attribute_1
be
one
of
those
word
that
can
mean
very
different
thing
to
different
people
even
in
the
same
component_6
or
the
same
project
it’s
not
so
much
nuanced
a
it
be
that
the
definition
matter
on
perspective
quality_attribute_4
can
be
different
for
different
goal
there
will
be
upcoming
coding_keyword_3
on
connector_data_2
virtualization
in
memory
connector_data_2
grid
requirement_9
all
area
where
an
understand
of
your
current
and
future
need
resourcing
and
load
be
critical
for
plan
go
into
those
concept
it
help
to
understand
quality_attribute_4
not
“make
it
big
”
but
how
you
make
it
big
and
when
and
why
vertical
and
horizontal
quality_attribute_4
vertical
quality_attribute_4
and
horizontal
quality_attribute_4
be
probably
the
most
traditional
approach
to
quality_attribute_1
vertical
quality_attribute_4
refer
to

capacity
or
improve
requirement_10
by

resource
to
an
exist
component_7
horizontal
quality_attribute_4
refer
to
increasing
capacity
and
requirement_10
by

additional
component_8
to
the
pool
which
then
all
together
it
be
easy
to
illustrate
this
through
hardware
quality_attribute_1
though
it
be
certainly
not
limit
to
hardware
resource
you
could
make
your
web
component_9
perform
quality_attribute_5
by

more
cpu
and
ram
or
use
a
solid
state
drive
that’s
vertical
quality_attribute_4
or
you
could
improve
your
web
component_9
requirement_10
by

a
second
web
component_9
and
use
a
load
balancer
to
manage
traffic
cloning
or
duplicate
a
component_7
be
horizontal
quality_attribute_4
vertical
quality_attribute_4
can
start
hit
upper
limit
because
there
be
only
so
much
that
you
can
do
to
a
single
component_10
connector_data_2
or
load
be
still
in
one
location
and
it’s
spread
across
multiple
core
for
example
to
quality_attribute_6
the
load
horizontal
quality_attribute_7
be
quality_attribute_8
and
more
dynamic
because
you
need
to
component_8
to
a
pool
but
that
can
start
hit
inefficiency
a
well
especially
if
the
technology_7
be
simply
replicate
connector_data_2
between
each
other
or
can
encounter
connector_data_2
master
issue
a
component_11
and
load
become
more
complex
there
be
more
limit
on
how
quality_attribute_9
cloning
can
be
a
variation
of
horizontal
vertical
quality_attribute_4
be
to
introduce
connector_data_2
split
so
certain
type
of
connector_data_2
or
certain
be
locate
across
component_8
horizontally
which
be
optimize
for
those
type
of
load
vertically
that’s
the
xyz
technology_8
quality_attribute_4
x
y
and
z
technology_9
quality_attribute_4
not
all
or
component_11
need
the
same
thing
for
high
requirement_10
one
component_5
have
high
component_2
traffic
which
mean
it
need
a
component_7
with
high
cpu
and
memory
to
be
responsive
another
have
low
traffic
but
need
to
component_12
a
lot
of
connector_data_2
so
it
need
disk
space
or
some
kind
of
storage
component_13
even
the
same
component_14
a
component_15
need
to
be
both
high
volume
and
large
storage
but
need
that
requirement_10
for
different
component_3
at
different
time
instead
of

more
or
quality_attribute_5
hardware
or

clone
to
a
pool
connector_5
different
type
of
connector_data_2
to
different
component_16
can
be
do
by
handle
that
connector_data_2
in
different
way
martin
abbott
and
michael
fisher
define
this
a
a
quality_attribute_4
cube
in
their
book
the
art
of
quality_attribute_1
x
technology_8
quality_attribute_7
be
pretty
much
traditional
horizontal
quality_attribute_4
which
quality_attribute_6
the
total
load
across
a
give
number
of
technology_7
y
technology_8
and
z
technology_8
quality_attribute_4
however
be
two
entirely
different
approach
by
focus
on
different
thing
that
can
be
quality_attribute_4
y
technology_8
quality_attribute_7
refer
to
break
out
and
quality_attribute_6
component_5
this
be
connector_6
functional
decomposition
and
it
be
a
design
approach
which
be
reflect
in
pattern_2
and
pattern_3
architecture
this
break
apart
thing
that
be
different
base
on
those
difference
and
this
allow
an
architect
or
developer
to
put
a
give
component_5
in
a
geographic
location
or
on
certain
hardware
that
best
meet
it
need
y
technology_8
quality_attribute_7
can
be
a
quality_attribute_5
option
a
part
of
plan
component_14
development
among
a
lot
of
other
scenario
z
technology_8
quality_attribute_7
refer
to
connector_data_2
partitioning
it
be
a
way
of
quality_attribute_6
connector_data_2
among
many
technology_7
or
block
a
a
way
of
improve
requirement_10
think
of
it
a
register
a
child
for
camp
where
the
different
registration
boot
be
divide
by
surname
so
a
f
be
at
one
booth
g
n
at
another
and
so
on
the
underlie
connector_data_2
set
contain
the
same
type
of
connector_data_1
but
any
give
component_17
only
contain
part
of
the
connector_data_1
this
be
a
common
approach
for
storage

ceph

for
example
us
erasure
cod
a
connector_data_2

quality_attribute_6

with
some

us
in

grid
to
spread
subset
of
connector_data_2
across
multiple

all
in
the
systems’
ram
other
thing
that
aren’t
quality_attribute_4
but
still
matter
quality_attribute_1
within
a
component_7
tend
to
make
it
more
performant
by
increasing
or
quality_attribute_5
utilize
resource
and
more
resilient
by
have
multiple
component_8
quality_attribute_10
to
provide
component_5
because
of
that
discussion
of
quality_attribute_1
often
touch
on
some
concept
that

aren’t
really
quality_attribute_1
quality_attribute_11

requirement_10
quality_attribute_11
mainly

how
