i
talk
about
design
pattern_1
for
pattern_3
now
i
want
to
deep
more
deeply
into
the
most
important
pattern_1
in
pattern_2
architecture
inter
connector_1
between
pattern_3
i
still
remember
when
we
use
to
develop
monolithic
component_2
connector_1
use
be
a
tough
connector_data_1
in
that
world
we
have
to
carefully
design
relationship
between
component_1
component_3
and
connector_data_2
with
connector_data_3
component_4
now
in
the
pattern_2
world
we
have
break
them
down
into
separate
component_5
and
that
create
a
mesh
around
them
to
connector_4
with
each
other

s
talk
about
all
the
connector_1
style
and
pattern_1
that
have
quality_attribute_2
so
far
to
resolve
this
many
architect
have
divide
inter
connector_1
between
pattern_3
into
pattern_5
and
pattern_6
connector_5

s
take
these
one
by
one
pattern_5
when
we
say
pattern_5
it
mean
the
component_6
make
a
connector_data_4
to
the
component_7
and
wait
for
it
connector_6
the
component_8
will
be
block
until
it
connector_7
connector_1
back
the
most
relevant
technology_2
to
connector_8
pattern_5
connector_1
be
technology_3
technology_3
can
be
connector_8
by
pattern_7
or
technology_4
recently
pattern_7
have
be
pick
up
rapidly
for
pattern_3
and
win
over
technology_4
for
me
both
be
quality_attribute_3
to
use
now

s
talk
about
different
flow
use
requirement_7
in
the
pattern_5
style
the
issue
we
face
and
how
to
resolve
them

s
start
with
a
quality_attribute_4
one
you
need
a
component_5
a
connector_9
component_5
b
and
wait
for
a
connector_6
for
live
connector_data_5
this
be
a
quality_attribute_3
candidate
to
connector_8
the
pattern_5
style
a
there
be
not
many
downstream
component_9
involve
you
would
not
need
to
connector_8
any
complex
design
pattern_1
for
this
use
requirement_7
except
load
balance
if
use
multiple
instance
now

s
make
it
little
more
complicate
component_5
a
be
make
connector_data_6
to
multiple
downstream
component_9
component_5
b
component_5
technology_5
and
component_5
technology_6
for
live
connector_data_5
component_5
b
component_5
technology_5
and
component_5
technology_6
all
have
to
be
connector_10
sequentially
—
this
kind
of
scenario
will
be
there
when
component_9
be
dependent
on
each
other
to
connector_11
connector_data_5
or
the
requirement_8
have
a
sequence
of
to
be
connector_12
through
these
component_5
component_5
b
component_5
technology_5
and
component_5
technology_6
can
be
connector_10
in
parallel
—
this
kind
of
scenario
will
be
use
when
component_9
be
independent
of
each
other
or
component_5
a
be
do
an
orchestrator
role
this
scenario
bring
the
complexity
while
do
the
connector_1

s
discus
them
one
by
one
tight
couple
component_5
a
will
have
tight
couple
with
each
component_5
b
technology_5
and
technology_6
it
have
to
each
component_5
s
and
credential
solution
the
component_5
discovery
pattern_1
be
use
to
solve
this
kind
of
issue
it
help
to
decouple
the
component_10
and
component_11
component_12
by
provide
a
pattern_8
feature
component_9
b
technology_5
and
technology_6
can
register
themselves
a
component_5
component_5
discovery
can
be
connector_8
component_7
side
a
well
a
component_6
side
for
the
component_7
side
we
have
technology_7
alb
and
technology_8
technology_9
which
connector_13
connector_data_7
from
the
component_6
discover
the
component_5
and
connector_14
the
connector_data_4
to
the
identify
location
for
the
component_6
side
we
have
technology_10
eureka
discovery
component_5
the
real
benefit
of
use
eureka
be
that
it
pattern_9
the
quality_attribute_5
component_9
connector_data_8
on
the
component_6
side
so
even
if
eureka
component_7
be
down
for
some
time
it
doesn
t
become
a
single
point
of
failure
other
than
eureka
other
component_5
discovery
technology_9
etcd
and
consul
be
also
use
widely
quality_attribute_6
component_13
if
component_5
b
technology_5
and
technology_6
have
multiple
instance
they
need
to
how
to
do
the
load
balance
solution
load
balance
generally
go
hand
in
hand
with
component_5
discovery
for
component_7
side
load
balance
technology_7
alb
can
be
use
and
for
the
component_6
side
ribbon
or
eureka
can
be
use
pattern_10
pattern_11
handle
technology_2
if
component_5
b
technology_5
and
technology_6
need
to
be
quality_attribute_7
and
need
pattern_12
we
need
to
pattern_11
through
only
certain
connector_data_7
for
these
component_9
and
if
component_5
a
and
other
component_9
understand
different
technology_2
solution
component_14
gateway
pattern_1
help
to
resolve
these
issue
it
can
handle
pattern_12
pattern_11
and
can
convert
technology_2
from
technology_11
to
technology_3
or
others
it
can
also
help
enable
observability
metric
quality_attribute_6
requirement_1
pattern_13
and
quality_attribute_6
trace
apigee
zuul
and
kong
be
some
of
the
technology_9
which
can
be
use
for
this
please
note
that
i
suggest
this
pattern_1
if
component_5
b
technology_5
and
technology_6
be
part
of
manage
apis
otherwise
it
overkill
to
have
an
component_14
gateway
connector_15
further
down
for
component_5
mesh
a
an
alternate
solution
handle
failure
if
any
of
component_9
b
technology_5
or
technology_6
be
down
and
if
component_5
a
can
still
serve
component_6
connector_data_7
with
some
of
the
feature
it
have
to
be
design
accordingly
another
problem

s
suppose
that
component_5
b
be
down
and
all
the
connector_data_7
be
still
make
connector_data_6
to
component_5
b
and
exhaust
the
resource
a
it
s
not
respond
this
can
make
whole
component_15
go
down
and
component_5
a
will
not
be
able
to
connector_16
connector_data_7
to
technology_12
and
technology_6
a
well
solution
the
circuit
breaker
and
bulkhead
pattern_1
help
to
connector_17
these
concern
the
circuit
breaker
pattern_1
identify
if
a
downstream
component_5
be
down
for
a
certain
time
and
trip
the
circuit
to
avoid
connector_18
connector_data_6
to
it
it
retry
to
connector_19
again
after
a
define
period
if
the
component_5
have
come
back
up
and
close
the
circuit
to
continue
the
connector_data_6
to
it
this
really
help
to
avoid
requirement_9
clog
and
exhaust
resource
consumption
the
bulkhead
help
isolate
the
resource
use
for
a
component_5
and
avoid
cascade
failure
technology_10
requirement_4
hystrix
do
this
same

it
apply
both
circuit
breaker
and
bulkhead
pattern_1
pattern_2
to
pattern_2
requirement_9
connector_1
an
component_14
gateway
be
generally
use
for
manage
component_16
where
it
handle
connector_data_7
from
uis
or
other
component_17
and
make
downstream
connector_data_6
to
multiple
pattern_3
and
respond
back
but
when
a
pattern_2
want
to
connector_data_9
to
another
pattern_2
in
the
same
group
the
component_14
gateway
be
overkill
and
not
mean
for
that
purpose
it
end
up
that
individual
pattern_2
take
the
responsibility
to
make
requirement_9
connector_1
do
quality_attribute_1
pattern_12
handle
timeouts
handle
failure
load
balance
component_5
discovery
pattern_13
and
requirement_1
it
s
too
much
overhead
for
a
pattern_2
solution
the
component_5
mesh
pattern_1
help
to
handle
these
kind
of
nfrs
it
can
offload
all
the
requirement_9
we
discuss
above
with
that
pattern_3
will
not
connector_data_9
directly
to
other
microservicse
but
go
through
this
component_5
mesh
and
it
will
handle
the
connector_1
with
all
feature
the
beauty
of
this
pattern_1
be
that
now
you
can
concentrate
on
connector_20
requirement_10
component_18
in
any
technology_13
—
technology_1
nodejs
or
technology_14
—
without
worry
if
these
technology_13
have
the
support
to
connector_8
all
requirement_9
or
not
istio
and
linkerd
connector_17
these
requirement
the
only
thing
i

t
about
istio
be
that
it
be
limit
to
technology_15
a
of
now
pattern_6
when
we
talk
about
pattern_6
connector_1
it
mean
the
component_6
make
a
connector_data_9
to
the
component_7
connector_7
acknowledgment
of
the
connector_data_4
and
forget
about
it
the
component_7
will
component_19
the
connector_data_4
and
complete
it
now

s
talk
about
when
you
need
the
pattern_6
style
if
you
have
an
component_2
which
be
connector_15
heavy
the
pattern_5
style
might
be
a
quality_attribute_3
fit
especially
when
it
need
live
connector_data_5
however
when
you
have
connector_21
heavy
transaction
and
you
can
t
afford
to
lose
connector_data_5
component_20
you
want
to
choose
pattern_6
because
if
a
downstream
component_15
be
down
and
you
keep
connector_18
pattern_5
connector_data_6
to
it
you
will
lose
the
connector_data_7
and
requirement_10
transaction
the
rule
of
thumb
be
to
never
ever
use
pattern_14
for
live
connector_data_5
connector_15
and
never
ever
use
pattern_15
for
requirement_10
critical
connector_21
transaction
unless
you
need
the
connector_data_5
immediately
after
connector_21
you
need
to
choose
between
quality_attribute_8
of
the
connector_data_5
component_21
and
strong
consistency
of
the
connector_data_5
there
be
different
way
we
can
connector_8
the
pattern_6
style
pattern_16
in
this
approach
the
component_11
will
connector_16
the
connector_data_10
to
a
connector_data_11
pattern_17
and
he
component_10
can
listen
to
the
connector_data_11
pattern_17
to
connector_22
the
connector_data_11
and
component_19
it
accordingly
there
be
two
pattern_1
within
messaing
one
to
one
and
one
to
many
we
talk
about
some
of
the
complexity
pattern_5
style
bring
but
some
of
it
be
eliminate
by
default
in
the
pattern_16
style
for
example
component_5
discovery
become
irrelevant
a
the
component_10
and
component_11
both
talk
only
to
the
connector_data_11
pattern_17
load
balance
be
handle
by
quality_attribute_9
up
the
pattern_16
component_15
failure
handle
be
in
build
mostly
by
the
connector_data_11
pattern_17
technology_16
technology_17
and
technology_18
be
the
best

solution
in
requirement_4
component_22
for
connector_data_11
pattern_18
the
pattern_18
look
similar
to
connector_data_11
but
it
serve
a
different
purpose
instead
of
connector_18
connector_data_11
it
will
connector_16
detail
to
the
connector_data_11
pattern_17
along
with
the
connector_data_12
component_17
will
identify
what
the
be
and
how
to
technology_19
to
it
this
enable
more
loose
couple
there
be
different
type
of
connector_data_13
that
can
be
pass
full
connector_data_12
—
this
will
have
all
the
connector_data_5
relate
to
the
require
by
the
component_10
to
take
further
action
however
this
make
it
more
tightly
couple
resource
url
—
this
will
be
a
url
to
a
resource
that
represent
the

only
—
no
connector_data_12
will
be
connector_16
the
component_10
will
base
on
on
the
name
how
to
connector_11
relevant
connector_data_5
from
other
component_23
component_1
or
component_24
there
be
other
style
choreography
style
but
i
personally

t
that
it
be
too
complicate
to
be
connector_8
this
can
only
be
do
with
the
pattern_5
style
