in
this
we
will
try
to
compare
and
establish
some
difference
in
the
two
most
popular
connector_data_1
pattern_1
technology_1
and
technology_2
technology_3
whenever
we
want
to
quality_attribute_1
connector_data_1
pattern_1
into
our
component_1
which
allow
u
to
quality_attribute_2
easily
and
connector_2
our
component_2
in
an
pattern_2
fashion
there
be
many
connector_data_1
pattern_1
which
can
make
the
connector_data_2
from
which
you
be
make
to
choose
one
technology_1
technology_2
technology_3
technology_4
technology_5
technology_6
technology_7
each
of
these
connector_data_1
pattern_1
have
their
own
connector_data_2
of
pro
and
con
but
the
most
challenge
option
be
the
first
two
technology_1
and
technology_2
technology_3
in
this
lesson
we
will
connector_data_2
down
point
which
can
help
to
narrow
down
the
decision
of
go
with
one
over
other
finally
it
be
worth
point
out
that
none
of
these
be
quality_attribute_3
than
another
in
all
use
requirement_1
and
it
completely
quality_attribute_4
on
what
you
want
to
achieve
so
there
be
no
one
right
answer
we
will
start
with
a
quality_attribute_5
introduction
of
these
technology_8
technology_2
technology_3
a
we
say
in
this
lesson
technology_2
technology_3
be
a
quality_attribute_6
fault
tolerant
horizontally
quality_attribute_7
connector_3
requirement_2
this
mean
that
technology_3
can
perform
a
divide
and
rule
term
very
well
it
can
replicate
your
connector_data_3
to
ensure
quality_attribute_8
and
be
highly
quality_attribute_7
in
the
sense
that
you
can
include
component_3
at
runtime
to
increase
it
capacity
to
manage
more
connector_data_1
technology_3
component_4
and
component_5
technology_1
technology_1
be
a
more
general
purpose
and
quality_attribute_5
to
use
connector_data_1
pattern_1
which
itself
keep
component_6
about
what
connector_data_4
have
be
connector_4
by
the
component_7
and
persist
the
other
one
even
if
for
some
reason
technology_1
component_8
go
down
you
can
be
sure
that
the
connector_data_4
currently
present
on
component_9
have
be
component_10
on
the
filesystem
so
that
when
technology_1
come
back
up
again
those
connector_data_4
can
be
component_11
by
component_12
in
a
consistent
manner
technology_1
work
superpower
technology_2
technology_3
kafka’s
superpower
be
that
it
be
can
be
use
a
a
component_13
component_2
but
that
be
not
what
be
limit
to
technology_3
be
something
more
a
circular
buffer
that
can
quality_attribute_2
a
much
a
a
disk
on
the
component_14
on
the
cluster
and
thus
allow
u
to
be
able
to
re
connector_5
connector_data_1
this
can
be
do
by
the
component_7
without
have
to
quality_attribute_4
on
technology_3
cluster
a
it
be
completely
client’s
responsibility
to
note
the
connector_data_1
metadata
it
be
currently
connector_6
and
it
can
revisit
technology_3
late
in
a
specify
interval
to
connector_5
the
same
connector_data_1
again
please
note
that
the
time
in
which
this
connector_data_1
can
be
re
connector_5
be
limit
and
can
be
configure
in
technology_3
configuration
so
once
that
time
be
over
there
be
no
way
a
component_7
can
connector_5
an
old
connector_data_1
ever
again
superpower
technology_1
rabbitmq’s
superpower
be
that
it
be
simply
quality_attribute_7
be
a
high
performant
pattern_3
component_2
which
have
very
well
define
consistency
rule
and
ability
to
create
many
type
of
connector_data_1
exchange
component_15
for
example
there
be
three
type
of
exchange
you
can
create
in
technology_1
direct
exchange
one
to
one
exchange
of
topic
topic
exchange
a
topic
be
define
on
which
various
component_16
can
publish
a
connector_data_1
and
various
component_12
can
bind
themselves
to
listen
on
that
topic
so
each
one
of
them
connector_7
the
connector_data_1
which
be
connector_8
to
this
topic
fanout
exchange
this
be
more
strict
than
topic
exchange
a
when
a
connector_data_1
be
publish
on
a
fanout
exchange
all
component_12
which
be
connector_9
to
component_9
which
bind
itself
to
the
fanout
exchange
will
connector_10
the
connector_data_1
already
notice
the
difference
between
technology_1
and
technology_3
the
difference
be
if
a
component_5
be
not
connector_9
to
a
fanout
exchange
in
technology_1
when
a
connector_data_1
be
publish
it
will
be
lose
because
other
component_12
have
connector_4
the
connector_data_1
but
this
doesn’t
happen
in
technology_2
technology_3
a
any
component_5
can
connector_5
any
connector_data_1
a
they
maintain
their
own
cursor
technology_1
be
pattern_1
centric
a
quality_attribute_3
pattern_1
be
someone
who
guarantee
the
work
it
take
upon
itself
and
that
be
what
technology_1
be
quality_attribute_3
at
it
be
tilt
towards
delivery
guarantee
between
component_16
and
component_5
with
transient
prefer
over
quality_attribute_9
connector_data_1
technology_1
u
the
pattern_1
itself
to
manage
the
state
of
a
connector_data_1
and
make
sure
that
each
connector_data_1
be
connector_11
to
each
entitle
component_5
technology_1
presume
that
component_12
be
mostly
online
technology_3
be
component_4
centric
technology_2
technology_3
be
component_4
centric
a
it
be
completely
base
around
partitioning
and
a
connector_12
of
packet
contain
connector_data_3
and
transform
them
into
quality_attribute_9
connector_data_1
pattern_1
with
cursor
support
pattern_4
component_12
that
be
offline
or
online
component_12
that
want
connector_data_4
at
low
quality_attribute_10
technology_3
make
sure
that
the
connector_data_1
remain
quality_attribute_11
until
a
specify
period
of
time
by
replicate
the
connector_data_1
on
it
technology_9
in
the
cluster
and
maintain
a
consistent
state
so
technology_3
doesn’t
presume
that
any
of
it
component_12
be
mostly
online
and
nor
it
care
connector_data_1
order
with
technology_1
the
order
of
publish
be
manage
consistently
and
component_12
will
connector_10
the
connector_data_1
in
the
publish
order
itself
on
the
other
side
technology_3
doesn’t
do
so
a
it
presume
that
publish
connector_data_4
be
heavy
in
nature
so
component_12
be
slow
and
can
connector_13
connector_data_4
in
any
order
so
it
doesn’t
manage
the
order
in
it
own
a
well
though
we
can
set
up
a
similar
topology
to
manage
the
order
in
technology_3
use
the
consistent
hash
exchange
or
sharding
plugin
or
even
more
kind
of
topology
the
complete
connector_data_5
manage
by
technology_2
technology_3
be
to
act
a
“shock
absorber”
between
the
continuous
flow
of
and
the
component_12
out
of
which
some
be
online
and
others
can
be
offline
–
only
pattern_4
connector_14
on
an
hourly
or
even
daily
basis
conclusion
in
this
lesson
we
study
the
major
difference
and
similarity
too
between
technology_2
technology_3
and
technology_1
in
some
environment
both
have
show
extraordinary
requirement_3
technology_1
connector_4
million
of
connector_data_1
per
second
and
technology_3
have
connector_4
several
million
of
connector_data_1
per
second
the
architectural
difference
be
that
technology_1
manage
it
connector_data_4
almost
in
memory
and
so
u
a
big
cluster
30+
technology_9
whereas
technology_3
actually
make
use
of
the
power
of
sequential
disk
i
o
and
require
le
hardware
again
the
usage
of
each
of
them
still
quality_attribute_4
completely
on
the
use
