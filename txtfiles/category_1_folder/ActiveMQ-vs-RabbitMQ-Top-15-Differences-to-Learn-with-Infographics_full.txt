key
difference
between

and

let’s
discus
some
of
the
major
key
difference

technology_1
be
an
open
component_1
connector_data_2
pattern_1
be
scripted
in
technology_9
which
be
base
on
technology_9
connector_data_2
component_6
component_7
whereas
technology_2
be
connector_5
on
advance
connector_data_2
component_5
technology_6

technology_1
be
develop
by
technology_10
foundation
while
technology_2
be
develop
by
pivotal

technology_1
hold
technology_10
license


while
technology_2
hold
mozilla
coding_keyword_1
license

technology_2
work
base
on
the
center
which
make
this
a
unique
approach
technology_2
be
very
quality_attribute_2
and
component_8
friendly
because
the
huge
action
such
a
load
balance
or
persistent
connector_data_2
pattern_3
run
only
on
a
limit
line
of

but
this
approach
be
le
quality_attribute_3
and
slow
because
of
it
quality_attribute_4
addition
from
the
central
technology_7
and
size
of
the
connector_data_2
envelope
technology_1
be
easy
to
connector_5
and
provide
advance
feature
such
a
cluster
pattern_4
requirement_1
and
connector_data_2
storage

technology_2
be
embed
in
component_9
and
act
a
midway
component_6
it
differentiate
support
pattern_5
connector_6
connector_data_1
in
the
disk
a
pre
plan
in
requirement_2
of
an
outage
make
of
cluster
duplication
of
component_10
to
have
high
quality_attribute_5
it
be
quality_attribute_1
on
the
otp
component_11
that
assure
maximum
quality_attribute_6
and
quality_attribute_7
of
the
component_5
that
act
a
a
key

of
the
entire
component_2

technology_1
comprise
of
technology_9
connector_data_2
component_6
component_7
which
have
the
ability
to
support
multiple
component_12
or
component_13
the
attribute
component_3
cluster
support
the
technology_1
to
manage
the
connector_7
component_2
the
version
of
technology_1
be
technology_1
artemis
and
technology_1

classic
technology_2
be
connector_5
to
design
the
advance
connector_data_2
pattern_3
technology_6
it
be
stretch
out
to
support
different
technology_6
such
a
technology_11
and
stomp
some
of
the
feature
of
technology_2
be
rapid
pattern_6
connector_data_2
advance

connector_data_2
component_6


with
a
pluggable
architecture
here
there
be
a
separate
requirement_4
of
pattern_1
allot
for
distribution
load
technology_1
artemis
give
an
amaze
requirement_5
and
quality_attribute_1
in
pattern_7
architecture
for

of
pattern_8
component_9
with


and


of
technology_13
it
have
an
quality_attribute_9
cluster
for
quality_attribute_8
the
load
it
be
a
powerful
connector_8
that
provide
easy
migration

technology_2
have
many
advantage
that
support
multiple
pattern_8
technology_6
connector_9
acknowledgment
and
connector_data_2
component_5
it
be
enable
with
various
technology_14
such
a

net
and
technology_9
it
can
also
make
the
developer
use
component_9
such
a
technology_16
technology_17
and
puppet
it
give
high
quality_attribute_10
and
quality_attribute_11
by
develop
possible

it
