what
be

a
requirement_6
be
a
conversational
that
understand

â€“
which
mean
that
it
be
an
requirement_7
powered
component_2
that
respond
to
component_4
via
pattern_1
component_5

slack
and
skype
by
understand
natural

if
we
run
an
x
ray
on
a
requirement_6
so
we
now
what
a
requirement_6
be
but
want
to
dive
deep
and
see
what
it
be
make
up
of
what
component_1
do
it
need
to
operate
intelligently
and
give
an
outstanding

to
your

u
divide
the
component_1
within
a
requirement_6
a
essential
component_1
and
optional
component_1
and
then
discus
each
of
their
requirement_8
before
we
start
connector_2
out
the
video
below
essential
component_1
requirement_1

the
requirement_1
technology_2
be
the
heart
of
the
botâ€™s
implementation
that
can
be
connector_3
and
quality_attribute_1
similar
to
the
backend
component_7
component_8
of
a
web
or
requirement_9
component_2
it
act
a
the
central
pattern_2
that
handle
the
follow
connector_data_1
connector_4
connector_data_2
from

and
pattern_1

the
component_9
of
the

in
the
overall
conversational
dialog
connector_5
with

from

relate
connector_data_4
requirement_10
conversation
to
an
analytical

for

analysis
pattern_3
connector
the
pattern_3
connector
bring
together
the
botâ€™s
backend
with
the
component_6
which
in
this
requirement_11
be
pattern_1
pattern_3
messenger
skype
for
requirement_12
slack
and
others
the
connector
provide
the
pattern_3
support
of
requirement_5
along
with
connector_data_5
capability
that
allow
a

generic

help
to

any
possible

from

this
help
the

tree
to

example
i

component_9
component_14
every
conversation
that
have
multi

will
need

this
be
what
keep
the
conversation
go
in
pattern_1
pattern_3
which
be
pattern_4
in
nature
unlike
a
phone
connector_data_6
the
requirement_1
connector_7
it
component_9
component_14
to
identify
where
a
component_6
be
within
a
conversationâ€™s
dialog
and
hence
continue
from
that
point
onwards
this
requirement_8
allow
requirement_1
to
ask
follow

and
continue
conversation
over

sor
technically
this
be
not
need
for
a
requirement_1
to
operate
but
for
a
requirement_1
to
be
successful
we
feel
that
it
be
critical
requirement_1
feel
shallow
and
generic
when
they
lack
the
connector_8
to
the
requirement_13
a
travel
requirement_1
that
understand

you
be

what
your

speak
with

either
on

through
