even

solution
with

solution
we
risk
inconsistent

if

of

fail
—
such
a

the

succeed
quality_attribute_2

in
this
i’d
to
connector_4
some
of
the
technique
i’ve
for
make
connector_data_1
between
pattern_1
eventually
consistent
why
be
it
so
challenge
to
achieve
this
a
long
a
we
have
multiple
place
where
the
connector_data_1
be
component_4
which
be
not
in
a
single
component_1
consistency
be
not
solve
automatically
and
engineer
need
to
take
care
of
consistency
while
design
the
component_2
for
now
in
my
opinion
the
requirement_8
doesn’t
yet
have
a
widely
solution
for
update
connector_data_1
atomically
in
multiple
different
connector_data_1
component_5
—
and
we
probably
shouldn’t
wait
for
one
to
be
quality_attribute_3
soon
one
attempt
to
solve
this
problem
in
an
automate
and
hassle
free
manner
be
the
xa
technology_2
connector_5
the
two
phase
connector_6
2pc
pattern_4
but
in
modern
high
quality_attribute_4
component_6
especially
in
a
requirement_4
environment
2pc
doesn’t
seem
to
perform
so
well
to
eliminate
the
disadvantage
of
2pc
we
have
to
requirement_9
acid
for
base
and
cover
consistency
concern
ourselves
in
different
way
quality_attribute_5
on
the
requirement
saga
pattern_4
the
most
well
way
of
handle
consistency
concern
in
multiple
pattern_1
be
the
saga
pattern_4
you
treat
saga
a
component_7
level
quality_attribute_2
coordination
of
multiple
transaction
quality_attribute_5
on
the
use
requirement_10
and
requirement
you
optimize
your
own
saga
implementation
in
contrast
the
xa
technology_2
try
to
cover
all
the
scenario
the
saga
pattern_4
be
also
not
it
be
and
use
in
esb
and
pattern_5
architecture
in
the
past
finally
it
successfully
transition
to
the
pattern_1
world
each
atomic
requirement_11
that
span
multiple
component_8
might
consist
of
multiple
transaction
on
a
technical
level
the
key
idea
of
the
saga
pattern_4
be
to
be
able
to
roll
back
one
of
the
individual
transaction
a
we
rollback
be
not
possible
for
already
connector_6
individual
transaction
out
of
the
component_9
but
this
be
achieve
by
invoke
a
compensation
action
—
by
introduce
a
“cancel”
compensate
in
addition
to
cancelation
you
should
consider
make
your
component_10
idempotent
so
you
can
retry
or
restart
certain
in
requirement_10
of
failure
failure
should
be
pattern_6
and
reaction
to
failure
should
be
proactive
reconciliation
what
if
in
the
middle
of
the
component_3
the
component_2
responsible
for
connector_7
a
compensation
action
crash
or
restart
in
this
requirement_10
the
component_11
connector_8
an
error
connector_data_3
and
the
compensation
component_12
should
be
connector_9
or
—
when
component_3
pattern_7
component_11
connector_data_4
the
connector_10
component_12
should
be
resume
component_3
failure
to
find
crash
transaction
and
resume
or
apply
compensation
we
need
to
reconcile
connector_data_1
from
multiple
component_10
reconciliation
be
a
technique
familiar
to
engineer
who
have
work
in
the
financial
domain
do
you
ever
wonder
how
bank
make
sure
your
money
transfer
didn’t
connector_2
lose
or
how
money
transfer
happen
between
two
different
bank
in
general
the
quick
answer
be
reconciliation
in
accounting
reconciliation
be
the
component_3
of
ensure
that
two
set
of
component_13
usually
the
balance
of
two
account
be
in
agreement
reconciliation
be
use
to
ensure
that
the
money
leave
an
account
match
the
actual
money
spend
this
be
do
by
make
sure
the
balance
match
at
the
end
of
a
particular
accounting
period

bright
hub
come
back
to
pattern_1
use
the
same
principle
we
can
reconcile
connector_data_1
from
multiple
component_8
on
some
action
connector_11
action
could
be
connector_9
on
a
schedule
basis
or
by
a
pattern_8
component_2
when
failure
be
detected
the
quality_attribute_6
approach
be
to
run
a
component_14
by
component_14
comparison
this
component_3
could
be
optimize
by
compare
aggregate
requirement_12
in
this
requirement_10
one
of
the
component_15
will
be
a
component_16
of
truth
for
each
component_14
requirement_1
imagine
multistep
transaction
how
to
determine
during
reconciliation
which
transaction
might
have
fail
and
which
step
have
fail
one
solution
be
to
connector_12
the
status
of
each
transaction
in
some
requirement_10
this
requirement_13
be
not
quality_attribute_3
imagine
a
stateless
mail
component_10
that
connector_13
or
produce
other
kind
of
connector_data_3
in
some
other
requirement_10
you
might
want
to
connector_2
immediate
visibility
on
the
transaction
state
especially
in
complex
scenario
with
many
step
for
example
a
multistep
order
with
book
flight
hotel
and
transfer
complex
quality_attribute_2
component_3
in
these
situation
an
requirement_1
can
help
requirement_1
be
a
quality_attribute_6
but
powerful
technique
many
quality_attribute_2
component_15
rely
on
requirement_1
“write
ahead
logging”
be
how
component_1
achieve
pattern_9
behavior
or
maintain
consistency
between
replica
internally
the
same
technique
could
be
apply
to
pattern_1
design
before
make
an
actual
connector_data_1
connector_14
the
component_10
connector_15
a
requirement_1
entry
about
it
intent
to
make
a
connector_14
in
practice
the
requirement_1
could
be
a
component_17
or
a
collection
inside
a
component_1
owned
by
the
coordinate
component_10
sample
requirement_1
the
requirement_1
could
be
use
not
only
to
resume
transaction
component_3
but
also
to
provide
visibility
to
component_2
component_11
requirement_7
or
to
the
support
team
however
in
quality_attribute_6
scenario
a
component_10
requirement_1
might
be
redundant
and
status
or
status
be
enough
pattern_10
vs
choreography
by
this
point
you
might
think
saga
be
only
a
part
of
pattern_10
scenario
but
saga
can
be
use
in
choreography
a
well
where
each
pattern_11
only
a
part
of
the
component_3
saga
include
the
knowledge
on
handle
both
positive
and
negative
flow
of
quality_attribute_2
transaction
in
choreography
each
of
the
quality_attribute_2
transaction
participant
have
this
kind
of
knowledge
single
connector_16
with
the
consistency
solution
describe
so
far
be
not
easy
they
be
indeed
complex
but
there
be
a
quality_attribute_6
way
modify
a
single
datasource
at
a
time
instead
of
connector_14
the
state
of
the
component_10
and
emit
the
in
one
component_3
we
could
separate
those
two
step
connector_14
first
in
a
requirement_11
we
modify
our
own
state
of
the
component_10
while
a
separate
component_3
quality_attribute_7
capture
the
connector_14
and
produce
the
this
technique
be
a
connector_14
connector_data_1
capture
cdc
some
of
the
technology_3
connector_5
this
approach
be
technology_4
connector_17
or
debezium
connector_14
connector_data_1
capture
with
debezium
and
technology_4
connector_17
however
sometimes
no
specific
technology_5
be
require
some
component_1
offer
a
friendly
way
to
tail
their
requirement_1
such
a
technology_6
oplog
if
there
be
no
such
requirement_13
in
the
component_1
connector_18
can
be
pattern_12
by
pattern_13
or
query
with
the
last
component_3
for
immutable
component_14
the
key
to
avoid
inconsistency
be
make
the
connector_data_1
connector_14
connector_data_5
a
separate
component_3
the
component_1
component_14
be
in
this
requirement_10
the
single
component_16
of
truth
a
connector_14
be
only
capture
if
it
happen
in
the
first
place
connector_14
connector_data_1
capture
without
specific
technology_7
the
big
drawback
of
connector_14
connector_data_1
capture
be
the
separation
of
requirement_11
component_12
connector_14
capture
will
most
likely
live
in
your
codebase
separate
from
the
connector_14
component_12
itself
—
which
be
inconvenient
the
most
well
component_7
of
connector_14
connector_data_1
capture
be
domain
agnostic
connector_14
pattern_14
such
a
connector_19
connector_data_1
with
a
connector_data_1
requirement_14
for
domain
it’s
quality_attribute_8
to
employ
a
different
mechanism
such
a
connector_20
explicitly
first
let’s
look
at
the
single
component_16
of
truth
upside
down
what
if
instead
of
connector_21
to
the
component_1
first
we
connector_11
an
instead
and
connector_4
it
with
ourselves
and
with
other
component_10
in
this
requirement_10
the
become
the
single
component_16
of
truth
this
would
be
a
form
of
component_16
where
the
state
of
our
own
component_10
effectively
become
a
connector_22
component_18
and
each
be
a
connector_16
component_18
first
approach
on
the
one
hand
it’s
a
command
query
responsibility
segregation
cqrs
pattern_4
where
we
separate
the
connector_22
and
connector_16
component_18
but
cqrs
by
itself
doesn’t
focus
on
the
most
important
part
of
the
solution
—
connector_23
the
with
multiple
component_10
in
contrast
pattern_15
architecture
focus
on
connector_24
by
multiple
component_15
but
don’t
emphasize
the
fact
that
be
the
only
atomic
piece
of
connector_data_1
update
so
i’d
to
introduce
“event
first”
a
a
name
to
this
approach
update
the
internal
state
of
the
pattern_11
by
emit
a
single
—
both
to
our
own
component_10
and
any
other
interest
pattern_1
the
challenge
with
an
“event
first”
approach
be
also
the
challenge
of
cqrs
itself
imagine
that
before
make
an
order
we
want
to
connector_12
item
quality_attribute_9
what
if
two
instance
concurrently
connector_8
an
order
of
the
same
item
both
will
concurrently
connector_12
the
inventory
in
a
connector_22
component_18
and
emit
an
order
without
some
sort
of
cover
scenario
we
could
run
into
trouble
the
usual
way
to
handle
these
requirement_10
be
optimistic
pattern_16
to
place
a
connector_22
component_18
version
into
the
and
ignore
it
on
the
component_19
side
if
the
connector_22
component_18
be
already
update
on
the
component_19
side
the
other
solution
would
be
use
pessimistic
pattern_16
control
such
a
create
a
lock
for
an
item
while
we
connector_12
it
quality_attribute_9
the
other
challenge
of
the
“event
first”
approach
be
a
challenge
of
any
pattern_15
architecture
—
the
order
of
component_3
in
the
wrong
order
by
multiple
concurrent
component_20
might
give
u
another
kind
of
consistency
issue
for
example
component_3
an
order
of
a
requirement_7
who
hasn’t
be
create
yet
connector_data_1
connector_25
solution
such
a
technology_4
or
technology_8
kinesis
can
guarantee
that
relate
to
a
single
component_21
will
be
component_3
sequentially
such
a
create
an
order
for
a
requirement_7
only
after
the
component_11
be
create
in
technology_4
for
example
you
can
component_22
topic
by
component_11
so
that
all
relate
to
a
single
component_11
will
be
component_3
by
a
single
component_19
assign
to
the
component_22
thus
allow
them
to
be
component_3
sequentially
in
contrast
in
connector_data_3
pattern_17
connector_data_3
component_23
have
an
order
but
multiple
concurrent
component_20
make
connector_data_3
component_3
in
a
give
order
hard
if
not
impossible
in
this
requirement_10
you
could
run
into
pattern_16
issue
in
practice
an
“event
first”
approach
be
hard
to
connector_26
in
scenario
when
linearizability
be
require
or
in
scenario
with
many
connector_data_1
constraint
such
a
uniqueness
connector_12
but
it
really
shin
in
other
scenario
however
due
to
it
pattern_7
nature
challenge
with
pattern_16
and
race
condition
still
need
to
be
connector_27
consistency
by
design
there
many
way
to
split
the
component_2
into
multiple
component_10
we
strive
to
match
separate
pattern_1
with
separate
domain
but
how
granular
be
the
domain
sometimes
it’s
hard
to
differentiate
domain
from
subdomains
or
aggregation
root
there
be
no
quality_attribute_6
rule
to
define
your
pattern_1
split
rather
than
focus
only
on
domain
drive
design
i
suggest
to
be
pragmatic
and
consider
all
the
implication
of
the
design
option
one
of
those
implication
be
how
well
pattern_1
isolation
align
with
the
transaction
boundary
a
component_2
where
transaction
only
reside
within
pattern_1
doesn’t
require
any
of
the
solution
above
we
should
definitely
consider
the
transaction
boundary
while
design
the
component_2
in
practice
it
might
be
hard
to
design
the
whole
component_2
in
this
manner
but
i
think
we
should
aim
to
minimize
connector_data_1
consistency
challenge
connector_28
inconsistency
while
it’s
crucial
to
match
the
account
balance
there
be
many
use
requirement_10
where
consistency
be
much
le
important
imagine
gather
connector_data_1
for
requirement_15
or
statistic
purpose
even
if
we
lose
10%
of
connector_data_1
from
the
component_2
randomly
most
likely
the
requirement_11
requirement_12
from
requirement_15
won’t
be
affect
connector_19
connector_data_1
with
which
solution
to
choose
atomic
update
of
connector_data_1
require
a
consensus
between
two
different
component_2
an
agreement
if
a
single
requirement_12
be
or
when
it
come
to
pattern_1
it
come
down
to
the
problem
of
consistency
between
two
participant
and
all
practical
solution
follow
a
single
rule
of
thumb
in
a
give
moment
for
each
connector_data_1
component_14
you
need
to
find
which
connector_data_1
component_16
be
trust
by
your
component_2
the
component_16
of
truth
could
be
the
component_1
or
one
of
the
component_10
achieve
consistency
in
pattern_11
component_15
be
the
developers’
responsibility
my
approach
be
the
follow
try
to
design
a
component_2
that
doesn’t
require
quality_attribute_2
consistency
unfortunately
that’s
barely
possible
for
complex
component_2
try
to
reduce
the
number
of
inconsistency
by
modify
one
connector_data_1
component_16
at
a
time
consider
pattern_15
architecture
a
big
strength
of
pattern_15
architecture
in
addition
to
loose
couple
be
a
natural
way
of
achieve
connector_data_1
consistency
by
have
a
a
single
component_16
of
truth
or
produce
a
a
connector_data_6
of
connector_14
connector_data_1
capture
more
complex
scenario
might
still
require
pattern_18
connector_data_7
between
component_10
failure
handle
and
compensation
that
sometimes
you
have
to
reconcile
afterward
design
your
component_10
capability
to
be
reversible
decide
how
you
will
handle
failure
scenario
and
achieve
consistency
early
in
the
design
phase
