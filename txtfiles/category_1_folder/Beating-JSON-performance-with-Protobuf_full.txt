in

even

quality_attribute_1
quality_attribute_4
and
small

how
do
it
differ
from

it
be
important
to
note
that
although
technology_1
and
technology_6
connector_data_2
can
be
use
interchangeably
these
technology_14
be
design
with
different
goal
technology_12
which
stand
for
technology_3
connector_data_3
notation
be
simply
a
connector_data_4
technology_2
that
arise
from
a
subset
of
the
technology_3
programming
technology_8
technology_1
connector_data_2
be
exchange
in
text
technology_2
and
nowadays
they
be
completely
independent
and
support
by
virtually
all
programming
technology_8
technology_6
on
the
other
hand
be
more
than
a
connector_data_4
technology_2
it
be
also
a
set
of
rule
and
technology_15
to
define
and
exchange
these
connector_data_4

the
creator
of
this
technology_7
have
make
it
open_source
and
provide
technology_15
to
generate
for
the
most
use
programming
technology_8
around
technology_3
technology_9
technology_16
technology_10
technology_17
objective
technology_18
technology_19
technology_20
and
go
besides
that
technology_6
have
more
connector_data_1
type
than
technology_12
enumerate
and

and
be
also
heavily
use
on
rpcs
remote
connector_data_5
be
technology_6
really
fast
than
technology_12
there
be
several
resource
online
that
show
that
technology_6
perform
quality_attribute_1
than
technology_12
connector_data_6
and
etc
this
one
and
this
one
but
it
be
always
important
to
connector_2
if
this
be
the
requirement_3
for
your
own
need
and
use
requirement_3
here
at
auth0
i
have
develop
a
quality_attribute_2
technology_21
component_4
to
test
a
few
scenario
and
measure
how
technology_1
and
technology_6
perform
mostly
i
have
test
serialization
of
both
technology_7
to
make
two
technology_9
component_5
connector_1
and
to
make
a
technology_3
web
component_4
connector_1
to
this
backend
the
reason
to
create
these
two
scenario
technology_9
to
technology_9
and
technology_3
to
technology_9
be
to
measure
how
this
technology_7
would
behave
in
an
requirement_4
environment
technology_9
and
also
on
an
environment
where
technology_1
be
the
requirement_5
connector_data_4
technology_2
that
be
what
i
show
here
be
connector_data_1
from
an
environment
where
technology_1
be
build
in
and
should
perform
extremely
fast
technology_3
component_6
and
from
an
environment
where
technology_1
be
not
a
first
citizen
the
short
answer
to
the
question
be
yes
technology_6
be
fast
than
technology_12
but
this
answer
be
not
useful
nor
interest
without
the
connector_data_1
that
i
gather
on
my
experiment

s
take
a
look
at
the
detail
now
test
sampleto
support
the
measurement
i
have
create
three
technology_6
connector_data_4
connector_3
to
hold
the
street
and
number
person
to
hold
the
name
a
collection
of
connector_3
a
collection
of
requirement_6
number
and
a
collection
of
connector_3
people
to
hold
a
collection
of
person
connector_data_4
these
connector_data_2
be
assemble
together
in
an
component_4
with
four
pattern_3

one
that
connector_4
connector_5
connector_data_7
and

a
connector_data_8
of

thousand
people
in
technology_6
technology_2
another
one
that
connector_4
connector_5
connector_data_7
and

the
same
connector_data_8
of

thousand
people
but
in
technology_1
technology_2
a
third
one
that
connector_4
connector_data_7
with
any
number
of
people
in
technology_6
technology_2
a
fourth
one
that
connector_4
connector_data_7
with
any
number
of
people
in
technology_1
technology_2
technology_3
to
technology_9
communicationsince
there
be
a
lot
of
technology_3
component_7
quality_attribute_5
it
be
valuable
to
see
how
the
most
popular
of
them
behave
with
this
set
of
connector_data_1
so
i
decide
to
use
the
follow
browser
chrome
a
this
be
the
most
popular
browser
around
and
it
technology_3
component_6
be
also
use
by
technology_4
j
firefox
a
this
be
another
very
popular
browser
and
safari
a
this
be
the
default
browser
on
macbooks
and
iphones
the
follow
requirement_7
connector_6
the
average
requirement_1
of
these
browser
on

subsequent
connector_5
connector_data_7
to
both
the
technology_6
and
technology_1

these

connector_data_7
per
be
issue
twice
first
when
run
the
technology_21
component_4
with
compression
turn
on
and
then
when
run
the
component_4
with
compression
turn
off
so
in
the
end
each
browser
connector_data_9

time
all
these

thousand
people
connector_data_1
a
you
can
see
in
the
requirement_7
above
the
connector_data_10
for
the
compress
environment
be
quite
similar
for
both
technology_6
and
technology_12
technology_6
connector_data_2
be
9%
small
than
technology_1
connector_data_2
and
they
take
only
4%
le
time
to
be
quality_attribute_5
to
the
technology_3

this
can
sound
nothing
but
consider
that
technology_6
have
to
be
convert
from
binary
to
technology_1
technology_3
us
technology_1
a
it
connector_data_3
literal
technology_2
it
be
amaze
that
technology_6
manage
to
be
fast
than
it
counterpart
now
when
we
have
to
deal
with
non
compress
connector_data_4
the
connector_data_10
connector_7
quite
a
bit

s
analyze
the
requirement_7
below
on
these
situation
technology_6
perform
even
quality_attribute_1
when
compare
to
technology_12
connector_data_4
on
this
technology_2
be
34%
small
and
they
take
21%
le
time
to
be
quality_attribute_5
to
the
technology_3

when
issue
connector_data_9
the
difference
connector_8
almost
imperceptible
a
usually
this
kind
of
connector_data_9
doesn
t
deal
with
heavy
connector_data_4
more
frequent
than
not
these
connector_data_7
handle
the
update
of
a
few
on
a
form
or
something
similar
so
to
make
the
test
trustworthy
i
issue

connector_data_7
with
one
person
connector_data_4
and
a
few
property

connector_3
and
requirement_6
on
it
the
connector_data_10
can
be
connector_2
below
in
this
requirement_3
the
connector_data_2
size
be
not
even
different
mainly
because
they
be
so
small
that
the
meta
connector_data_1
about
them
be
heavy
than
the
connector_data_1
itself
and
the
time
to
issue
the
connector_data_9
and
connector_5
a
connector_9
back
be
almost
equal
a
well
with
only
a
4%
quality_attribute_1
requirement_1
from
technology_6
connector_data_7
when
compare
to
technology_1
connector_data_9
technology_9
to
technology_9
communicationif
we
be
to
use
only
technology_3
environment
technology_22
component_5
and
web
browser
a

i
would
think
twice
before
invest
time
on

and
migrate
to
technology_6
but
when
we
start

other
component_8
technology_9
technology_23
technology_19
etc
then
we
start
to
see
real
gain
on
use
technology_6
the
requirement_7
below
be
generate
with
the
average
requirement_1
of

connector_5
connector_data_7
issue
by
one
technology_21
component_4
to
another
technology_21
component_4
both
component_5
be
quality_attribute_6
on
different
virtual
component_9
component_10
by
digital
ocean
i
choose
this
strategy
to
simulate
a
common
scenario
where
two
pattern_4
be
connector_1
through
the
wire

s
see
how
this
simulation
run
now
this
be
a
great
requirement_1
improvement
when
use
technology_6
on
a
non
compress
environment
the
connector_data_7
take
78%
le
time
than
the
technology_1
connector_data_9
this
show
that
the
binary
technology_2
perform
almost

time
fast
than
the
text
technology_2
and
when
issue
these
connector_data_7
on
a
compress
environment
the
difference
be
even
big
technology_6
perform

time
fast
take
only
25ms
to
handle
connector_data_7
that
take
150ms
on
a
technology_1
technology_2
a
you
can
see
when
we
have
environment
that
technology_1
be
not
a
requirement_5
part
of
the
requirement_1
improvement
be
huge
so
whenever
you
face
some
quality_attribute_7
issue
with
technology_12
consider
migrate
to
technology_6
be
there
any
other
advantage
and
disadvantage
a
every
decision
that
you
take
there
will
be
advantage
and
disadvantage
and
when
choose
one
connector_data_4
technology_2
or
technology_7
over
another
this
be
not
different
technology_7
buffer
suffer
from
a
few
issue
a
i
connector_data_8
below
lack
of
resource
you
win
t
find
that
many
resource
do
not
expect
a
very
detail
documentation
nor
too
many

about
use
and
develop
with
technology_6
small

probably
the
root
cause
of
the
first
disadvantage
on
technology_24
overflow
for
example
you
will
find
roughly


question
mark
with
technology_6
tag
while
technology_1
have
more
than

thousand
question
on
this
same
component_8
lack
of
support
do
not
provide
support
for
other
programming
technology_8
technology_25
r
technology_26
and
etc
but
sometimes
you
can
overcome
this
issue
with
third
party
technology_27
technology_25
technology_6
provide
by
apple
non
human
readability
technology_12
a
exchange
on
text
technology_2
and
with
quality_attribute_2
connector_data_11
be
easy
to
be
connector_10
and
analyze
by
human
this
be
not
the
requirement_3
with
a
binary
technology_2
although
choose
technology_6
will
bring
these
disadvantage
along
this
technology_7
be
a
lot
fast
on
some
situation
a
i
demonstrate
above
besides
that
there
be
a
few
other
advantage
formal

how
do
we
use

now
that
you
already
that

be
fast
than
technology_1
and
you
also
it
advantage
and
disadvantage

s
take
a
look
on
how
to
use
this
technology_14
technology_6
have
three
component_12
that
we
have
to
deal
with
connector_data_4
descriptor
when
use
technology_6
we
have
to
define
our
connector_data_2
connector_data_12
in
proto

connector_data_4
implementation
connector_data_2
definition
be
not
enough
to
represent
and
exchange
connector_data_1
in
any
programming
technology_8
we
have
to
generate

connector_data_3
to
deal
with
connector_data_1
in
the
chosen
programming
technology_8
luckily
provide
generator
for
the
most
common
programming
technology_8
requirement_8
and
serialization
after
define
and
create
technology_6
connector_data_4
we
need
to
be
able
to
exchange
these
connector_data_4
help
u
here
again
a
long
a
we
use
one
of
the
support
programming
technology_8

s
catch
a
glimpse
of
each
of
component_13
technology_6
connector_data_4
definitionas
already
mention
connector_data_2
on
technology_6
be
describe
in
proto

below
you
can
find
an
example
of
the
three
connector_data_4
descriptor
that
i
use
in
my
requirement_1
test
i
have
define
all
of
them
in
the
same

which
i
connector_11
people
proto

number
=

}the
three
connector_data_2
above
be
very
quality_attribute_2
and
easy
to
understand
the
first
connector_data_4
people
contain
a
collection
of
person
connector_data_4
the
second
connector_data_4
person
contain
a
name
of
type

a
collection
of
connector_3
connector_data_4
a
collection
of
requirement_6
number
that
be
hold
a
and
lastly
a
collection
of
connector_3
also
hold
a

the
third
connector_data_4
connector_3
contain
two
property
the
first
one
be
street
of
type

and
the
second
one
be
number
of
type
int32
besides
these
definition
there
be
three
line
at
the
top
of
the

that
help
the
generator
first
there
be
a
syntax
define
with
the
requirement_9
proto3
this
be
the
version
of
technology_6
that
i
m
use
which
a
the
time
of
connector_12
it
be
the
late
version
it
be
important
to
note
that
previous
version
of
technology_6
use
to
allow
the
developer
to
be
more
restrictive
about
the
connector_data_2
that
they
exchange
through
the
usage
of
the
require
keyword
this
be
now
deprecate
and
not
quality_attribute_5
anymore
second
there
be
a
package
demo
definition
this
configuration
be
use
to
nest
the
generate

connector_data_3
create
third
there
be
a
option
java_package
definition
this
configuration
be
also
use
by
the
generator
to
nest
the
generate
component_14
the
difference
here
be
that
this
be
apply
to
technology_9
only
i
have
use
both
configuration
to
make
the
generator
behave
differently
when
create
to
technology_9
and
when
create
to
technology_3
that
be
technology_9
be
create
on
technology_28
auth0
technology_6
package
and
technology_3
connector_data_13
be
create
under
demo
there
be
a
lot
more
option
and
connector_data_1
type
quality_attribute_5
on
technology_6
have
a
very
quality_attribute_1
documentation
on
this
regard
over
here
connector_data_4
implementationsto
generate
the
component_14
for
the
proto
connector_data_4
i
have
use
two
technology_27
for
technology_9
i
have
use
the
technology_7
compiler
provide
by

this
component_15
on
technology_7
buffer
documentation
explain
how
to
install
it
a
i
use
brew
on
my
macbook
it
be
a
matter
of
issue
brew
install
technology_6
for
technology_3
i
have
use
technology_6
j
you
can
find
it
component_14
and
instruction
over
here
for
most
of
the
support
programming
technology_8
technology_19
technology_10
etc

s
technology_7
compiler
will
be
quality_attribute_1
enough
but
for
technology_3
technology_6
j
be
quality_attribute_1
since
it
have
quality_attribute_1
documentation
quality_attribute_1
support
and
quality_attribute_1
requirement_1
i
have
also
run
the
requirement_1
test
with
the

with
it
i
connector_5
bad
connector_data_10
than
i
connector_5
with

i
also
need
a

there
be
a

that
help
me
on

technology_22
component_5
with

be
easy
and
bring
a
lot
of
great
feature
to
the
component_16
with

we
only
have
to
connector_12

in
the
follow
section
we
be
go
to
how
to
use

to
quality_attribute_8
technology_22
component_17
connector_12
with
express
create
the
express
apilet
s
start
by
define
our
technology_22
technology_39
with
express
and
technology_4
j
we
can
do
this
in
two
quality_attribute_2
step
the
first
one
be
to
use
npm
to
install
three
connector_13
npm
i
express
body
requirement_12
cors
note
if
we
be
start
from
scratch
we
will
have
to
initialize
an
npm
project
first
npm
init
y
this
will
make
npm
create
a
project
in
the
current
directory
a
such
before
run
this
command
we
have
to
create
a
directory
for
our
project
and
move
into
it
the
second
one
be
to
create
a
technology_22
script
with
the
follow
we
can
connector_data_5
it
index
j

connector_13
express

}
start
express
component_18
listen

=
console
requirement_10
example
component_18
listen
on
port

the
above
create
the
express
component_4
and

two
technology_40
to
it
body
requirement_12
to
requirement_8
technology_1
connector_data_9
and
cors
to
signal
that
the
component_18
connector_4
connector_data_7
from
any
origin
the
component_18
also
register
two
on
express
to
deal
with
and
connector_5
connector_data_9
both
use
the

a
some
sort
of
in
memory
component_19
now
we
can
run
and
test
our
component_4
by
issue
technology_4
index
in
the
project
root
and
then
by
submit
connector_data_7
to
it
for
example
with
curl
we
can
connector_17
a
connector_5
connector_data_9
by
issue
curl
localhost


this
command
will
output
the
connector_data_14
in
the


register
the
component_20
at
auth0after
create
our
component_4
we
can
focus
on
quality_attribute_8
it

s
start
by
register
an
component_20
on
auth0
to
represent
our
component_18
to
do
this

s
head
to
the
component_20
section
of
our
requirement_11
requirement_13
we
can
create
a
free
account
if
need
and
click
on
create
technology_39
on
the
dialog
that
appear
we
can
name
our
component_20
a

technology_39
the
name
isn
t
really
important
and
identify
it
a
technology_33


sample
technology_28
we
will
use
this
requirement_9
late
quality_attribute_8
express
with
auth0now
that
we
have
register
the
component_20
in
our
auth0
account

s
quality_attribute_8
the
express
component_20
with
auth0

s
start
by
instal
three
connector_13
with
npm
npm
i
express
jwt
jwks
rsa
then

s
create
a
connector_11
auth0
j
and
use
these
connector_13

jwt
=
require
express
jwt
jwksrsa
=
require
jwks

export

}
the
goal
of
this
script
be
to
export
an
express
technology_40
that
guarantee
that
connector_data_7
have
an
access_token
issue
by
a
trust
worthy
party
in
this
requirement_3
auth0
note
that
this
script
expect
to
find
two
environment
variable
auth0_audience
the
identifier
of
our
component_20
technology_33

mycompany
technology_28
auth0_domain
our
domain
at
auth0
in
my
requirement_3
bk
sample
auth0
technology_28
we
will
set
these
variable
soons
but
it
be
important
to
understand
that
the
domain
variable
define
how
the
technology_40
find
the
sign
key
after
create
this
technology_40
we
can
update
our
index
j
to
and
use
it
other
require
statement
auth0
=
require
auth0
component_18
definition
and

redefine
both
component_18

connector_17

component_18


auth0
req
re
=
{

connector_15
req
body
re
connector_17
}
component_18
listen
in
this
requirement_3
we
have
replace
the
previous
definition
of
our
to
use
the
technology_40
that
enforce
connector_data_7
to
be
connector_18
with
valid
connector_19
connector_data_15
run
the
component_4
now
be
slightly
different
a
we
need
to
set
the
environment
variable
export
auth0_domain=blog
sample
auth0
technology_28
export
auth0_audience=
technology_33


sample
technology_28
technology_4
indexafter
run
the
technology_39
we
can
test
it
to
see
if
it
be
properly
quality_attribute_8
so

s
open
a
terminal
and
issue
the
follow
command
curl
localhost

contactsif
we
set
up
everything
together
we
will
connector_5
a
connector_9
from
the
component_11
say
that
no
pattern_8
connector_data_15
be
find
now
to
be
able
to
connector_20
with
our
again
we
will
have
to
obtain
an
connector_19
connector_data_15
from
auth0
there
be
multiple
way
to
do
this
and
the
strategy
that
we
will
use
quality_attribute_9
on
the
type
of
the
component_22
component_4
we
be
develop
for
example
if
we
be
develop
a
single
component_15
component_4
spa
we
will
use
what
be
connector_11
the
implicit
grant
if
we
be
develop
a
requirement_6
component_4
we
will
use
the
pattern_8
grant
flow
with
pkce
there
be
other
flow
quality_attribute_5
at
auth0
however
for
a
quality_attribute_2
test
this
one
we
can
use
our
auth0
requirement_13
to
connector_5
one
therefore
we
can
head
back
to
the
component_17
section
in
our
auth0
requirement_13
click
on
the
component_20
we
create
before
and
then
click
on
the
test
section
of
this
technology_39
there
we
will
find
a
connector_11
copy
connector_data_15

s
click
on
this
to
copy
an
connector_19
connector_data_15
to
our
clipboard
after
copy
this
connector_data_15
we
can
open
a
terminal
and
issue
the
follow
command
#
create
a
variable
with
our
connector_data_15
access_token=
our_access_token
#
use
this
variable
to
fetch

curl
h
pattern_8
bearer
$access_token
technology_33
localhost


note
we
will
have
to
replace
our_access_token
with
the
connector_data_15
we
copy
from
our
requirement_13
a
we
be
now
use
our
connector_19
connector_data_15
on
the
connector_data_7
we
be
connector_21
to
our
technology_39
we
will
manage
to
connector_5
the
connector_data_8
of

again
that
s
how
we
quality_attribute_8
our
technology_22
backend
technology_39
easy
right
conclusioni
have
to
be
honest
i
be
hop
to
come
across
a
more
favorable
scenario
for
technology_6
of

be
able
to
handle
on
a
technology_9
to
technology_9
connector_22

thousand
instance
of
person
connector_data_13
in
25ms
with
technology_6
while
technology_1
take
150ms
be
amaze
but
on
a
technology_3
environment
these
gain
be
much
lower
technology_6
technology_7
to
exchange
connector_data_1
between
component_23
can
bring
great
requirement_1
tweet
thisnevertheless
consider
that
technology_1
be
requirement_5
to
technology_3
component_6
technology_6
still
manage
to
be
fast
also
one
important
thing
that
i
notice
be
that
even
though
there
be
not
many
resource
around
about
technology_6
i
be
still
able
to
use
it
in
different
environment
without
have
a
hard
time
so
i
guess
i
will
start
use
this
technology_14
with
more
frequency
now
how
about
you
what
do
you
think
about
the
quality_attribute_10
