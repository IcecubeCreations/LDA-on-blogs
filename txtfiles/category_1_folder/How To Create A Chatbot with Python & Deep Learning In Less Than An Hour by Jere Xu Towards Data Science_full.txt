in

than
an
hourobviously
don’t
expect
it
to
be
siri
or
alexa…hopefully
one
day
bb

will
become
reality…some
people
genuinely
dislike
human
connector_1
whenever
they
be
force
to
socialize
or
go
to
that
involve
lot
of
people
they
feel
detach
and
awkward
personally
i
believe
that
i’m
most
extroverted
because
i
gain
energy
from
connector_2
with
other
people
there
be
plenty
of
people
on
this
earth
who
be
the
exact
opposite
who
connector_3
very
drain
from
social
connector_1
i’m
remind
of
a
very
unique
film
connector_4
her

the
basic
premise
of
the
film
be
that
a
man
who
suffer
from
loneliness
depression
a
boring

and
an
impend
divorce
end
up
fall
in
love
with
an
requirement_2
requirement_2
on
his
computer’s
operate
component_1
maybe
at
the
time
this
be
a
very
science
fictiony
concept
give
that
requirement_2
back
then
wasn’t
advance
enough
to
become
a
surrogate
human
but
now

thing
have
connector_5
a
lot
i
fear
that
people
will
give
up
on
find
love
or
even
social
connector_1
among
human
and
seek
it
out
in
the
digital
technology_2
don’t
believe
me
i
won’t
tell
you
what
it
mean
but
search
up
the
definition
of
the
term
waifu
and
cringe
now
isn’t
this
an
overly
verbose
introduction
to
a
quality_attribute_1
requirement_3
project
possibly
now
that
i’ve
detail
an
issue
that
have
ground
for
actual
concern
for
many
men
and
woman
in
this
world
let’s
switch
gear
and
build
something
quality_attribute_1
and
fun
here’s
what
the
finish

will
look

fork

and
clone
it
to
your

here’s
a
quick
breakdown
of

the
for
connector_7
in
the

connector_data_1
into
a

the
for
clean
up

on
the
prediction
from
the
component_5
and
create

—
the
actual
component_5
create
by
train_chatbot
py
and
use
by
chatgui
pythe
full
be
on
the
technology_4
pattern_2
but
i’m
go
to
walk
through
the
detail
of
the
for
the
sake
of
quality_attribute_2
and
quality_attribute_3
understand
now
let’s
begin
by

the
necessary
technology_5
when
you
run
the
technology_1
on
your
terminal
be
sure
to
make
sure
they
be
instal
properly
i
use
pip3
to
install
the
package
we
have
a
whole
bunch
of
technology_5
technology_9
natural
technology_6
technology_10
which
contain
a
whole
bunch
of
technology_11
for
clean
up
text
and
prepare
it
for
deep

algorithm
technology_7
which
load
technology_7
directly
into
technology_1
pickle
which
load
pickle

technology_12
which
can
perform
linear
algebra
very
efficiently
and
kera
which
be
the
deep

technology_13
we’ll
be
use
initialize
requirement_1
trainingnow
it’s
time
to
initialize
all
of
the
connector_data_4
where
we’ll
component_6
our
natural
technology_6
connector_data_1
we
have
our
technology_7
i
mention
early
which
contain
the
“intents”
here’s
a
snippet
of
what
the
technology_7
actually
look

typical
technology_7
formatwe
use
the
technology_7
to
load
in
the
and
connector_9
it
a
the
variable
intent
if
you
look
carefully
at
the
technology_7

you
can
see
that
there
be
sub
connector_data_5
within
connector_data_5
for
example
“patterns”
be
an
attribute
within
“intents”
so
we
will
use
a
nest
for
loop
to
extract
all
of
the
word
within
“patterns”
and
them
to
our
word
connector_data_2
we
then
to
our
document
connector_data_2
each
pair
of
pattern_3
within
their
correspond
tag
we
also
the
tag
into
our
connector_data_2
and
we
use
a
quality_attribute_1
conditional
statement
to
prevent
repeat
next
we
will
take
the
word
connector_data_2
and
lemmatize
and
lowercase
all
the
word
inside
in
requirement_5
you
don’t
already

lemmatize
mean
to
turn
a
word
into
it
base
mean
or
it
lemma
for
example
the
word
“walking”
“walked”
“walks”
all
have
the
same
lemma
which
be
“walk”
the
purpose
of
lemmatizing
our
word
be
to
narrow
everything
down
to
the
quality_attribute_1
level
it
can
be
it
will
connector_9
u
a
lot
of
time
and
unnecessary
error
when
we
actually
component_7
these
word
for
requirement_3
this
be
very
similar
to
stem
which
be
to
reduce
an
inflected
word
down
to
it
base
or
root
form
next
we
sort
our
connector_data_4
and
out
the
connector_data_6
alright
look
we’re
set
to
build
our
deep

component_5
build
the
deep

modellet’s
initialize
our
train
connector_data_1
with
a
variable
train
we’re
create
a
giant
nest
connector_data_2
which
contain
bag
of
word
for
each
of
our
document
we
have
a
feature
connector_4
output_row
which
simply
act
a
a
key
for
the
connector_data_2
we
then
shuffle
our
train
set
and
do
a
train
test
split
with
the
pattern_3
be
the
x
variable
and
the
intent
be
the
y
variable
now
that
we
have
our
train
and
test
connector_data_1
ready
we
will
now
use
a
deep

component_5
from
kera
connector_4
sequential
i
don’t
want
to
overwhelm
you
with
all
of
the
detail
about
how
deep

component_8
work
but
if
you
be
curious
connector_6
out
the
resource
at
the
bottom
of
the

the
sequential
component_5
in
kera
be
actually
one
of
the
quality_attribute_1
neural
requirement_4
a
multi
pattern_4
perceptron
if
you
don’t
what
that
be
i
don’t
blame
you
here’s
the
documentation
in
kera
this
particular
requirement_4
have

pattern_4
with
the
first
one
have

neuron
the
second
one
have

neuron
and
the
third
one
have
the
number
of
intent
a
the
number
of
neuron
remember
the
point
of
this
requirement_4
be
to
be
able
to
predict
which
intent
to
choose
give
some
connector_data_1
the
component_5
will
be
train
with
stochastic
gradient
descent
which
be
also
a
very
complicate
topic
stochastic
gradient
descent
be
more
quality_attribute_4
than
normal
gradient
descent
that’s
all
you
need
to

after
the
component_5
be
train
the
whole
thing
be
turn
into
a
technology_12
and
connector_9
a
chatbot_model
h5
we
will
use
this
component_5
to
form
our
requirement_1

build
requirement_1
guionce
again
we
need
to
extract
the
connector_data_7
from
our

here
be
some
that
contain
all
of
the
necessary
component_9
for
run
the
gui
and
pattern_5
them
into
unit
we
have
the
clean_up_sentence
which
clean
up
any
sentence
that
be
inputted
this
be
use
in
the
bow

which
take
the
sentence
that
be
clean
up
and
create
a
bag
of
word
that
be
use
for
predict
which
be
base
off
the
connector_data_8
we
connector_3
from
train
our
component_5
early
in
our
predict_class

we
use
an
error
threshold
of


to
avoid
too
much
overfitting
this
will
output
a
connector_data_2
of
intent
and
the
probability
their
likelihood
of
match
the
correct
intent
the
getresponse
take
the
connector_data_2
output
and
connector_10
the
technology_7
and
output
the
most
connector_8
with
the
high
probability
finally
our
chatbot_response
take
in
a
connector_data_9
which
will
be
inputted
through
our
requirement_1
gui
predict
the
with
our
predict_class

put
the
output
connector_data_2
into
getresponse
then
output
the
connector_8
what
we
connector_3
be
the
foundation
of
our
requirement_1
we
can
now
tell
the
requirement_6
something
and
it
will
then
respond
back
here
come
the
fun
part
if
the
other
part
weren’t
fun
already
we
can
create
our
gui
with
technology_14
a
technology_1
technology_5
that
allow
u
to
create
custom

we
create
a
connector_4
connector_11
which
set
up
the
basic
requirement_7
of
our
requirement_1
if
the
connector_data_9
that
we
input
into
the
requirement_1
be
not
an
empty

the
requirement_6
will
output
a
connector_8
base
on
our
chatbot_response

after
this
we
build
our
chat
window
our
scrollbar
our
for
connector_12
connector_data_9
and
our
textbox
to
create
our
connector_data_9
we
place
all
the
component_2
on
our
screen
with
quality_attribute_1
coordinate
and
height
run
chatbotfinally
it’s
time
to
run
our
requirement_1
because
i
run
my
component_10
on
a
window

component_3
i
have
to
download
a
component_11
connector_4
xming
if
you
run
your
component_10
and
it
give
you
some
weird
error
about
the
component_10
fail
you
can
download
xming
before
you
run
your
component_10
you
need
to
make
sure
you
install
technology_1
or
python3
with
pip
or
pip3
if
you
be
unfamiliar
with
command
line
command
connector_6
out
the

once
you
run
your

you
should

this
conclusioncongratulations
on
complete
this
project
build
a
quality_attribute_1
requirement_1
connector_13
you
to
a
variety
of
useful
skill
for
connector_data_1
science
and
general
programming
i
feel
that
the
best
way
for
me
at
least
to
anything
be
to
build
and
tinker
around
if
you
want
to
become
quality_attribute_3
at
something
you
need
to
connector_3
in
lot
of
practice
and
the
best
way
to
practice
be
to
connector_3
your
hand
dirty
and
build
area
of
improvementthank
you
for
take
the
time
to
connector_14
through
this

feel
free
to
connector_6
out
my
portfolio
or
my
technology_15

try
out
different
neural
networkswe
use
the
quality_attribute_1
kera
neural
requirement_4
so
there
be
a
lot
of
room
for
improvement
feel
free
to
try
out
convolutional
requirement_4
or
recurrent
requirement_4
for
your
project

use
more
dataour
technology_7
be
extremely
tiny
in
term
of
the
variety
of
possible
intent
and
connector_8
human
technology_6
be
billion
of
time
more
complex
than
this
so
create
jarvis
from
scratch
will
require
a
lot
more

use
different
frameworksthere
be
many
more
deep

technology_13
than
kera
there’s
