htmlone
of
the
many
quality_attribute_1
practice
technology_3
technology_5
impose
be
properly
modularizing
your

have
your
component_2
modularized
you
have
quite
a
few
choice
when
it
come
to
connector_1
between
those

you
can
build
your
component_3
a
“monolithfirst”
but
you
can
decide
up
front
to
choose
a
connector_1
style
which
will
not
hinder
break
them
down
into
separate
container
so
e
g
they
can
be
quality_attribute_2
in
a
cluster
with
technology_4
of

a
direct
connector_1
style
such
a
declarative
component_4
could
be
your
first
choice
but
what
if
some
of
the
be
long
run
and
therefore
an
pattern_1
connector_1
style
would
be
preferable
additionally
what
if
you
foresee
that
in
the
not
so
distant
future
you
would
to
have
the
option
to
separate
some
of
the
responsible
for
those
long
run
into
separate
container
and
quality_attribute_2
one
or
more
instance
of
each
in
technology_6
cluster
for
those
reason
i
choose
to
use
a
connector_data_1
pattern_2
to
facilitate
this
pattern_1
connector_1
and
have
the
quality_attribute_3
to
migrate
the
component_1
into
cluster
whenever
i
choose
to
do
so
because
of
my
previous
experience
with
and
it
versatility
i
choose
technology_2
in
addition
to
have
the
option
of
use
some
of
the
more
popular
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_3
without
have
to
connector_2
them
from
scratch
i
choose
technology_1
which
luckily
have
a
technology_2

i
find
very
little

no
