pattern_1
be
increasingly
use
in
the
development
world
a
developer
work
to
create
large
more
complex
component_2
that
be
quality_attribute_2
develop
and
manage
a
a
combination
of
small
component_3
that
work
cohesively
together
for
large
component_4
wide
requirement_7
technology_3
be
rise
to
meet
the
need
to
think
about
and
build
component_5
use
a
piece
by
piece
methodology
that
be
frankly
le
mind
boggle
than
consider
the
whole
of
the
component_4
at
once
today
we’ll
take
a
look
at
pattern_1
the
benefit
of
use
this
capability
and
a
few
example
which
technology_1
pattern_3
be
your
favorite
what
be
pattern_1
pattern_1
be
a
form
of
pattern_4
architecture
style
one
of
the
most
important
skill
for
technology_1
developer
wherein
component_2
be
build
a
a
collection
of
different
small
component_3
rather
than
one
whole
component_6
instead
of
a
monolithic
component_6
you
have
several
independent
component_2
that
can
run
on
their
own
and
be
create
use
different
cod
or
programming
technology_4
big
and
complicate
component_2
can
be
make
up
of
quality_attribute_3
and
independent
component_7
that
be
executable
by
themselves
these
small
component_7
be
group
together
to
connector_3
all
the
requirement_7
of
the
big
monolithic
component_6
pattern_1
capture
your
requirement_8
scenario
answer
the
question
“what
problem
be
you
try
to
solve
”
it
be
usually
develop
by
an
engineering
team
with
only
a
few
member
and
can
be
connector_4
in
any
programming
technology_4
a
well
a
utilize
any
technology_2
each
of
the
involve
component_7
be
independently
versioned
connector_5
and
quality_attribute_4
these
pattern_1
can
connector_6
with
other
pattern_1
and
can
have
unique
url
or
name
while
be
always
quality_attribute_5
and
consistent
even
when
failure
be
experience
what
be
the
benefit
of
pattern_1
there
be
several
benefit
to
use
pattern_1
for
one
because
these
small
component_2
be
not
dependent
on
the
same
cod
technology_4
the
developer
can
use
the
programming
technology_4
that
they
be
most
familiar
with
that
help
developer
come
up
with
a
component_8
fast
with
lower
cost
and
few
bug
the
agility
and
low
cost
can
also
come
from
be
able
to
quality_attribute_6
these
small
component_7
on
other
project
make
it
more
quality_attribute_7
example
of
pattern_1
technology_2
for
technology_1
there
be
several
pattern_1
technology_2
that
you
can
use
for
develop
for
technology_1
some
of
these
be
technology_5
this
be
probably
the
best
technology_1
pattern_1
technology_2
that
work
on
top
of
technology_4
for
inversion

and
others

utility
that
would
make

development
easy
the
best
thing
about
technology_6
be
that
it
have
great
documentation
that
be
fill

it
be
also
fast

have
extremely
easy
connector_14
the
documentation
on
how
to
