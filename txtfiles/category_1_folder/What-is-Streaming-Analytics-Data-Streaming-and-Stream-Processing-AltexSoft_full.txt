please
note
since
this

we
suggest
you
connector_11
the

this
explain
what

be
we’ll
take
a
look
at
connector_data_1
connector_2
real

component_1
and
the
difference
between
traditional
and
connector_1
analysis
with
real

example
of
it
it’s
essential
to
also
cover
the
benefit
of

connector_2
connector_data_1
and
the

this
type
of
requirement_1
work
mainly
with
connector_data_1
flow
without
complex
analytical
connector_data_4
the
coding_keyword_2
purpose
of
it
be
to

nevertheless
the
sphere
of
usage
can
coincide
with

to
understand
the

of

let’s
compare
it
with

when
we

requirement_9
decision
make
and
it
mainly
focus
on
historical

which
in
most
requirement_12
doesn’t
lose
it
importance
or
relevance
pattern_1
component_1
architectural
component_12
historical
connector_data_1
be
component_13
a
a
quality_attribute_5
unit
that
can
be
divide
into
piece
in
the
component_1
of
technology_12
and
warehousing
the
connector_data_1
be
move
and
component_1
by
pattern_1
a
pattern_1
have
to
be
query
by
a
component_6
or
a
component_14
so
the
component_11
would
understand
when
to
fetch
connector_data_1
and
which
piece
of
it
how
to
component_1
it
and
present
it
to
the
end
component_6
example
an
organization
connector_14
sale
connector_data_1
in
it
requirement_15
once
the
component_6
want
to
query
connector_data_1
for
analysis
he
or
she
will
pass
parameter
to
define
the
require
portion
of
the
connector_data_5
for
instance
technology_2
leather

region
northern
california
time
period
1st
quarter
of

the
component_11
would
understand
which
connector_data_1
to
fetch
from
storage
so
each
piece
of
connector_data_1
pass
the
give
parameter
would
be
a
pattern_1
connector_2
component_1
connector_1
come
up
a
a
relatively
concept
at
first
connector_1
component_1
deal
with
connector_data_1
connector_2
a
connector_data_1
connector_2
be
a
constant
flow
of
connector_data_1
which
connector_data_6
with
high
frequency
and
lose
it
relevance
in
a
short
period
of
time
for
example
these
could
be
pattern_5
connector_data_1
connector_data_5
from
iot
component_5
hardware
sensor
etc
connector_2
component_1
architectural
component_12
a
connector_data_1
connector_13
have
no
begin
or
end
they
can’t
be
break
into
pattern_1
so
there
be
no
time
when
the
connector_data_1
can
be
connector_15
into
storage
and
component_1
instead
connector_data_1
connector_13
be
component_1
on
the
fly
example
a
quality_attribute_4
organization
install
motion
sensor
and
alarm
component_10
at
component_15
house
motion
sensor
connector_10
connector_data_5
about
the
movement
every
second
and
connector_16
quality_attribute_4
alert
signal
surpass
some
threshold
the
connector_data_1
come
to
the
processor
would
then
be
divide
by
each
sensor
and
by
certain
group
of
sensor
so
to
pattern_6
the
connector_data_1
a
component_6
will
have
to
ingest
a
connector_data_1
connector_2
come
from
say
a
back
entrance
sensor
group
a
the
connector_data_1
connector_2
be
ingest
the
component_6
will
be
able
to
pattern_6
real
time
number
and
connector_17
of
a
give
group
of
sensor
so
the
component_16
component_17
in
this
requirement_12
turn
into
a
vicious
circle
because
connector_18
and
component_1
be
do
continuously
nevertheless
connector_data_1
connector_13
can
also
be
a
component_7
of
connector_data_5
to
connector_10
historical
connector_data_1
in
this
requirement_12
an
additional
requirement_15
would
component_13
this
connector_data_1
to
be
technology_13
and
further
use
in
pattern_4
connector_2
and
pattern_1
component_1
combine
into
one
analytical
component_4
now
to
carry
concurrent
component_1
of
multiple
connector_2
we
need
specific
hardware
and

connector_2
component_1
be
hold
by
component_10
connector_12
connector_2
processor
pattern_7
that
be
able
to
ingest
connector_data_1
connector_13
and
component_1
them
with
a
small
response_time
and
no
connector_data_1
loss
the
connector_data_1
can
be
generate
by
many
component_18
at
the
same
time
perhaps
from
beacon
at
a
large
mall
beacon
track
requirement_14
movement
along
the
mall
constantly
connector_8

connector_data_1
that
would
be
a

all
of
this

simultaneously
by

keep
it

and
constantly
bring
it
to
the
component_6
further
the
connector_data_1
can
be
pattern_6
a
a
real

tracker
through
an
analytical

that
will
update

that
make
connector_2

technology_10
goldengate
other
important
consideration
be
visualization
and
connector_data_1
representation
you
can
find
a
dedicate
pattern_4
technology_5
by
technology_10
but
it
doesn’t
provide
much
connector_data_5
about
requirement_17
with
the
connector_2
requirement_1
component_4
the
reason
for
that
might
be
in
a

and
analysis
connector_13
can
be
quality_attribute_12
either
on
requirement_18
a
a
part
of
requirement_18
or
on
premise
a
all
the
mention
component_25
above
also
support

instrument
what
be
the
real
world
example
of
connector_1
requirement_1
okay
we’ve
discuss
the
theoretical
part
of
how
connector_2
component_1
work
in
general
and
how
it’s
apply
to
connector_data_1
analysis
and
requirement_9
use
now
it’s
vital
to
mention
some
real
world
example
of
how
requirement_20
utilize
real
time
requirement_1
and
the
benefit
it
connector_23
uber
chaperone

technology_5
we
all
what
uber
do
an
international
ride
hail

component_9
uber
requirement_21
component_2
deal
with
two
real
time
instance
track
location
of
driver
and
component_15
require
constant
connector_data_1
flow
and
connector_data_6
of
geolocation
connector_24
this
connector_data_1
to
both
type
of
component_16
component_6
this
mean
that
uber
have
to
deal
with
petabyte
of
connector_data_8
to
keep
track
of
connector_data_1
flow
constant
financial
flow
come
from
uber
component_22
that
make
payment
directly
through
the
component_16
require
pattern_3
financial
mean
there
be
a
high
risk
of
fraud
so
in
addition
to
the
amount
of
control
connector_2
connector_data_1
uber
also
have
to
be
on
the
alert
with
fraud
detection
uber’s
chaperone
audit
connector_data_1
component_4
base
on
technology_6
technology_7
be
build
to
respond
to
these
two
issue
use
technology_7
a
it
pattern_8
component_9
uber
perform
high
quality_attribute_1
connector_data_1
loss
audit
and
duplicate
detection
perform
audit
between
multiple
connector_data_1
center
it
become
possible
for
uber
to
both
decrease
error
rat
avoid
connector_data_1
loss
and
improve
fraud
detection
netflix

netflix
deal
with
petabyte
of
real

so
keystone
be
not
the
only
connector_data_1
component_4
work
with
connector_data_1
connector_2
in
the
heart
of
it
be
technology_6
technology_7
a
a
pattern_8
component_9
allow
low
quality_attribute_13
component_1
while
flink
hold

further
the
component_4
connector_25
to
the
analytical
with
separate
technology_7
on
the

face
part
additionally
the
connector_data_1
be

component_1
use
technology_19
by

elasticsearch
mantis
another
connector_2
component_1
component_4
by

be
mantis
which
mainly
focus
on
build
a
low
quality_attribute_13
real
time
component_16
on
top
of
it
mantis
focus
on
operational
component_2
for
internal
organizational
usage
so
it
have
a
completely
different
set
of
technology_5
inside
without
dive
into
too
many
tech
detail
mantis
provide
operational
requirement_16
and
real

alert
to
work
with
connector_data_1
how
to
start
connector_2
requirement_1
by
any
mean
acquaintance
with
technology_6
technology_2
and
technology_24
would
make
it
a
lot
easy
to
connector_26
your
own
component_4
our
recommendation
in
build
a
dedicate
component_4
be
to
keep
the
focus
on
choose
a
diverse
connector_2
processor
to
pair
with
your
exist
analytical

or
keep
an
eye
on
vendor
who
offer
both
connector_2
component_1
and
pattern_4
a
a
component_9
the
best
way
to
start
with
connector_2
requirement_1
be
to
look
at
what
technology_6
offer
in
term
of
open
component_7
instrument
mainly
you
can
focus
on
technology_7
documentation
a
most
connector_data_1
component_25
and
technology_2
for
connector_1
requirement_1
be
base
on
it
both
a
a
pattern_8
component_9
and
connector_2
processor
