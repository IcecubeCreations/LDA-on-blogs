certainly
take
the

scene
by
storm
over
the

many

have
begin
transform
their
monolithic
component_3
into
a
pattern_3
base
component_4
pattern_2
be
quality_attribute_4
for
intensive
and
complicate
component_3
but
not
very
quality_attribute_4
for
small
component_3
due
to
overhead
and
over
complexity
however
it
be
important
to
that
monolithic
architecture
there
be
recurrent
problem
when

therefore
this

this
section
attempt
to
explain
a
few
common
design
that
can
be
use
to
solve
this
problem
decompose
base
on
requirement_1
capabilitiesit
be
a
quality_attribute_4
strategy
to
decompose
a
technology_3
or
into
well
define
and
separate
requirement_1
capability
and
these
capability
form
a
component_1
itself
for
instance
take
a
shop
component_4
for
instance
it
contain
perhaps
seller
capability
buyer
capability
advertising
capability
payment
capability
and
other
miscellaneous
capability
each
of
these
capability
can
form
a
specific
component_1

be
the
requirement_1
domain
or
problem
space
itself
and
it
contain
several
subdomains
that
correspond
to
a
certain
part
in
the
problem
space
there
be
several
type
of
subdomains
core
subdomains
the
key
differentiator
for
the
requirement_1

be
the

the
technology_3

they
be
the
most
valuable
part
support
subdomains
support
the
core
subdomainsgeneric
subdomains
not
a
define
part
of

component_4
an
example
would
make
it
easy
to
understand
this
decomposition
pattern_1
imagine
you
have
a
shop
that
include
inventory
requirement_3
delivery
requirement_3
order
requirement_3
online
component_5
requirement_3
each
of
this
correspond
to
a
subdomain
in
the
domain
a
specific
part
in
the
shop
hence
the
architectural
diagram
for
the
above
example
would
look
something
this
ddd

addition
each

a
it
be
difficult
to
break
the
monolithic
component_4

while
the

quality_attribute_5
hence
the
straggler
pattern_1
come
into
play
the
pattern_1
essentially
entail
incrementally
break
down
individual
component_8
or
requirement_4
into
pattern_2
and
remove
those
component_8
from
the

an

there
be
many
concern
that

how
do

component_1
how
to
handle

these
concern
can

use
an

pattern_1
an
component_12
gateway
pattern_1
can
be
pattern_4
a
a
pattern_5
or
pattern_6
that
connector_3
incoming
connector_data_2
to
it
relevant
pattern_3
the
component_12
gateway
also
act
a
an
entry
point
for
all
the
quality_attribute_7
pattern_2
and
provide
a
well
define
component_12
for
component_13
in
addition
an
component_12
gateway
can
be
use
for
pattern_7
and
traffic
control
it
can
also
be
use
to
convert
one
technology_7

component_13
connector_data_2
be
pass
through
the
gateway
where
it
pass
to
the
load
balancer
and
then
pass
to
it
respective
pattern_2
aggregator
patternthis
pattern_1
be
very
useful
when
we
desire
the
combination
of
multiple
connector_data_5

from
various
pattern_2
for
instance
let’s
say
an
order
have
be
confirm
an
order
have

pattern_2
technology_3
pattern_3
to
connector_6
technology_3
detailsmerchant
pattern_3
to
connector_6
merchant
detailspayment
make
payment
and
statusthe
ui
want
to
combine
all
this
connector_data_5
and
display
for
the
component_14
but
we
do
not
want
the
ui
or
the
client’s
end
to
handle
this
combination
of
connector_data_5
a
it
violate
the
single
responsibility
principle
srp
hence
we
can
quality_attribute_5
the
aggregator
pattern_1
that
aggregate
all
relate
microservices’
connector_data_5
and
combine
them
into
a
single
aggregate
connector_data_5
to
be

to
the
component_13
the
follow
pattern_1
can
be
do
in
the
follow
way
use
component_12
gateway
the
gateway
can
be
responsible
for
grouping
relate
connector_data_2
together
and
then
combine
the
connector_data_6
which
be
to
be
connector_7
to
the
requestor
composite
pattern_3
this
pattern_3
connector_8
connector_data_2
to
all
pattern_2
involve
payment
merchant
and
technology_3
with
respect
to
the
above
example
and
then
also
aggregate
all
the
connector_data_5
and
connector_8
complete
connector_data_5
back
to
the
requestor
component_13
side
ui
composition
patternwith
respect
to
ui
how
do
we
connector_data_4
multiple
pattern_2
while
display
all
the
relevant
connector_data_5
for
the
component_14
in
monolithic
component_4
one
component_12
connector_data_3
will
be
enough
to
gather
all
the
connector_data_5
need
but
this
no
long
work
with
pattern_3
architecture
the
idea
of
this
pattern_1
be
to
separate
the
ui
into
specific
region
that
be
handle
by
one
or
more
component_10
each
component_10
be
responsible
for
make
the
connector_data_4
to
the
correct
pattern_3
to
connector_9
the
right
connector_data_5
to
display
for
the
component_14
this
can
be
do
easily
use
technology_8
or
technology_9
in
addition
connector_10
or
connector_data_7
in
a
specific
connector_data_5
will
cause
that
specific
region
to
be
re
render
instead
of
the
whole
component_15
chain
pattern_3
patternvisual
representation
of
chain
pattern_3
patternthis
pattern_1
involve
chain
multiple
pattern_2
in
a
chain
and
go
through
them
one
at
a
time
synchronously
imagine
the
above
example
involve
order
where
we
need
to
use
merchant
technology_3
and
payment
pattern_2
in
this
pattern_1
each
pattern_3
will
be
use
one
at
a
time
so
suppose
a
component_13
connector_11
an
order
connector_data_4
what
happen
be
that
it
connector_data_2
the
merchant
component_1
first
then
once
the
merchant
component_1
be
do
it
will
then
connector_data_4
technology_3
component_1
and
then
finally
payment
component_1
essentially
it
be
a
step
by
step
component_9
then
the
aggregate
connector_12
will
be
direct
back
to
the
component_13
however
it
be
important
to
take
note
that
the
whole
component_9
be
pattern_8
so
technology_3
component_1
will
not
be
use
until
merchant
component_1
be
do
and
the
component_13
will
be
block
till
the
aggregate
connector_12
be
connector_13
so
do
not
have
too
long
of
a
chain
if
not
the
component_13
will
be
block
for
a
long
period
of
time
component_16
patternevery
pattern_3
need
to
deal
with
a
specific
component_16
therefore
this
section
explain
the
possible
component_16
pattern_1
that
can
be
use
for
a
pattern_3
architecture
component_16
for
every
microservicethis
pattern_1
also
formerly

a
component_16
per
component_1
tackle
these
follow
set
of
problem
connector_data_5
be
replicate
or
inconsistenteach
component_1
must
be
quality_attribute_8
independently
of
other
serviceseach
component_1
have
it
own
component_16
requirement
for
it
to
properlyessentially
we
can
have
a
separate
component_16
for
each
component_1
and
the
component_16
can
only
be
connector_14
by
it
associate
component_1
only
and
this
can
be
do
through
component_16

in
this
way
each
component_16
be
quality_attribute_9
for
the
current
pattern_2
itself
reduce
pattern_9
and
inconsistency
in
addition
it
tackle
the
other
two
problem
a
the
component_16
can
be
modify
to
fit
it
quality_attribute_10
or
it
requirement
connector_15
databaseshared
databasethis
pattern_1
be
more
suitable
for
greenfield
project
that
have
a
monolithic
architecture
it
be
difficult
to
completely
de
normalize
all
the
connector_data_5
quality_attribute_7
we
can
quality_attribute_5
the
connector_16
component_16
pattern_1
where
several
pattern_2
be
use
one
particular
component_16
however
do
take
note
that
it
be
best
to
have

to

pattern_2
use
one
component_16
a
if
we
have
too
many
pattern_2
quality_attribute_11
on
a
single
component_16
quality_attribute_10
individual
pattern_2
will
be
a
problem
see
above
pattern_1
cqrsyou
be
familiar
with
this
pattern_1
it’s
connector_17
command
query
responsibility
segregation
cqrs
there
be
a
problem
with
regard
to
component_16
per
component_1
what
if
the
component_4
require
a
query
that
involve
multiple
separate
component_17
this
would
not
be
possible
at
all
a
all
the
component_18
be
keep
private
to
one
component_1
only
to
tackle
this
we
can
use
cqrs
pattern_1
we
can
split
the
architecture
into
command
and
query
command
such
a
connector_18
delete
and
update
can
be
handle
by
individual
component_16
or
component_1
connector_19
eg
connector_20
connector_data_5
will
instead
use
materialize
pattern_4
a
a
datasource
in
fact
this
pattern_1
be
commonly
connector_21
with
the
component_19
design
pattern_1
miscellaneous
patternsthis
section
contain
pattern_1
that
be

take
a

patternthis
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
current
circuit
breaker
p
let’s
assume
this
situation
imagine
one
of
the
component_8
be
down
then
the
component_13
will
keep
try
to
connector_data_4
from
that
component_1
a
it
do
not
have
any
connector_data_8
regard
the
current
state
of
that
component_1
instance
this
waste
requirement_6
resource
and
time
to
prevent
such
a
thing
we
can
use
a

resizer

be
down
so
if
the
number
of
fail
connector_data_2
for
that
component_8
reach
a
threshold
let’s
say

then
the
circuit
breaker
will
“trip”
in
this
requirement_7
all
connector_data_2
to
resizer

will
automatically
fail
and
will
not
be
connector_7
out
at
all
so
for
a
period
of
time
all
connector_data_2
for
resizer

will
not
be
component_9
and
will
warrant
an
automatic
failure
this
connector_22
on

blue

deploymentimagine
that
a
component_1
be
be
upgrade
and
develop
the
act
of
stop
the
component_4
to
quality_attribute_6
this
upgrade
component_1
not
be
a
very
wise
choice
a
it
introduce
a
long
downtime
and
component_14
annoyance
even
so
if
the
upgrade
component_1
crash
or
a
bug
have
be
find
go
back
to
the
old
one
will
cause
more
downtime
hence
in
this
requirement_7
we
use
blue
green
deployment
let’s
take
a
look
at
the
image
below

a
clear
explanation

to
be
the

in
the
meantime
the
blue
environment
component_20
the
upgrade
component_1
be
quality_attribute_6
and
can
be
test
once
satisfy
we
can
connector_23
the
pattern_6
to
now
connector_4
all
component_14
connector_data_2
to
the
blue
environment
instead
this
greatly
reduce
downtime
in
addition
if
we
need
to
rollback
due
to
major
bug
simply
redirect
component_21
back
to
the
green
environment
a
great
way
to
ensure
constant
low
downtime
conclusionwith
the
increasing
popularity
of
pattern_2
understand
such
pattern_1
and
design
principle
be
important
in
develop
a
quality_attribute_12
quality_attribute_13
and
quality_attribute_14
