about
three
technology_3
that
take
different
approach
to
infrastructure
connector_data_4
analysis
and
requirement_8
when
look
around
the
connector_data_4
center
it’s
difficult
to
ignore
the
potential
in
all
of
the
requirement_1
quality_attribute_4
from
infrastructure
component_3
there
be
component_1
and
component_4
requirement_2
connector_data_4
from
requirement_9
and
storage
tap
and
metadata
from
component_5
and
component_4
in
addition
to
the
component_1
and
storage
infrastructure
there’s
connector_data_4
from
requirement_9
component_6
which
include
quality_attribute_2
component_6
requirement_2
and
pattern_1
and
switch
connector_data_4
in
theory
all
of
this
connector_data_4
could
be
use
to
identify
trend
to
predict
or
even
prevent
component_7
outage
at
the
very
minimum
this
connector_data_4
could
be
use
to
correlate
and
identify
component_8
of
component_4
issue
i’ll
look
at
three
technology_3
that
take
different
approach
to
infrastructure
connector_data_4
analysis
splunk
splunk
be
a
long
time
requirement_10
player
in
infrastructure
connector_data_4
analysis
it
have
traditionally
be
consider
a
requirement_2
collector
or
aggregation
technology_1
but
it
have
mature
into
a
pseudo
requirement_1
analysis
technology_1
splunk
have
expand
it
use
requirement_11
to
include
analysis
of
all
kind
of
connector_data_4
include
baseball
requirement_12
when
it
come
to
infrastructure
connector_data_4
splunk
aggregate
and
nom
connector_data_4
for
diverse
component_9
since
splunk
be
look
to
diversify
beyond
an
infrastructure
requirement_8
technology_1
splunk
doesn’t
limit
the
connector_data_4
component_8
