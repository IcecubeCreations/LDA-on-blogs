the

if
they

be
still

widely
use
pattern_4
to
move
connector_data_2
between
different

via
pattern_5

due
to
it
challenge
in
today’s
world
where
real

esb
be
use
in

be
often
a

architecture
for
correlation
of
different
to
connector_6
contextual
rule
and
stateful
requirement_8
use
all
these
component_12
introduce
challenge
and
complexity
in
development
and
technology_1
technology_2
an
open_source
connector_1
component_2
this
component_13
discus
how
team
in
different
requirement_9
solve
these
challenge
by
build
a
requirement_10
connector_1
component_2
from
the
grind
up
instead
of
use
technology_4
and
esb
technology_6
in
their
architecture
this
allow
u
to
build
and
quality_attribute_2
independent
mission
critical
connector_5
real
time
component_9
and
pattern_2
the
architecture
leverage
quality_attribute_3
component_8
and
fault
tolerance
with
fast
failover
no
downtime
roll
deployment
and
the
ability
to
reprocess
so
you
can
recalculate
output
when
your
connector_7
requirement_1
and
connector_5
component_8
be
still
key
requirement_11
but
can
be
realize
in
real
time
natively
instead
of
use
additional
technology_4
esb
or
connector_5
component_8
technology_6
a
concrete
example
architecture
show
how
to
build
a
complete
connector_1
component_2
leverage
the
widely
adopt
open
component_14
technology_11
technology_1
technology_2
to
build
a
mission
critical
quality_attribute_4
highly
performant
connector_1
component_2
connector_data_1
requirement_1
and
connector_5
component_8
be
all
build
on
top
of
the
same
strong
foundation
of
technology_2
quality_attribute_2
on
