in
this
i’ll
explain
the
step
to
create
a
requirement_1
requirement_2
in
connector_data_1
studio
this
will
display
the
requirement_3
of
connector_1
in
requirement_4
i’ve
create
one
below
but
you
can
customize
the
various
requirement_1
show
to
what
interest
you
create
a
with
requirement_4
connector_2
requirement_3
the
first
step
be
to
use
one
of
the
finance
formula
to
connector_3
connector_2
requirement_3
for
example
the
formula
below
allow
u
to
connector_3
connector_2
requirement_3
for
today
and
a
previous
point
in
time
=googlefinance
ticker
attribute
start_date
end_date|num_days
interval
for
example
the
formula
below
connector_4
the
requirement_3
for
for
today
and
the
previous
day
=googlefinance
“goog”
”price”
today
today
if
we
place
this
in
the
top
leave
cell
of
a
spreadsheet
we
connector_3
a
connector_data_2
of
all
the
date
and
connector_2
requirement_3
we
can
do
this
for
a
range
of
different
requirement_1
so
we
can
have
multiple
different
connector_2
requirement_3
in
this
example
i
decide
to
connector_3
the
connector_2
requirement_3
for
the
follow
requirement_4
and
place
them
in
a
separate
within
one
spreadsheet
now
we
have
our
different
connector_2
requirement_3
and
we
can
start
think
about
create
a
connector_data_1
studio
report
with
them
however
we
first
need
to
place
them
into
a
separate
spreadsheet
in
order
for
the
connector_data_1
to
be
connector_5
in
correctly
to
connector_data_1
studio
from
create
a
second
to
act
a
a
connector_data_1
component_1
much
the
previous
how
to
create
a
five
year
currency
exchange
rate
report
in
connector_data_1
studio
we
need
to
create
a
second
with
our
connector_data_1
so
that
it
connector_6
correctly
for
connector_data_1
studio
the
reason
for
this
be
that
i
encounter
issue
connector_7
connector_data_1
from
the
original
to
connector_data_1
studio
i’m
not
entirely
sure
what
the
problem
be
be
but
i
find
create
a
second
solve
it
you
might
not
have
this
issue
to
do
this
we
need
to
use
the
importrange
=importrange
spreadsheet_url
range_string
we
can
then
the
connector_data_1
from
our
combine
connector_data_1
into
a
spreadsheet
this
will
be
the
connector_data_1
component_1
for
connector_data_1
studio
create
the
connector_data_1
studio
report
in
the
connector_data_1
from
our
second
into
connector_data_1
studio
we
can
connector_8
the
type
to
currency
usd
from
there
you
can
do
what
you
want
with
the
connector_data_1
studio
in
this
example
report
i’ve
use
scorecard
time
series
requirement_5
to
show
the
connector_data_1
the
requirement_5
below
show
the
requirement_1
over
time
the
connector_data_1
be
set
up
this
to
connector_3
around
the
issue
that
some
day
for
example
saturday
and
sunday
have
no
requirement_6
you
need
to
connector_8
one
of
the
time
series
set
to
‘linear
interpolation’
you
can
find
this
set
in
the
style
tab
of
the
line
requirement_5
i’ve
also
setup
various
scorecard
for
the
different
requirement_1
and
the
requirement_4
logo
because
i’ve
set
the
report
up
to
show
the
close
requirement_3
of
the
previous
day
it’s
possible
that
sometimes
these
scorecard
show
“no
data”
there
be
a
lot
of
different
way
to
use
the
finance
so
spend
time
play
around
and
experiment
you
can
customize
them
for
your
own
requirement_1
requirement_2
if
that’s
something
you’d
want
to
make
download
connector_data_1
studio
template
if
you’d
to
download
one
of
my
connector_data_1
studio
report
a
a
template
to
use
for
your
own
connector_data_1
you
can
visit
connector_data_1
studio
template
and
purchase
one
my
other
if
you
this
you
might
my
other
or
you
can
follow
me
on
twitter
lee
dec
in
step
toward
the
botton
where
be
you
show
all
requirement_1
on
to
one
how
do
you
connector_3
the
date
to
update
so
the
connector_data_1
stay
relevant
this
be
pretty
confuse
and
the
vlookup
will
not
work
unless
you
update
the
date
into
the
combine
thank
you
for
connector_2
connector_data_3
michael
dec
the
formula
always
display
connector_data_1
for
the
previous
year
so
it
be
always
up
to
date
=googlefinance
“goog”
”price”
today
today
connector_data_3
nk
jun
since
googlefinance
component_2
generate
requirement_3
of
weekday
there
be
no
connector_data_1
of
weekend
in
step
when
i
generate
time
series
graph
with
the
connector_data_1
the
graph
show
that
the
requirement_3
in
weekend
a
$0
how
do
you
handle
this
and
why
do
we
need
to
create
a
second
why
not
use
the
original
also
it
will
be
very
helpful
that
you
connector_2
the
example
connector_9
of
and
connector_data_1
studio
connector_data_3
michael
jun
hi
nk
thanks
for
raise
these
question
i’ve
update
the
to
connector_3
around
the
issue
that
some
day
for
example
saturday
and
sunday
have
no
requirement_6
you
need
to
connector_8
one
of
the
time
series
set
to
‘linear
interpolation’
you
can
find
this
set
in
the
style
tab
of
the
line
requirement_5
so
if
i
remember
correctly
there
be
an
issue
connector_7
connector_data_1
from
the
first
it
simply
do
not
appear
in
connector_data_1
studio
when
i
try
it
use
the
importrange
and
copy
the
connector_data_1
into
a
second
and
then
connector_10
the
second
to
connector_data_1
studio
solve
the
issue
for
me
i
don’t
think
i’m
able
to
connector_2
the
connector_9
to
the
but
be
you
not
able
to
re
create
it
use
the
connector_data_4
i
have
provide
connector_data_3
chris
sep
hi
thanks
so
much
for
this
i’m
try
to
do
something
similar
to
you
i’m
unfamiliar
with
the
studio
but
i’ll
look
into
it
look
interest
i
have
be
use
my
problem
is…i
can
do
the
historical
information…that’s
easy
enough
but
i’d
to
try
and
connector_3
real
time
connector_data_1
plot
on
a
requirement_5
the
googlefinance
have
real
time
connector_data_1
but
i
cannot
figure
out
how
to
freeze
the
connector_data_1
once
it
have
be
display
the
googlefinance
connector_data_5
every
few
minute
or
so
since
it
be
a
volatile
it
connector_data_5
to
the
current
time
and
the
previous
requirement_6
be
lose
forever
be
there
a
way
you
can
think
of
to
connector_11
the
connector_data_1
so
that
it
doesn’t
disappear
this
way
it
could
be
plot
in
a
daily
chart…
connector_data_3
michael
sep
hi
i’m
not
too
familiar
with
the
detail
of
finance
in
hope
you
manage
to
figure
it
out
connector_data_3
noobinvester
jan
you
cannot
create
a
real
time
requirement_2
a
the
number
be
delay
by
minute
connector_12
the
help
center
component_3
under
attribute
–
“price”
–
real
time
requirement_3
quote
delay
by
up
to
minute

ann
sep
thanks
for
the
i’m
go
to
dig
further
into
it
but
i’m
wonder
if
it’s
possible
to
any
pattern_1
connector_data_1
studio
to
only
show
certain
requirement_4
i’d
to
see
how
my
portfolio
be
fair
over
time
but
say
i
want
to
see
a
category
“online
service”
which
would
only
show
me
and
twitter
in
the
graph
be
that
possible
i’ve
be
try
to
find
guide
on
this
but
haven’t
connector_3
very
far
connector_data_3
michael
sep
sure
–
you
could
in
a
pattern_1
to
pattern_1
only
specific
requirement_4
or
switch
between
requirement_4
connector_data_3
mike
oct
when
i
try
to
the
connector_data_1
the
only
dimension
it
be
give
me
be
‘record
count’
have
you
encounter
this
error
connector_data_3
michael
oct
do
you
mean
the
‘metric’
be
component_4
count
maybe
you
need
to
switch
the
requirement_1
requirement_6
from
