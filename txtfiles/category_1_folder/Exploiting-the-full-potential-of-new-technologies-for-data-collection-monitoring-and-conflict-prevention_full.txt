to

to

do
so
require
the

the

have
become
increasingly
digital
with

have
now
pervade

give

why

technology_1
play
a
key

in

such

there
be
several
useful
connector_data_1
collection
now
quality_attribute_2
to
practitioner
requirement_1
connector_data_1
collection
be
the
use

such
a

for

directly
obtain
from

component_4
who
volunteer
their
own
connector_data_1
crowdsourcing
or
from

in

the
most
well
example
of
crowdsourcing
be
ushahidi
an

these

to
determine
how

some
key

there
a

what

iv
what
technology_3
be

to
connector_3
the

and
what
be
the

how
can
we
realize
the
full
potential
of
technology_1
technology_1
have
a
huge
potential
that
have
yet
to
be
fully
explore
some
researcher
even
talk
of
“big_data

”
which
allude
to
“the
full

effort
”
in
recent
year
technology_1
have
play
an
increasing
role
in

but
be
not
yet
harness
to
it
full
and
promise
potential
connector_data_2
and
connector_6
technology_1
ict
and
the
connector_data_1
they
generate
can
support
effort
to
prevent
crisis
and
tackle
cause
of

ict
can
help
researcher
connector_4
quantitative
and
qualitative
connector_data_1
more
frequently
in
insecure
or
remote
area
through
the
use
of
digital
survey
sm
administer
pattern_3
geo
spatial
connector_data_3
photograph
video
and
satellite
imagery
these
connector_data_1
provide
key
connector_data_2
about
the
driver
and
warn
sign
of
violence
to
support
conflict
prevention
approach
how
can
requirement_3
prevent
conflict
by
provide
valuable
connector_data_2
about
individual
and
in
areas—even
remote
ones—where
connector_data_1
be
often
unavailable
in
near
real
time
with
a
quality_attribute_1
level
of
quality_attribute_4
if
we
assume
that
individual
and
connector_7
their
behavior
when
violent
occur
then
requirement_3
can
capture
these
connector_7
for
example
satellite
imagery
can
be
use
to
detect
mass
movement
an
analysis
of
tweet
can
help
detect
grow
tension
frustration
and
connector_data_4
for
violence
for
instance
before
the
presidential
election
in
kenya
a
search
for
hate
speech
be
conduct
in
social
to
identify
early
sign
of
violence
concrete
example
real

in

undertake

in

because
of
all
the

people
respond

this
