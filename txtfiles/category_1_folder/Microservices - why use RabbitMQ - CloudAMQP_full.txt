developer
today
choose
to
build
component_1
with
a
pattern_2
architecture
a
oppose
to
a
monolithic
component_2
to
understand
why
this
be
the
requirement_2
we
need
to
take
a
close
look
into
connector_data_1
component_3
and
the
benefit
of
use
e
g
technology_1
a
a
connector_data_1
pattern_3
in
a
pattern_2
architecture
this
will
dive
into
the
correlation
between
a
pattern_2
component_2
and
connector_data_1
component_3
usage
to
answer
the
question
why
should
i
use
technology_1
in
a
pattern_2
architecture
go
from
monolith
to
pattern_1
you
probably
have
a
quality_attribute_1
idea
of
the
difference
between
these
two
type
of
component_2
architecture
but
a
a
reminder
letâ€™s
look
at
the
difference
monolithic
architecture
be
often
large
complex
and
tightly
couple
with
the
entire
requirement_3
contain
in
a
single
component_2
this
kind
of
architecture
come
with
several
downside
the
first
of
which
be
that
it
be
difficult
to
maintain
make
small
connector_2
to
a
monolith
architecture
affect
the
whole
component_2
which
can
cause
a
range
of
issue
go
for
a
pattern_2
architecture
instead
solve
this
by
separate
requirement_3
into
standalone
component_4
which
make
it
easy
to
connector_3
or
remove
requirement_3
without
affect
other
part
of
the
architecture
for
example
if
an
online
shop
component_5
suddenly
fail
to
connector_4
out
receipt
via
maybe
the
component_6
responsible
for
this
connector_data_2
crash
then
it
will
not
cause
trouble
in
other
part
of
the
component_2
connector_data_2
connector_data_1
connector_5
to
the
pattern_2
connector_4
receipt
will
simply
be
put
on
the
component_3
until
the
pattern_2
be
back
online
and
the
rest
of
the
component_5
can
continue
operate
a
usual
the
entire
time
watch
this
to
more
video
pattern_1
and
connector_data_1
component_7
explain
what
be
the
benefit
of
pattern_1
a
pattern_1
architecture
make
it
easy
for
requirement_4
to
quality_attribute_2
and
maintain
their
component_8
development
test
and
connector_data_3
of
individual
part
can
be
do
continuously
and
separatly
a
pattern_2
architecture
be
attractive
to
many
different
requirement_5
and
organization
since
it
allow
for
a
more
agile
approach
to
development
and
quality_attribute_3
what
be
a
pattern_2
an
individual
pattern_2
be
a
component_9
that
usually
exist
only
for
a
single
purpose
be
self
contain
and
independent
of
other
instance
and
component_9
when
build
an
component_8
in
a
pattern_2
architectural
style
the
approach
be
to
develop
a
single
component_8
consist
of
two
or
more
small
component_10
pattern_1
each
pattern_2
be
develop
separately
and
the
finish
component_8
be
the
sum
of
all
the
pattern_1
how
be
pattern_1
connector_6
pattern_1
or
be
decouple
from
each
other
but
still
able
to
connector_7
cross
connector_8
be
typical
for
a
pattern_2
architecture
mean
no
single
component_9
can
perform
without
connector_9
help
from
other
component_9
there
be
different
way
to
interconnect
pattern_1
such
a
pattern_3
eg
technology_1
remote
prodecure
connector_data_4
pattern_4
pattern_5
apis
connector_10
on
a
we
dive
deep
into
pattern_3
connector_data_1
component_3
and
technology_1
a
an
option
for
your
pattern_2
component_8
what
be
connector_data_1
component_3
the
use
of
connector_data_1
component_7
provide
a
way
for
part
of
the
component_8
to
connector_11
connector_data_5
to
a
component_3
asynchronously
and
ensure
they
be
connector_12
to
the
correct
destination
to
connector_13
connector_data_1
component_3
a
connector_data_1
pattern_3
technology_1
be
a
quality_attribute_1
option
the
connector_data_1
pattern_3
provide
temporary
connector_data_1
storage
when
the
connector_14
component_9
be
busy
or
disconnect
handle
connector_15
with
pattern_3
a
connector_data_1
pattern_3
act
a
a
middleman
for
the
pattern_1
connector_14
connector_data_5
from
one
component_8
component_11
and
hand
them
over
to
others
component_12
to
do
the
for
example
with
technology_1
connector_data_1
pattern_3
connector_data_5
be
not
publish
directly
to
a
component_3
instead
the
component_11
connector_16
a
connector_data_1
to
an
exchange
the
of
an
exchange
be
to
connector_17
connector_data_5
from
the
component_11
component_1
and
connector_18
them
to
the
correct
connector_data_1
component_3
the
connector_data_5
stay
in
the
component_3
until
the
component_12
handle
them
and
remove
them
there
be
a
couple
of
different
connector_data_1
pattern_3
to
choose
from
when
choose
between
pattern_3
you
should
try
to
nail
down
your
requirement
technology_1
and
technology_3
technology_4
be
two
open
component_13
connector_data_1
pattern_3
and
you
can
connector_10
about
the
difference
between
them
in
this
comparison
when
to
use
technology_1
or
technology_3
technology_4
technology_1
a
the
pattern_3
in
a
pattern_1
architecture
technology_1
enable
pattern_6
component_6
mean
that
it
allow
you
to
put
a
connector_data_1
in
a
component_3
without
component_6
it
immediately
technology_1
be
therefore
ideal
for
long
run
connector_data_6
or
pattern_7
connector_data_2
allow
web
component_14
to
respond
quickly
to
connector_data_7
instead
of
be
force
to
perform
computationally
intensive
connector_data_6
on
the
spot
technology_1
simply
connector_19
connector_data_5
and
pass
them
to
component_15
when
ready
technology_1
be
a
quality_attribute_4
open_source
connector_data_1
pattern_3
it
have
be
on
the
requirement_6
since
and
become
a
part
of
pivotal
it
s
continuously
update
and
improve
upon
technology_1
have
a
strong
and
highly
active
core
team
that
produce
additional
feature
improvement
and
handy
plugins
the
license
of
technology_1
have
never
connector_3
nov
technology_1
support
several
standardize
technology_5
such
a
technology_6
technology_7
stomp
etc
where
it
natively
connector_20
technology_8
the
ability
of
technology_1
to
support
different
standardize
connector_data_1
technology_5
mean
that
it
can
be
use
in
many
different
scenario
and
it
allow
you
to
replace
your
technology_1
pattern_3
with
any
technology_8
base
pattern_3
technology_1
be
use
by
a
large
number
of
requirement_7
within
various
requirement_5
and
be
use
and
trust
by
large
requirement_7
zalando
wework
wunderlist
bloomberg
and
more
all
rely
on
a
pattern_2
base
architecture
technology_1
be
component_16
friendly
and
by
follow
these
technology_1
best
practice
it
be
easy
to
tweak
the
configuration
to
suit
the
intend
purpose
technology_1
be
connector_21
in
technology_9
and
be
the
worldâ€™s
most
quality_attribute_5
open
component_13
connector_data_1
pattern_3
mean
that
itâ€™s
a
well
test
quality_attribute_6
pattern_3
the
technology_1
pattern_3
be
quality_attribute_7
and
quality_attribute_8
your
team
only
need
to
maintain
the
component_17
and
the
component_15
connector_22
and
connector_23
connector_data_5
to
from
the
component_3
under
heavy
load
if
the
component_3
grow
large
the
technology_10
reaction
be
to
more
component_15
and
parallelize
the
work
this
be
a
quality_attribute_9
and
quality_attribute_10
of
quality_attribute_2
quality_attribute_11
with
technology_1
if
connector_data_5
be
be
connector_12
to
the
component_3
at
a
fast
pace
than
the
component_15
can
handle
them
the
component_3
will
continue
to
grow
fortunately
quality_attribute_11
can
be
do
in
two
way
you
can
easily
or
remove
component_12
you
can
also
allow
the
pattern_3
to
quality_attribute_2
more
resource
through
cpu
disk
memory
to
be
able
to
handle
more
connector_data_5
in
the
component_3
but
remember
that
technology_1
work
fast
with
short
component_3
summary
so
why
use
technology_1
if
youâ€™re
look
for
a
versatile
and
quality_attribute_4
connector_data_1
pattern_3
technology_1
be
a
quality_attribute_1
option
the
technology_1
be
strong
and
grow
and
