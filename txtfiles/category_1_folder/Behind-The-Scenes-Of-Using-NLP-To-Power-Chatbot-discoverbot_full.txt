chatbots
have
the
ability
to
fulfill
any
user’s
wish—a
realistic
wish
of
whether
it’s
make
an
online
purchase
or
connector_2
a
weather
update
chatbots
have
it
all
there
be
a
reason
chatbots
be
among
the
lead

component_3
chatbots
be
essential
technology_2
use
to
connector_3
with
human
to
perform
connector_data_2
but
how
do
a
requirement_1
pattern_1
the
human
technology_1
to
it
own
and
how
do
it
understand
the
connector_data_1
and
perform
the
connector_data_2
require
by
the
component_4
the
answer
to
these
question
be
natural
technology_1
component_1
nlp
about
natural
technology_1
processingnlp
be
a
form
of
requirement_4
requirement_4
that
allow
chatbots
to
understand
and
respond
to
the
user’s
connector_data_1
requirement_4
be
the
science
of
make
component_5
and
component_6
do
connector_data_3
that
require
human
intelligence
so
nlp
essentially
fall
into
the
ocean
of
requirement_4
and
play
a
super
important
role
when
it
come
to
build
chatbots
without
nlp
chatbots
wouldn’t
be
able
to
differentiate
between
certain
phrase
for
example
we
need
nlp
to
help
give
component_7
to
the
requirement_1
so
that
it
understand
the
difference
between
“hi”
and
“see
ya
”how
do
nlp
work
in
a
requirement_1
in
order
for
the
requirement_1
to
understand
the
user’s
connector_data_1
it
need
to
somehow
convert
the
pattern_2
human
technology_1
to
pattern_3
connector_data_4
that
component_6
can
interpret
when
a
component_4
connector_4
a
connector_data_1
to
the
requirement_1
it
need
to
use
algorithm
to
connector_1
mean
and
component_7
from
every
sentence
to
connector_5
connector_data_4
from
them
this
component_1
be
connector_6
natural
technology_1
understand
nlu
and
it’s
a
subset
of
natural
technology_1
component_1
it
consist
of
interpret
the
user’s
connector_data_1
by
extract
important
and
relevant
detail
from
it
a
way
to
extract
the
essential
part
of
a
sentence
be
to
differentiate
between
the
component_2
and
the
intent
an
intent
of
a
sentence
be
the
goal
of
the
statement
what
do
the
component_4
actually
want
to
achieve
for
instance
if
the
connector_data_1
be
“when
do
the
chipotle
at
24th
street
close
”
the
intent
of
the
connector_data_1
be
to
when
the
restaurant
close
an
component_8
of
a
sentence
be
something
that
modify
or
support
the
intent
for
instance
the
component_2
of
the
question
“what
be
your
close
hour
on
tuesday
”
be
tuesday
and
close
hour
an
component_8
be
basically
anything
that
can
be
name
place
person
name
or
connector_data_5
the
requirement_1
basically
need
to
recognize
the
component_2
and
intent
of
the
user’s
connector_data_1
in
order
to
do
that
we
need
to
build
an
nlp
component_9
for
every
component_8
for
an
intent
for
example
we
can
build
an
nlp
intent
component_9
for
the
requirement_1
to
recognize
when
a
component_4
want
to
the
opening
hour
of
a
place
we
can
build
an
nlp
component_8
component_9
for
the
requirement_1
to
recognize
location
and
direction
we
can
then
use
these
nlp
component_10
for
the
requirement_1
to
offer
the
opening
hour
of
any
place
base
on
the
user’s
location
the
nlp
component_1
be
a
core
part
of
the
requirement_1
architecture
and
component_1
since
it
be
the
foundation
for
pattern_1
the
natural
human
technology_1
to
pattern_3
connector_data_4
the
requirement_1
component_1
break
down
this
way
let’s
say
you
want
to
purchase
something
and
you
decide
to
use
the
help
of
a
requirement_1
you
type
in
your
connector_data_6
when
you
connector_7
a
connector_data_1
to
the
requirement_1
ask
to
purchase
something
the
requirement_1
connector_4
the
plain
text
to
the
nlp
component_11
the
nlp
component_11
which
u
natural
technology_1
component_1
and
nlu
convert
the
text
connector_data_1
into
pattern_3
connector_data_4
for
itself
this
be
where
the
different
nlp
component_10
come
into
play
for
extract
the
intent
and
component_2
of
the
connector_data_1
the
requirement_1
move
the
connector_data_4
that
be
connector_5
the
intent
and
component_8
to
the
decision
make
component_11
the
decision
make
component_9
derive
a
solid
decision
base
on
previous
action
and
connector_data_7
take
it
make
a
connector_data_8
to
the
component_12
to
make
a
decision
this
be
where
the
requirement_1
convert
the
decision
connector_data_4
to
text
natural
technology_1
generation
nlg
consist
of
convert
connector_data_4
into
plain
text
use
nlg
the
connector_data_1
generator
output
the
connector_data_1
this
connector_data_1
be
present
to
the
component_4
in
the
form
of
a
text
connector_data_1
or
voice
this
be
where
the
requirement_1
convert
the
decision
connector_data_4
to
text
natural
technology_1
generation
nlg
consist
of
convert
connector_data_4
into
plain
text
use
nlg
the
connector_data_1
generator
output
the
connector_data_1
this
connector_data_1
be
present
to
the
component_4
in
the
form
of
a
text
connector_data_1
or
voice
lex
and
nlpamazon
alexa
be
a
great
example
of
how
nlp
be
use
to
fee
in
the
user’s
connector_data_1
and
to
output
the
decision
connector_data_1
alexa
be
powered
by
lex
which
be
an
amaze
resource
to
connector_8
deep
technology_2
such
a
automatic

asr
and
conversational
component_13
through

one

offer
by
lex
be
it
nlu
component_14
which
extract
the
intent
of
the
user’s
connector_data_1
and
connector_9
an
appropriate
and
quality_attribute_1
connector_10
conclusionnatural
technology_1
component_1
hold
great
significance
when
it
come
to
build
chatbots
nlp
be
the
technology_2
use
for
the
requirement_1
to
interpret
the
user’s
intent
properly
and
accurately
how
requirement_4
be
an
broad
and
enormous
natural
technology_1
component_1
be
also
essentially
an
ocean
of
different
algorithm
use
to
convert
text
to
important
connector_data_4
for
the
requirement_1
to
use
so
the
next
time
you
use
a
requirement_1
think
about
how
nlp
give
it
the
power
to
