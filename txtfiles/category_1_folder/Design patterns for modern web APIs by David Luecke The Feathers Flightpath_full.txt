pattern_1
for
modern
web
apisfor
the
past
decade
much
of
my
professional
life
have
quality_attribute_1
around
make
component_2
and
web
component_3
talk
to
each
other
after
make
several
contribution
to
one
of
the
first
component_4
side
technology_1
technology_2
in

i
become
inspire
by
the
idea
of
small
connector_data_1
drive
web
apis
three
year
late
i
have
the
opportunity
to
research
and
connector_1
a
project
that
allow
to
make
an
component_5
quality_attribute_2
through
different
remote
connector_data_2
pattern_2
technology_3
a
my
university
final
thesis
since
then
i
have
the
chance
to
use
and
refine
many
of
the
pattern_1
i
research
during
that
time
in
many
different
environment
from
private
project
over
startup
to
some
of
the
big
technology_4
requirement_1
in
the
world
and
in
many
different
programming
technology_5
from
technology_6
and
technology_7
over
technology_8
and
technology_9
to
nodejs
where
feather
be
the
late
distillation
of
this
journey

important
than
the
choice
of
programming
technology_5
or
technology_2
however
be
the
design
pattern_1
that
we
can
use
to
help
u
create

design
pattern_1
be
formalize
best
practice
that
the
programmer
can
use
to
solve
common
problem
when
design
an
component_5
or
component_6
in
this

i’d
to
look
at
a
combination
of
high
level
design
and
architectural
pattern_1
that
i
believe
can
help
create
web
component_1
that
be
more
quality_attribute_3
quality_attribute_4
and
easy
to
understand
in
any
programming
technology_5
component_7
layerthe
component_7
pattern_3
be
a
common
to
your
component_5
component_8
that
different
component_9
a
web

a
command
line
technology_10
or
a
schedule
can
use
accord
to
pattern_1
of
requirement_2
component_5
architecture
the
component_7
layerdefines
an
application’s
boundary
with
a
pattern_3
of
component_10
that
establish
a
set
of
quality_attribute_2
and
coordinate
the
application’s
connector_2
in
each

the
component_7
pattern_3
component_11
p
of
eaa
catalog
in
it
basic
form
a
component_7
pattern_3
provide
a
set
of
that
any
other
component_4
can
use
the
component_7
pattern_3
itself
then
connector_1
the
component_5
component_8
and
make
connector_data_3
to
the
component_12
or
component_13
it
do
not
have
to
be
a
but
can
also
be
a
set
of
that
be
publicly
connector_3
in
the
component_14
of
web
apis
both
way
offer
several
advantage
separation
of
concern
and
quality_attribute_5
instead
of
connector_4
all
requirement_3
directly
e
g
in
the
pattern_4
action
or
connector_5
pattern_5
of
a
web
technology_2
the
component_7
pattern_3
allow
to
test
the
component_5
component_8
separate
from
how
it
be
be
connector_6
a
cli
gui
or
web
technology_2
that
us
the
component_7
pattern_3
then
only
need
requirement_4
test
instead
of
have
to
test
the
requirement_4
and
component_5
component_8
at
the
same
time
self
document
developer
can
see
what
the
component_5
provide
in
the
component_14
of
the
programming
technology_5

or
that
can
be
connector_data_2
instead
of
have
to
connector_7
often
outdated
documentation
or
reverse
engineer
external
technology_11
component_15

transport
agnostic
different
component_4
a
connector_data_4
component_16
requirement_4
or
a
schedule
can
use
the
component_5
directly
or
through
a
more
appropriate
transport
technology_3
without
be
force
to
use
technology_11
restrepresentational
state
transfer
rest
be
an
architectural
style
that
define
a
set
of
constraint
for
create
web
apis
the
term
be
coin
by
roy

in
his
phd
thesis
and
expand
many
of
the
design
decision
that
go
into
the
technology_11
technology_3
into
a
more
high
level
architecture
although
it
be
most
often
use
in
the
component_14
of
technology_11
pattern_6
be
an
architectural
design
pattern_1
and
not
a
connector_8
technology_3
a
one
implementation
of
the
pattern_6
architecture
technology_11
be
consider
a
pattern_7
technology_3
constraintssince
it
be
not
a
formally
define
technology_3
there
be
many
opinion
on
the
detail
of
connector_4
pattern_6
apis
however
the
follow
five
constraint
must
be
present
for
any
component_5
to
be
consider
restful
component_4
component_3
a
pattern_8
architecture
allow
a
clear
separation
of
concern
the
component_4
be
responsible
for
connector_data_5
and
display
the
connector_data_1
while
the
component_3
be
take
care
of
connector_data_1
storage
and
component_5
component_8
one
advantage
be
that
both
side
can
be
develop
separately
a
long
a
the
agree
upon
connector_data_5
technology_12
be
follow
statelessness
connector_8
between
component_4
and
component_3
be
stateless
this
mean
that
every
component_4
connector_data_5
contain
all
the
connector_data_6
necessary
for
the
component_3
to
component_17
the
connector_data_5
this
further
reduce
component_3
complexity
since
no
global
state
other
than
a
possibly
connector_9
component_12
be
necessary
and
improve
quality_attribute_6
since
any
connector_data_5
can
be
component_17
by
any
component_3
pattern_9
stateless
pattern_8
connector_8
can
increase
component_3
load
since
some
connector_data_6
have
to
be
transfer
several
time
so
connector_data_7
that
only
connector_10
connector_data_1
should
be
pattern_9
able
pattern_3
component_6
a
key
feature
of
most
requirement_5
component_6
in
the
component_14
of
rest
this
mean
that
a
component_4
can
not
necessarily
tell
if
it
be
directly
connector_11
with
the
component_3
or
an
intermediate
pattern_10
uniform

pattern_6
define
a
set
of
well
define
that
can
be
connector_12
on
a
resource
these
will
be
discuss
below
resource
and
operationsone
of
the
key
concept
of
pattern_6
and
the
technology_11
technology_3
be
resource
a
resource
can
be
anything
that
be
uniquely
addressable
this

a
connector_data_8
of
all
my

a
on
a
component_3
an
entry
in
a
component_12
or
the
weather
connector_data_1
for
a
location
the
technology_11
technology_3
define
a
set
of
that
can
be
connector_12
on
a
single
or
multiple
resource
connector_13
a
quality_attribute_7
connector_7
only
that
connector_14
a
single
or
a
connector_data_8
of
resource

create
a
resource
put
completely
replace
the
resource
s
at
the
give
location
with
the
connector_data_1
patch
merge
the
resource
s
at
the
give
location
with
the
connector_data_1
delete
delete
the
resource
s
at
a
location
head
same
a
connector_13
but
only

the
and
no
connector_data_1
the
concept
of
resource
and
be
well
define
in
the
technology_11
specification
interestingly
this
be
something
very
few
web
technology_2
actively
try
to
help
with
instead
of
help
to
deal
with
resource
and
those
they
either
focus
on
low
level
handle
of
individual
technology_11
connector_data_7
and
connector_2
connector_15

etc
or
force
the
resource
orient
technology_11
technology_3
and
it
into
arbitrary
pattern_4
action
i
still
believe
that
the
inconsistency
in
many
web
component_1
that
claim
to
be
pattern_7
be
not
a
problem
of
pattern_6
a
an
architecture
but
of
web
technology_2
fail
to
provide
the
connector_data_9
to
follow
it
properly
ultimately
it
be
mostly
a
conceptual
connector_16
in
how
to
approach
an
component_5

instead
of
connector_4
action
createuser
resetpassword
or
sendmessage
we
can
look
at
it
from
the
perspective
of
resource
and
component_18
create
component_18
patch
{
password
}
or
connector_data_4
create
if
we
limit
the
to
those
already
define
in
the
technology_11
technology_3
this
connector_data_10
naturally
to
a
web
technology_13
a
pattern_7
component_7
layerin
the
component_7
pattern_3
section
we
look
at
the
advantage
that
it
can
bring
to
quality_attribute_5
technology_3
independence
and
self
documentation
this
can
now
be
combine
with
the
pattern_6
constraint
of
resource
and
a
uniform
to
create
a
technology_3
independent
component_7
that
mirror
the
technology_11

it
give
u
an
intuitive
but
powerful
abstraction
for
deal
with
almost
any
kind
of
connector_data_1
this
allow
u
to
connector_1
our
component_5
component_8
in
a
resource
orient
way
with
all
the
advantage
discuss
in
the
component_7
pattern_3
and
pattern_6
section
although
it
directly
reflect
the
technology_11

it
be
technology_3
independent
and
we
do
not
have
to
connector_17
individual
technology_11
connector_data_5
and
connector_2
pattern_5
instead
this
can
be
do
in
a
separate
pattern_5
that
only
have
to
about
this
component_7

separate
pattern_7
component_10
and
technology_11
transportanother
advantage
of
this
approach
be
that
we
can
pattern_5
for
other
technology_3
without
have
to
connector_16
our
component_7
websockets
for
example
can
not
connector_18
from
the
component_3
to
the
component_4
most
technology_14
technology_15
allow
fully
pattern_11
directional
connector_8
that
can
completely
replace
technology_11
and
often
also
be
fast

a
technology_14
pattern_5
without
connector_16
the
pattern_7
servicesmiddlewarewhile
the
pattern_7
component_7
pattern_3
give
u
a
neat
to
create
pattern_7
web
apis
most
component_2
also
require
requirement_3
that
be
not
part
of
a
component_10
core
responsibility
or
that
apply
to
multiple
component_10
cross
cut

when
an

be
submittedthe
solution
have
many
different
name
technology_16
unix
pip
aspect
orient
programming
feather
hook
but
it
all
come
down
to
the
same
thing
what
we
need
be
a
way
to
register
requirement_3
that
run
before
or
after
a

it
should
have
connector_6
to
the
component_14
of
the
connector_data_2
and
can
decide
when
and
if
it
want
to
pass
control
to
the
next
step
it
also
run
further
requirement_3
once
all
other
technology_16
have
complete
e
g
for
requirement_7
or

connector_data_6
to
the
connector_data_11
in
aspect
orient
programming
which
allow
to
additional
requirement_3
into

this
be
do
at
compile
time
for
dynamic
technology_5
it
can
be
a
little
more
quality_attribute_3
by
extend
the
at
runtime
one
pattern_1
use
for
this
in
technology_5
that
allow
a
more
functional
approach
be
the
so
connector_20
continuation
pass
style
in
functional
programming
continuation
pass
style
cps
be
a
style
of
programming
in
which
control
be
pass
explicitly
in
the
form
of
a
continuation
this
wikipedia
definition
might
sound
a
little
abstract
but
it
be
very
common
especially
in
nodejs
where
it
be

a
technology_16
and
popularize
by
web
technology_2
express
and
koa
the
idea
be
to
have
pattern_3
of
technology_11
connector_data_5
connector_2
pattern_5
that
each
do
something
specific
and
can
decide
when
to
pass
component_17
on
to
the
next
pattern_5
the
follow
example
show
a
koa
component_5
with
technology_16
thatstores
the
connector_data_5
start
time
then
continue
to
the
next
pattern_5
once
all
follow
pattern_5
complete
it
will
calculate
the
total
time
and
requirement_7
itsets
the
body
to
a
{
connector_data_4
hello
world
}
connector_data_12
which
will
be
serialize
a
jsonadds
the
current
connector_data_5
url
to
the
body
objectalthough
most
popular
for
handle
technology_11
connector_data_7
this
pattern_1
be
generally
very
helpful
for
anything
that
require
a
quality_attribute_8
pattern_12
component_17
workflow
apply
to
our
pattern_7
component_7
pattern_3
we
can
register
the
same
kind
of
technology_16
for
each

technology_16
inside
the
component_7
layerinstead
of
the
technology_11
connector_data_5
or
connector_2
in
the
component_14
it
contain
technology_3
independent
connector_data_6
about
the
parameter
e
g

connector_data_1
or
params
and
how
it
be
connector_20
e
g
the
name
and
component_7
connector_data_12
here
we
can
already
see
how
the
runtime
and
createdat
technology_16
could
be
use
with
any
other
component_7
independent
of
the
component_12
and
without
have
to
be
modify
real
timereal
time
connector_data_13
mean
that
component_9
connector_13
actively
connector_21
about
connector_22
in
the
component_6
it
be
not
a
part
of
the
pattern_6
architecture
or
the
technology_11
technology_3
but
it
fit
almost
naturally
into
the
concept
of
the
uniform

since
we
the
side
effect
of
each
we
can
automatically
connector_18
certain
connector_data_14
once
they
complete
component_4
can
then
listen
to
the
they
be
interest
in
and
update
their
state
accordingly
this
also
fit
well
into
the
pattern_7
component_7
pattern_3
and
technology_16
pattern_1
connector_23
those
can
be
connector_1
a
another
technology_16
that
run
last
and
publish
the
final
connector_data_11
even
though
technology_11
do
not
support
real
time
update
component_9
use
other
technology_3

websockets
can
also
still
be
connector_21
about
those
through
their
technology_3
pattern_5
flow
of
an
technology_11
component_4
create
a
connector_data_4
and
a
technology_14
component_4
be
connector_21
about
itthis
be
a
great
middle
grind
between
completely
custom
technology_14
and
proprietary
real
time
solution
technology_17
key
requirement_8
observation
with
completely
custom
it
be
all
up
to
the
developer
to
what
the
mean
and
make
the
appropriate
connector_data_13
whereas
out
of
the
component_19
solution
technology_17
or
technology_18
use
real
time
technology_3
that
be
difficult
to
use
directly
and
usually
require
specific
component_4
side
technology_15
with
from
pattern_7
component_10
we
which
we
will
connector_13
and
what
connector_data_1
to
expect
this
allow
to
create
generic
technology_10
without
have
to
connector_1
a
complex
real
time
connector_data_1
technology_3
these
combine
especially
well
with
functional
reactive
programming
frp
to
create
component_18
base
on
real
time
connector_data_1
connector_24
i
plan
on
discuss
this
more
in
a
future
but
to
connector_13
a
quality_attribute_9
idea
the
follow
video
show
an
introduction
to
feather
and
how
to
use
those
and
frp
to
create
a
real
time
component_5
in
technology_19
wrap
updesign
pattern_1
be
best
practise
that
can
help
u
create
that
be
more
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_3
and
easy
to
understand
no
matter
which
programming
technology_5
or
technology_2
in
this
we
look
at
several
design
and
architectural
pattern_1
that
can
help

i
believe
that
especially
the

approach
will
be
very
important
for
the
future
of
