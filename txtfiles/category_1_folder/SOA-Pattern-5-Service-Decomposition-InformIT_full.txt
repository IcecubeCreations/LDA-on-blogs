a
component_1
inventory
be
a
live
body
of
component_2
that
individually
will
need
the
freedom
to
quality_attribute_1
independently
over
time
what
we

when
document
the
pattern_1
design
pattern_2
catalog
be
that
there
be
pattern_2
that
emerge
not
only
at
design
time
but
also
during
this

implementation
evolutionary
stage
in
a
service‚Äôs
lifecycle
there
be
one
common
scenario
that
repeatedly
surface
in
many
project
when
we
component_4
and
design
component_2
during
early
stage
of
pattern_1
adoption
we
be
constrain
by
current
infrastructure
and
technology_1
these
constraint
require
that
we
limit
the
size
of
component_1
composition
and
the
extent
of
cross
component_1
connector_data_1
exchange
a
a
connector_data_2
each
component_1
encompass
more
component_5
and
be
coarse
grain
our
infrastructure
improve
over
time
because
of
component_6
upgrade
or
fund
for
quality_attribute_2
hardware
etc
our
exist
component_1
composition
be
comprise
of
coarse
grain
component_2
that
be
connector_4
within
the
parameter
of
the
old
environment
however
we
now
realize
that
component_2
could
be
more
fine
grain
and
could
perform
and
be
compose
more
effectively
because
the
infrastructure
can
support
large
component_1
composition
it
be
in
connector_5
to
this
situation
that
the
component_1
decomposition
pattern_2
provide
a
technique
for
split
up
a
component_1
after
it
initial
deployment
into
two
or
more
fine
grain
component_1
of

such
an
approach
will
raise
a
few
eyebrow
from
those
involve
in
version
control
and
connector_6
requirement_1
how
can
we
break
apart
a
component_1
with
an
establish
contract
without
impact
all
of
the
component_7
component_8
that
have
be
use
the
component_1
and
have
form
very
real
runtime
connector_7
on
how
it
currently
exist
to
connector_8
these
issue
the
component_1
decomposition
pattern_2
need
the
help
of
several
other
pattern_1
design
pattern_2
pattern_3
capability
‚Äì
when
component_5
be
move
from
one
component_1
to
another
this
pattern_2
can
be
use
to
preserve
the
original
capability
that
be
express
a
part
of
the
original
service‚Äôs
contract
component_1
fa√ßade
‚Äì
in
support
of
enabling
pattern_3
capability
this
multi
purpose
pattern_2
can
be
use
to
establish
within
the
original
component_1
component_5
a
fa√ßade
pattern_4
of
component_9
that
act
a
a
liaison
between
the
original
component_1
and
the
component_1
the
fa√ßade
component_10
actually
invoke
the
correspond
capability
on
the
newly
create
component_1
thereby
act
a
it
component_1
component_7
on
behalf
of
the
component_7
of
the
original
component_1
when
apply
these
two
pattern_2
together
with
component_1
decomposition
the
fa√ßade
component_5
can
also
be
design
to
compensate
for
a
connector_6
in
behavior
that
be
likely
to
occur
a
a
connector_data_2
of
physically
move
a
segment
of
the
original
component_1
component_5
into
a
location
an
important
requirement
for
the
decomposition
of
a
component_1
to
be
successful
be
that
the
connector_data_2
more
fine
grain
component_2
have
distinct
functional
component_11
when
component_4
and
design
these
component_1
all
applicable
component_1
orientation
principle
and
pattern_2
must
be
consider
a
with
any
other
component_1
other
fundamental
pattern_2
such
a
component_1
normalization
also
need
to
be
apply
to
ensure
that
the
component_2
properly
line
up
with
the
others
in
the
exist
component_1
inventory
one
common
problem
with

implementation
component_1
decomposition
however
be
that
a
give
set
of
capability
not
correspond
cleanly
to
the
functional
component_11
of
the
component_1
what
this
mean
be
that
a
component_1
only
require
a
portion
of
what
the
original
component_1
capability
represent
there
be
several
way
of
deal
with
this
include
a
hybrid
component_12
of
the
pattern_3
capability
pattern_2
where
the
original
component_1
retain
some
of
it
component_5
but
then
still
connector_data_3
a
component_1
for
the
portion
that
now
belong
elsewhere
however
there
be
yet
another
pattern_2
we
can
take
into
account
early
on
during
the
initial
component_4
stage
of
the
original
component_1
in
anticipation
of
future
decomposition
requirement
this
pattern_2
be
connector_9
decompose
capability
and
it
essentially
ask
u
to
think
ahead
a
to
how
a
give
coarse
grain
component_1
component_11
can
be
split
into
multiple
fine
grain
component_11
and
to
then
align
the
initial
component_1
capability
