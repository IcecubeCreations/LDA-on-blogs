in

this
solve
part

component_7
installation
before
start
the
project
we
need
to
download
technology_7
and
technology_1
you
can
download
technology_1
from
here
extract
the
content
of
the
compress
into
a
folder
of
your
preference
inside
the
technology_1
directory
go
to
the
bin
folder
here
you’ll
find
many
bash
script
that
will
be
useful
for
run
a
technology_1
component_2
if
you
be
use
window
you
also
have
the
same
script
inside
the

folder
this
us
linux
command
but
you
need
to
use
the
equivalent
window
version
if
you’re
run
a
o
start
technology_7
technology_7
be
basically
to
manage
the
technology_1
cluster
it
come
bundle
with
the
download
technology_1
directory
so
we
need
not
download
it
separately
to
start

go

and
enter

make
sure
the

be

because
technology_1
connector_7
connector_data_3
such
a
offset
connector_data_3
keep
in
the
component_9
from

create
a

after
run
technology_7
and

technology_1
respectively
we
can
create

here
we

to

we

late
in

now

s
connector_10
some

backend
development
with

and

we

develop

in

for

why
websockets
since
technology_6
technology_1
cannot
connector_8
the
component_11
connector_data_5
instantly
to
the
component_12
with
classical
connector_12
and

i
perform
these
use
websockets
which
provide
full

bidirectional
connector_3
which
mean
that
connector_data_3
can
flow
from
the
component_12
to
the
component_8
and
also
in
the
opposite
direction
simultaneously
it
be
widely
use
in

create

develop

this
create
a
producerfactory
which

how
to
create
component_14
base
on
the
configuration
we
provide
we
also
declare
a
kafkatemplate
component_15
to
perform
high
level
on
your
component_10
in
other
word
the
template
can
do
such
a
connector_14
a
connector_data_2
to
a
topic
and
efficiently
hide
under
the
hood
detail
from
you
in
producerconfigurations

we
need
to
perform
the
follow
connector_data_8
bootstrap_servers_config
to
set
the
component_8
connector_15
on
which
technology_1
be
run
key_serializer_class_config
and
value_serializer_class_config
to
deserialize
the
key
and
requirement_4
from
the
technology_1
component_16
the
next
step
be
to
create
an
to
connector_8
the
connector_data_5
to
the
technology_1
topic
create
the
follow
pattern_6
for
that

a
you
can
see
the
be
quite
quality_attribute_1
when
we
do

to

connector_8
it
inject
the
kafkatemplate
configure
early
and
connector_17
a
connector_data_2
to
the

which
we
create

s
test
everything
we
build
until
now
run

from
the

line
connector_18
the
follow
command
mvn
technology_8
boot
run
enter

exit

mode
your
component_8
should
be
run
on
port

and
you
can
make
component_17
connector_data_10
against
it
you
can
use
postman
to
do
a
connector_data_9
a
show
below
but
how
do
you
the
command
successfully
connector_19
a
connector_data_2
to
the
topic
right
now
you
don’t
connector_20
connector_data_5
inside
your
component_1
which
mean
you
cannot
be
sure
fortunately
there
be
an
easy
way
to
create
a
component_11
to
test
right
away
inside
the
bin
folder
of
your
technology_1
directory
run
the
follow

run

s
achieve

use

we

in

develop

hi
great

i
have
a
question
though
why
use
technology_1
at
all
if
we
re
already
use
technology_12
cause
technology_12
also
connector_25
the
connector_data_4
to
the
component_12
alright
i
would
really
appreciate
if
you
answer
my
question
😊

use
only
websockets
would
be
great
for
this
component_2
there
be
no
need
for
an
additional
dependancy
on
technology_1
suppose
you
have
a
more
complex
chat
component_2
that
be
quality_attribute_5
for
cat
😅
eg
a
image
you
connector_8
need
to
be
scan
for
dog
before
connector_14
it
or
else
it
ll
scare
cat
in
this
requirement_6
you
can
have
a
dog
detection
component_21
that
listen
for
on
the
image
topic
and
run
the
image
through
a
ml
component_13
that
scan
for
dog
the
component_21
can
then
publish
to
a
connector_data_2
topic
which
can
then
be
connector_20
by
a
connector_data_2
component_21
that
connector_26
a
technology_12
for
the
ui
to
connector_20
this
way
technology_1
help
to
isolate
component_2
component_24
the
connector_data_2
component_21
need
to
connector_8
in
the
connector_data_2
topic
