i
be
connector_data_1
with
connector_1
a
technology_2
connector_data_2
notation
technology_3
use
technology_4
in
my
project
the
technology_1
contain
property
connector_data_3
to
be
use
inside
the
component_1
there
be
many
technology_5
quality_attribute_1
for
connector_1
or
requirement_1
technology_1
connector_data_4
in
technology_4
but
in
particular
we
be
go
to
be
use
the
technology_5
find
on
technology_3
let’s
take
a
technology_1
connector_2
property
technology_3
that
contain
the
follow
connector_data_4
{
name
jsonparser
version
description
requirement_1
some
technology_1
connector_data_4
keywords
technology_3
requirement_1
connector_data_5
}
this
contain
a
technology_1
connector_data_2
that
also
contain
a
technology_1
to
keep
thing
quality_attribute_2
in
this
example
we
be
only
go
to
it
out
it
be
now
time
to
create
our
technology_4
project
if
you
keep
up
with
my
other
you’ll
we
aren’t
go
to
be
use
an
ide
such
a
eclipse
instead
we
be
go
to
be
use
a
text
editor
and
a
command
prompt
our
project
connector_data_6
be
go
to
look
the
follow
jsonparser
src
technology_3
technology_1
technology_5
here
jsonparser
maindriver
technology_4
lib
build
technology_6
property
technology_3
if
you’re
a
technology_4
veteran
you’ll
right
away
after
see
build
technology_6
that
we’ll
be
use
technology_7
ant
to
build
our
project
feel
free
to
connector_3
it
to
your
preference
first
we
want
to
download
the
technology_1
technology_5
and
place
them
all
in
the
src
technology_3
directory
with
this
do
open
your
maindriver
technology_4
and
the
follow
two
package
jsonparser
technology_4
io
*
technology_3
*
maindriver
{
args
{
}
readfile
filename
{
}
}
the
readfile
filename
will
connector_4
a
text
and
it
a
a
single
the
args
will
be
where
we
fiddle
with
all
the
technology_1
connector_data_4
use
this
a
a
reference
make
your
readfile
filename
look
the
follow
readfile
filename
{
connector_data_7
=
try
{
bufferedreader
br
=
bufferedreader
filereader
filename
stringbuilder
sb
=
stringbuilder
line
=
br
readline
while
line
=
{
sb
append
line
line
=
br
readline
}
connector_data_7
=
sb
tostring
}
catch
exception
e
{
e
printstacktrace
}
connector_data_7
}
again
the
above
will
only
connector_4
a
text
and
it
a
connector_data_4
now
take
a
look
at
the
args
which
will
take
care
of
various
technology_1
work
args
{
jsondata
=
readfile
property
technology_3
jobj
=
jsondata
jsonarray
jarr
=
jsonarray
jobj
getjsonarray
keywords
tostring
component_2
out
name
+
jobj
getstring
name
for
i
=
i
jarr
length
i++
{
component_2
out
keyword
+
jarr
getstring
i
}
}
in
the
above
you
can
see
that
we’ve
connector_5
our
technology_1
convert
the
into
a
and
then
extract
the
keywords
finally
the
connector_data_4
we
obtain
be
out
there
be
many
other
great
technology_1
to
make
use
of
all
of
which
can
be
find
in
the
javadocs
for
the
technology_5
if
you’re
not
sure
how
to
make
an
technology_7

it

another
common
