goal
of
this
be
to
give
you
a
collection
of
recommend
best

for
build
technology_2
pattern_2

use

these
recommendation
be
design
to
help
you
create
an
quality_attribute_1
quality_attribute_2
and
quality_attribute_3
technology_1
base
pattern_1
technology_1
have
become
the
de
facto
technology_3
for
java™
pattern_1
it
have
many
purpose
build
feature
that
ease
build
run
your
pattern_1
in
production
at
large
quality_attribute_4
this
connector_data_1
of
best
practice
be
build
base
on
my
experience
in
run
pattern_1
base
architecture
on
technology_4
component_1
gke
i
have
see
and
apply
these
approach
in
several
project
and
over
the
year
i
have
form
a
pretty
strong
opinion
about
them
we
will
walk
through
the
different
factor
and
guideline
that
should
be
consider
when
build
rest
base
pattern_1
use
technology_1
boot
and
explain
how
they
help
you
to
connector_1
more
quality_attribute_5
well
found
and
successful
pattern_1
this
assume
that
you
be
familiar
with
technology_2
technology_1
concept
such
a
technology_1
connector_data_2
technology_5
technology_1
connector_data_2
rest
technology_6
technology_4
basic
concept
and
general
knowledge
in
pattern_1
architecture
give
that
connector_2
pattern_1
architecture
with
a
foundation
of
best
practice
can
drastically
improve
your
architecture
however
we
focus
only
on
the
rest
base
pattern_1
without
consider
other
type
pattern_3
pattern_1
you
or
not
agree
with
some
of
the
best
practice
present
here
and
that’s
fine
a
long
a
it
drive
you
to
research
and
examine
these
best
practice
while
develop
technology_1
base
pattern_1
that
will
help
you
to
build
quality_attribute_6
pattern_1
a
much
a
possible
design
pattern_2
component_2
optimallyas
a
general
best
practice
you
should
group
all
relate
component_2
in
single
pattern_4
orient
around
a
use
requirement_1
e
g
aggregator
component_2
or
domain
apis
while
keep
them
clean
and
focus
you
should
follow
the
best
practice
for
the
pattern_2
component_2
design
such
a
use
noun
instead
of
verb
in
the
path
which
represent
component_3
resource
to
fetch
or
manipulate
and
use
consistently
plural
noun
such
a
order
{id}
technology_7
over
order
{id}
technology_7
the
must
be
represent
by
the
technology_8
connector_data_3
connector_3
connector_4
resource
create
a
connector_data_2
component_4
put
connector_data_4
exist
connector_data_2
delete
remove
datanesting
resource
for
hierarchical
objectsprovide
pattern_5
sorting
and
paginationconsider
component_5
versioningapis
should
be
fully
document
pattern_4
be
not
suppose
to
perform
any
requirement_2
component_6
apart
from
connector_5
and
delegate
the
action
to
the
proper
component_7
you
must
enforce
separation
of
concern
by
keep
the
pattern_4
a
light
a
possible
let’s
take
a
look
at
an
example
of
a
pattern_2
pattern_4
consider
the
above
point
ordercontrollerthe
@requestmapping
annotation
provide
“routing”
connector_data_5
use
the
connector_6
and
produce
annotation
to
define
what
the
connector_7
for
the
connector_data_3
connector_data_6
and
what
it

a
a
connector_8
where
technology_9
be
use
in
99%
of
requirement_1
it
for
pattern_2
apis
give
component_8
and
component_9
side
technology_10
have
technology_11
that
can
encode
decode
technology_9
without
do
much
work
the
@operation
&
@apiresponse
annotation
allow
you
to
some
description
to
the
component_5
documentation
with
the
open
component_5


specification
for
instance
here
be
the
technology_12
ui
component_10
for
our
apis
openapi

documentation
with
technology_12
uiin
a
nutshell
it
be
important
to
design
pattern_2
component_2
properly
while
at
least
consider
the
requirement_3
and
ease
of
use
for
the
component_5
component_9
entitiesit
be
strongly
recommend
that
you
use
a
base
for
component_11
with
manually
assign
customize
identifier
and
common
property
a
show
in
the
follow
example
baseentitybaseidentifiergeneratoruse
connector_data_2
transfer
connector_data_7
dtos
while
it
be
also
always
possible
to
connector_9
directly
the
technology_5
component_12
component_11
representation
in
the
pattern_2
to
connector_10
connector_11
connector_data_2
from
the
component_9
however
this
be
not
the
best
approach
even
though
it
sound
the
easy
and
obvious
way
there
be
several
reason
to
do
not
that
it
create
high
couple
between
the
persistence
component_13
and
the
component_5
component_14
the
complexity
of
the
hide
or
adjust
some
requirement_4
in
the
component_5
connector_8
base
on
the
component_15
role
and
connector_12
permission
or
some
other
requirement_2
rulespossible
vulnerability
or
misuse
by
when
the
component_9
be
able
to
override
some
auto
generate
component_12
such
a
primary
or
modify
date
time
or
component_16
accessit
connector_13
the
implementation
detail
of
the
applicationit
make
it
hard
to

remove
or
update
any
of
the
component_12
component_11
without
connector_14
the
component_5
or
connector_14
the
connector_data_2

by
a
pattern_2
without
connector_14
the
internal
component_12
structuresupporting
multiple
version
of
an
component_5
become
more
challengingthe
quality_attribute_6
approach
be
conceptually
a
more
quality_attribute_7
one
which
be
define
a
separate
connector_data_2
transfer
connector_data_8
dto
that
represent
the
component_5
resource
which
be
connector_data_9
from
a
component_12
component_3
or
multiple
component_3
give
that
they
be
serialize
and
deserialized
in
the
technology_13
her
be
an
example
of
design
a
dto
for
an
component_3
a
dto
for
create
a
order
that
contain
only
property
can
be
set
by
the
component_5
component_9
on
the
other
hand
you
won’t
need
to
connector_data_9
your
persistence
component_11
to
dtos
and
vice
versa
manually
you
can
use
a
technology_11
modelmapper
or
mapstruct
that
handle
the
conversion
automatically
a
a
summary
use
dtos
enable
the
pattern_2
component_2
and
the
persistence
pattern_6
to
quality_attribute_8
independently
of
each
other
leverage
technology_2
component_17
validationbefore
transform
dto
to
your
component_5
resource
you
always
want
to
ensure
that
the
dto
have
valid
connector_data_2
where
it
should
be
assume
to
be
bad
until
it’s
be
through
some
kind
of
validation
component_18
javax
validation
be
the
top
level
package
for
component_17
validation
component_5
and
it
have
some
predefined
annotation
base
constraint
so
you
can
annotate
the
dto
component_3
with
javax
validation
constraint
*
such
a
@notnull
@min
@max
and
@size
@notempty
and
@email
a
show
in
the
orderincomingdto

we
should
annotate
pattern_4
input
with
@valid
to
enable
component_17
validation
and
activate
these
constraint
on
the
income
@requestbody
if
the
component_17
validation
be
fail

bad
connector_data_3
in
the
next
section
i
will
describe
how
to
customize
the
error
connector_8
for
the
validation
error
use
global
custom
error
handlerbecause
there
be
multiple
way
a
component_7
can
crash
or
break
we
must
ensure
that
any
pattern_2
component_2
handle
error
gracefully
use
technology_3
technology_8
cod
that
help
component_19
in
such
requirement_1
it
be
always
recommend
to
build
out
meaningful
error
connector_data_10
for
the
component_9
with
the
clear
goal
of
give
that
component_9
all
the
info
to
easily
diagnose
the
problem
the
follow
example
show
how
to
define
a
general
exception

by
extend

responseentityexceptionhandler
generalexceptionhandlerto
summarize
a
few
point
to
consider
for

handle
a
connector_1
in
the
above

to
a
correct
status
for
each
type
of
exception
such
a
bad_request

for
connector_data_11
with
invalid
connector_data_2
include
all
relevant
connector_data_5
in
the
connector_8
bodyhandling
all

in
a
standardize
waylog
all

connector_data_12
and

and

purposesand
here
be
an
example
of
the

connector_8
in
requirement_1
of
validation
error
invalid
connector_data_3
for
create
a
order
use
component_12
migration
toolsit
be
always
easy
and
quality_attribute_7
to
start
with
the
auto
generation
of
the
component_12
schema
base
on
the
component_3
definition
when
use
a
relational
component_12
with
technology_1
use
the
ddl
generation
of
technology_1
connector_data_2
technology_5
by

schema
technology_14
and
connector_data_2
sqlfiles
or

technology_15
to
automatically
create
the
schema
by
set
technology_1
technology_5
technology_15
ddl
auto
to
create
or
update
however
it
be
highly
recommend
to
use
high
level
migration
technology_16
flyway
or
technology_17
such
technology_16
provide
u
a
version
control
of
the
component_12
schema
and
keep
track
of
the
current
state
of
the
component_12
and
determine
the
require
step
to
migrate
the
component_12
schema
in
a
fine
grain
way
property
and
configurationaccording
to
the

factor
component_20
methodology
configuration
that
vary
among
deployment
environment
should
be
update
without
connector_14
any

in
practice
they
be
component_21
in
environment
variable
fortunately
technology_1
make
this
relatively
straightforward
where
you
define
configuration
with
placeholder
in
component_20
property
these
configuration
property
can
be
set
on
the
command
line
or
by
update
environment
variable
for
example
you
can
configure
the
technology_1
connector_data_2
technology_5
include
technology_18
datasource
and
technology_15
property
a
follow
for
instance
you
can
define
the
requirement_4
of
a
property
through
the
technology_4
deployment’s
environment
variable
also
worth
mention
that
technology_1
support
configuration
per
environment
base
on
the
active
profile
we
can
connector_14
