there
be
nothing
bad
than
be
on
a
development
project
where
the
architect
have
come
off
a
five
day
train
on
component_4
orient
architecture
because
that
architect
want
to
refractor
every
and
into
an
and
an
implementation
all
in
the
name
of
loose
couple
and
while
the
intention
be
valiant
the
effort
put
into
such
an
endeavor
be
not
so
when
do
loose
couple
make
sense
here
be
three
instance
when
loose
couple
be
worth
the
effort
connector_4
between
physical
connector_1
pattern_4
if
you
re
component_5
be
move
connector_data_1
across
a
requirement_1
the
way
your
component_5
connector_5
with
the
lower
level
transport
component_6
need
to
be
abstract
away
after
all
transport
mechanism
can
connector_6
requirement_1
technology_6
will
quality_attribute_4
and
even
more
importantly
the
connector_data_1
transfer
technology_7
might
connector_7
switch
for
example
one
day
your
component_5
might
be
connector_8
connector_data_2
over
technology_8
while
the
next
the
remote
component_7
you
be
invoke
require
a
technology_9
if
the
physical
connector_9
pattern_4
be
loosely
couple
your
component_5
can
easily
adjust
to
such
connector_6
connector_4
between
logical
pattern_4
all
component_8
should
be
develop
use
at
the
very
least
a
component_9
pattern_5
pattern_6
mvc
type
architecture
with
those
three
pattern_4
have
three
distinct
responsibility
more
pattern_4
tend
to
be
to
more
complex
component_5
be
it
a
dedicate
connector_data_1
pattern_4
a
validation
pattern_4
or
quality_attribute_1
mechanism
but
connector_4
between
each
of
these
clear
logical
pattern_4
should
be
abstract
away
why
one
reason
be
the
fact
that
a
an
component_5
quality_attribute_5
some
of
these
logical
pattern_4
end
up
be
separate
into
physical
pattern_4
for
example
heavy
requirement_6
or
component_3
component_10
might
be
place
on
a
separate
physical
component_11
separate
from
the
presentation
or
pattern_5
pattern_4
if
the
various
pattern_4
be
loosely
couple
it
would
be
easy
to
make
this
type
of
a
connector_6
another
reason
to
loosely
couple
logical
pattern_4
be
the
fact
that
it
make
test
easy
a
the
various
pattern_4
can
be
easily
mock
out
or
have
fake
or
stub
create
that
can
reproduce
another
pattern_4
s
behavior
when
isolate
test
need
to
be
do
loosely
couple
pattern_4
can
make
test
easy
which
in
turn
make
isolate
and
troubleshoot
bug
and
problem
much
easy
a
clearly
identifiable
pluggability
point
the
third
time
a
loosely
couple
connector_4
make
sense
be
when
there
be
a
clear
and
obvious
pluggability
point
in
your
component_5
for
example
your
component_5
might
use
technology_10
to
persist
connector_data_1
but
there
s
always
a
quality_attribute_2
chance
you
decide
to
use
another
technology_11
technology_3
or
perhaps
even
use
technology_12
that
s
a
pretty
clear
plug
in
point
where
it
might
make
sense
to
connector_6
one
implementation
of
a
give
with
another
component_8
will
tend
to
have
a
bit
more
subtle
instance
for
abstraction
and
loose
couple
than
something
a
significant
a
the
technology_11
technology_3
of
choice
but
you
connector_7
the
idea
if
there
be
something
in
your
component_5
where
it
might
make
sense
to
swap
one
implementation
out
with
another
loosely
couple
the
connector_4
between
that
component_12
and
the
rest
of
your
component_5
now
that
might
not
be
an
exhaustive
connector_data_3
of
when
loose
couple
make
sense
but
it
be
a
pretty
quality_attribute_2
one
if
you
re
on
a
project
and
you
see
