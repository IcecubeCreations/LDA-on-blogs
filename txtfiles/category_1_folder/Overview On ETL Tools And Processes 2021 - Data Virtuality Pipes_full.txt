introduction
90%
of
today’s
connector_data_1
have
be
create
in
the
last
two
year
only
accord
to
domo
our
current
connector_data_1
output
be
roughly


quintillion
byte
per
day
a
you
can
imagine
there
be
a
lot
of
connector_data_1
generate
every
minute
over
the
year
and
through
technological
evolution
connector_data_1
have
become
an
essential
topic
and
a
key
factor
to
requirement_6
success
especially
component_2
them
the
right
way
have
become
a
crucial
solution
for
many
requirement_6
around
the
world
but
before
we
dive
into
this
topic
u
first
start
with
the
basic
what
be
connector_data_1
requirement_7
and
problem
deal
with
them
when
you
look
for
a
definition
of
connector_data_1
on
the
internet
you
will
connector_5
ton
of
different
one
but
for
our
purpose
we
will
stick
with
the
definition
of
connector_data_1
a
raw
or
unprocessed
connector_data_2
in
the
past
few
decade
these
raw
and
unprocessed
connector_data_2
gain
more
and
more
traction
because
requirement_8
realize
that
these
connector_data_1
could
connector_6
the
way
we
live
work
and
think
think
about
all
the
connector_data_1
that
every
requirement_6
already
own
and
so
the
buzz
around
requirement_7
start
however
requirement_6
also
realize
that
the
gigantic
amount
of
raw
and
unprocessed
connector_data_2
itself
wasn’t
of
big
requirement_9
until
they
could
be
pattern_1
analyze
and
interpret
well
only
well
analyze
and
interpret
connector_data_1
could
give
powerful
requirement_6
and
requirement_10
insight
and
the
big
problem
that
be
identify
be
with
traditional
technology_2
such
a
classic
technology_1
it
be
impossible
to
organize
and
connector_data_3
the
requirement_7
in
a
way
that
they
can
be
quickly
and
easily
connector_7
for
analysis
connector_data_1
requirement_11
solution
be
design
to
meet
the
big
part
of
an
organization’s
pattern_2
requirement
to
fulfill
this
some
technology_1
vendor
be
extend
their
technology_3
line
horizontally
by
connector_data_1
technology_2
and
feature
to
capture
real
time
connector_data_1
to
provide
a
complete
connector_data_1
requirement_5
solution
then
there
be
others
that
extend
vertically
by

more
feature
in
order
to
provide
a
complete
requirement_6
intelligence
solution
the
evolution
of
technology_1
in
order
to
benefit
from
all
the
connector_data_1
connector_data_1
requirement_12
and
technology_1
technology_2
be
invent
many
technology_1
technology_2
be
originally
develop
to
ease
the
development
of
connector_data_1
requirement_12
and
thereby
more
enjoyable
today
the
top
technology_1
technology_2
in
the
requirement_10
have
vastly
expand
their
requirement_13
for
connector_data_1
profile
connector_data_1
cleanse
requirement_14
component_3
requirement_11
eai
requirement_7
component_2
connector_data_1
governance
and
master
connector_data_1
requirement_5
once
the
connector_data_1
be
quality_attribute_1
in
a
connector_data_1
requirement_12
or
technology_6
online
analytical
component_2
cube
pattern_2
be
commonly
use
to
analyze
and
visualize
them
pattern_2
also
help
you
with
report
connector_data_1
discovery
connector_data_1
mining
and
dash
board
but
what
be
connector_data_1
requirement_12
and
technology_1
exactly
over
the
year
many
different
understand
of
these
two
term
have
quality_attribute_2
hence
let’s
set
a
common
grind
for
this
first
the
most
common
definition
for
connector_data_1
requirement_12
in
the
requirement_10
be
a
component_4
that
extract
clean
conform
and
connector_8
component_5
connector_data_1
into
a
target
storage
so
they
be
use
for
connector_9
and
analysis
the
connector_data_4
be
to
connector_10
quality_attribute_3
and
quality_attribute_4
connector_data_1
that
can
be
use
for
crucial
requirement_6
decision
in
order
to
achieve
that
connector_data_1
from
one
or
more
operational
component_4
need
to
be
extract
and
copy
into
the
connector_data_1
requirement_12
which
be
do
by
technology_1
technology_2
technology_1
be
the
abbreviation
for
extract
transform
and
load
and
what
these
technology_2
basically
do
be
to
connector_11
out
connector_data_1
from
one
or
even
multiple
component_6
s
and
place
them
in
one
component_6
the
so
connector_data_5
target
storage
how
do
the
technology_1
component_2
work
extract
the
extract
step
cover
the
connector_data_1
extraction
from
multiple
component_5
component_7
and
the
preparation
of
the
connector_data_1
for
the
next
step
the
objective
of
this
step
be
to
connector_12
all
the
require
connector_data_1
from
the
component_5
component_7
with
a
little
resource
a
possible
the
extract
step
be
suppose
to
be
design
in
such
a
way
that
it
do
not
negatively
affect
the
component_5
component_4
in
term
of
requirement_15
and
response_time
transform
the
transform
step
apply
a
set
of
rule
to
transform
the
connector_data_1
from
the
component_5
to
the
target
this
include
convert
all
extract
connector_data_1
to
the
same
dimension
use
the
same
unit
so
that
they
can
late
be
join
together
the
transformation
step
also
gather
connector_data_1
from
several
component_5
generate
calculate
requirement_9
and
apply
advance
validation
rule
load
during
the
loading
step
it
be
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
load
be
perform
correctly
and
with
a
little
resource
a
possible
during
the
loading
component_2
the
connector_data_1
be
connector_13
into
the
target
component_6
what
be
the
benefit
of
technology_1
the
benefit
of
technology_1
be
that
it
be
much
easy
and
fast
to
use
than
traditional
that
move
connector_data_1
by
manually
connector_14

quality_attribute_5
up
the
component_2
of
connector_data_6
component_8
and
column
between
the
component_5
and
target
storage
below
be
some
key
advantage
of
technology_1
technology_2
ease
of
use
through
automate
component_1
a
already
mention
in
the
begin
the
big
advantage
of
technology_1
technology_2
be
the
ease
of
use
after
you
choose
the
connector_data_1
component_5
the
technology_2
automatically
identify
the
type
and
technology_7
of
the
connector_data_1
set
the
rule
how
the
connector_data_1
have
to
be
extract
and
component_2
and
finally
load
the
connector_data_1
into
the
target
storage
this
make
cod
in
a
traditional
sense
where
you
have
to
connector_13
every
single

unnecessary

technology_1
technology_2
be
base
on
graphical
component_9

and
offer
a

the
benefit
that
we
have
elaborate
above
be
all
relate
to
traditional

however
traditional
technology_1
technology_2
cannot
keep
up
with
the
high
quality_attribute_5
of
connector_15
that
be
dominate
the
requirement_7

let’s
take
a
look
at
the
shortcoming
of
these
traditional
technology_1

traditional
technology_1
technology_2
be
highly
time
connector_19
component_2
connector_data_1
with
technology_1
mean
to
develop
a
component_2
in
multiple
step
every
time
connector_data_1
need
to
connector_5
move
and
transform
furthermore
traditional
technology_1
technology_2
be
inflexible
for
connector_15
and
cannot
load
readable
live
connector_data_1
into
the
pattern_2
component_13
we
also
have
to
mention
the
fact
that
it
be
not
only
a
costly
component_2
but
also
time
connector_19
and
we
all
that
time
be
money
there
be
some
factor
that
influence
the
of
technology_1
technology_2
and
component_2
these
factor
would
be
divide
in
the
follow
category
connector_data_1

connector_data_3
the
more
the
component_5

from
the
one
of
the

connector_data_1
the
more
complex
the
traditional
technology_1
component_2
and
quality_attribute_8
effort
become
due
to
the

include

it
make
no

to
load
the

a
an
example
if
the

we

perform

this

since

correctly
set

there
be
several
way
to

if

provide
an
