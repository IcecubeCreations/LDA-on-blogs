gentle
introduction
to
connector_1
processingwhat
be
connector_1
component_1
connector_1
component_1
be
a
requirement_1
technology_1
it
be
use
to
query
continuous
connector_data_1
connector_1
and
detect
condition
quickly
within
a
small
time
period
from
the
time
of
connector_2
the
connector_data_1
the
detection
time
period
vary
from
few
millisecond
to
minute
for
example
with
connector_1
component_1
you
can
connector_3
an
alert
when
the
pattern_1
have
reach
the
freeze
point
query
connector_data_1
connector_4
come
from
a
pattern_1
sensor
it
be
also
connector_5
by
many
name
real
time
requirement_2
connector_6
requirement_2
complex
component_1
real
time
connector_6
requirement_2
and
component_1
although
some
term
historically
have
difference
now
technology_2
technology_3
have
converge
under
term
connector_1
component_1
see
this
quora
question
for
a
connector_data_2
of
technology_3
and
last
section
of
this
for
history
it
be
popularize
by
technology_4
storm
a
a
“technology
technology_5
but
can
give
you
connector_data_3
faster”
after
which
it
be
adopt
a
a
requirement_1
technology_1
now
there
be
many
contender
why
be
connector_1
component_1
need
requirement_1
establish
the
requirement_3
of
insight
derive
from
component_1
connector_data_1
such
insight
be
not
all
create
equal
some
insight
be
more
valuable
shortly
after
it
have
happen
with
the
requirement_3
diminish
very
fast
with
time
connector_1
component_1
enable
such
scenario
provide
insight
fast
often
within
millisecond
to
second
from
the
connector_7
follow
be
some
of
the
secondary
reason
for
use
connector_1
component_1
reason
some
connector_data_1
naturally
come
a
a
never
ending
connector_1
of
to
do
pattern_2
component_1
you
need
to
component_2
it
stop
connector_data_1
collection
at
some
time
and
component_3
the
connector_data_1
then
you
have
to
do
the
next
pattern_2
and
then
worry
about
aggregate
across
multiple
pattern_2
in
contrast
connector_6
handle
neverending
connector_data_1
connector_4
gracefully
and
naturally
you
can
detect
pattern_3
inspect
connector_data_4
look
at
multiple
level
of
focus
and
also
easily
look
at
connector_data_1
from
multiple
connector_4
simultaneously
connector_1
component_1
naturally
fit
with
time
series
connector_data_1
and
detecting
pattern_3
over
time
for
example
if
you
be
try
to
detect
the
length
of
a
web
component_4
in
a
never
ending
connector_1
this
be
an
example
of
try
to
detect
a
sequence
it
be
very
hard
to
do
it
with
pattern_2
a
some
component_4
will
fall
into
two
pattern_2
connector_1
component_1
can
handle
this
easily
if
you
take
a
step
back
and
consider
the
most
continuous
connector_data_1
series
be
time
series
connector_data_1
traffic
sensor
health
sensor
transaction
requirement_4
activity
requirement_4
etc
almost
all
iot
connector_data_1
be
time
series
connector_data_1
hence
it
make
sense
to
use
a
programming
component_5
that
fit
naturally
reason
pattern_2
component_1
the
connector_data_1
build
up
and
try
to
component_1
them
at
once
while
connector_1
component_1
component_1
connector_data_1
a
they
come
in
hence
spread
the
component_1
over
time
hence
connector_1
component_1
can
work
with
a
lot
le
hardware
than
pattern_2
component_1
furthermore
connector_1
component_1
also
enable
approximate
query
component_1
via
systematic
load
shed
hence
connector_1
component_1
fit
naturally
into
use
requirement_5
where
approximate
answer
be
sufficient
reason
sometimes
connector_data_1
be
huge
and
it
be
not
even
possible
to
component_2
it
connector_1
component_1
you
handle
large
fire
horse
style
connector_data_1
and
retain
only
useful
bit
reason
finally
there
be
a
lot
of
connector_6
connector_data_1
quality_attribute_1
e
g
requirement_6
transaction
activity
visit
and
they
will
grow
fast
with
iot
use
requirement_5
all
kind
of
sensor
connector_6
be
a
much
more
natural
component_5
to
think
about
and
component_6
those
use
requirement_5
however
connector_1
component_1
be
also
not
a
technology_2
for
all
use
requirement_5
one
quality_attribute_2
rule
of
thumb
be
that
if
component_1
need
multiple
pass
through
full
connector_data_1
or
have
random
connector_8
think
a
graph
connector_data_1
set
then
it
be
tricky
with
connector_1
one
big
miss
use
requirement_5
in
connector_6
be
requirement_7
algorithm
to
train
component_5
on
the
other
hand
if
component_1
can
be
do
with
a
single
pass
over
the
connector_data_1
or
have
temporal
locality
component_1
tend
to
connector_8
recent
connector_data_1
then
it
be
a
quality_attribute_2
fit
for
connector_1
how
to
do
connector_1
component_1
if
you
want
to
build
an
component_7
that
handle
connector_6
connector_data_1
and
take
real
time
decision
you
can
either
use
a
technology_2
or
build
it
yourself
the
answer
quality_attribute_3
on
how
much
complexity
you
plan
to
handle
how
much
you
want
to
quality_attribute_4
how
much
quality_attribute_5
and
fault
tolerance
you
need
etc
if
you
want
to
build
the
component_7
yourself
place
in
a
connector_data_5
pattern_4
topic
e
g
technology_6
technology_7
or
technology_8
connector_9
to
connector_3
from
topic
in
the
pattern_4
they
become
your
connector_1
and
then
publish
connector_data_3
back
to
the
pattern_4
such
a
be
connector_5
an
actor
however
instead
of
cod
the
above
scenario
from
scratch
you
can
use
a
connector_1
component_1
technology_3
to
connector_10
time
an
connector_1
processor
you
connector_9
component_8
for
each
actor
wire
the
actor
up
and
hook
up
the
edge
to
the
connector_data_1
component_9
s
you
can
either
connector_11
directly
to
the
connector_1
processor
or
connector_11
them
via
a
pattern_4
an
connector_1
processor
will
do
the
hard
work
by
connector_12
connector_data_1
connector_13
it
to
each
actor
make
sure
they
run
in
the
right
order
connector_12
connector_data_4
quality_attribute_6
if
the
load
be
high
and
handle
failure
among
example
be
storm
flink
and
samza
if
you
to
build
the
component_7
this
way
please
connector_14
out
respective
component_10
guide
since
a
idea
connector_5
connector_6
technology_9
have
emerge
see
connector_6
technology_9
for
detail
we
connector_data_6
a
technology_10
that
enable
component_11
to
connector_9
technology_9
connector_15
to
query
connector_6
connector_data_1
a
a
“streaming
sql”
technology_10
there
be
many
connector_6
technology_9
technology_10
on
the
rise
project
such
a
technology_11
connector_1
processor
and
sqlstreams
support
technology_9
for
more
than
five
yearsapache
technology_12
support
for
connector_6
technology_9
in
2016apache
flink
support
for
connector_6
technology_9
since
2016apache
technology_8
support
for
technology_9
which
they
connector_5
ksql
in
technology_4
samza
support
for
technology_9
in
2017with
connector_6
technology_9
technology_10
developer
can
rapidly
incorporate
connector_6
connector_15
into
their
component_12
by
most
of
the
connector_1
processor
support
component_1
connector_data_1
via
a
connector_6
technology_9
technology_10
let’s
understand
how
technology_9
be
connector_data_7
to
connector_1
a
connector_1
be
a
component_13
connector_data_1
in
the
move
think
of
a
never
ending
component_13
where
connector_data_1
appear
a
the
time
go
a
connector_1
be
such
a
component_13
one
component_14
or
a
row
in
a
connector_1
be
connector_5
an
but
it
have
a
schema
and
behave
a
component_15
row
to
understand
these
idea
tyler
akidau’s
talk
at
stratum
be
a
great
resource
the
first
thing
to
understand
about
technology_9
connector_4
be
that
it
replace
component_16
with
connector_1
when
you
connector_9
technology_9
query
you
query
connector_data_1
component_2
in
a
component_15
yet
when
you
connector_9
a
connector_6
technology_9
query
you
connector_9
them
on
connector_data_1
that
be
now
a
well
a
the
connector_data_1
that
will
come
in
the
future
hence
connector_6
technology_9
connector_15
never
end
be
it
a
problem
no
it
work
because
the
output
of
those
connector_15
be
connector_1
the
will
be
place
in
output
connector_4
once
the
match
and
output
be
quality_attribute_1
right
away
a
connector_1
represent
all
that
can
come
through
a
logical
pattern_5
and
it
never
end
for
example
if
we
have
a
pattern_1
sensor
in
boiler
we
can
represent
the
output
from
the
sensor
a
a
connector_1
however
classical
technology_9
ingest
connector_data_1
component_2
in
a
component_15
component_13
component_3
them
and
connector_16
them
to
a
component_15
component_13
instead
above
query
will
ingest
a
connector_1
of
connector_data_1
a
they
come
in
and
produce
a
connector_1
of
connector_data_1
a
output
for
example
let’s
assume
there
be
in
the
boiler
connector_1
once
every
minute
the
pattern_6
query
will
produce
an
in
the
connector_data_4
connector_1
immediately
when
an
match
the
pattern_6
so
you
can
build
your
component_7
a
follow
you
connector_11
to
connector_1
processor
by
either
connector_17
directly
or
by
via
a
pattern_4
then
you
can
connector_9
the
connector_6
part
of
the
component_7
use
“streaming
sql”
finally
you
configure
the
connector_1
processor
to
act
on
the
connector_data_4
this
be
do
by
invoke
a
component_17
when
connector_1
processor
connector_18
or
by
publish
to
a
pattern_4
topic
and
listen
to
the
topic
there
be
many
connector_1
component_1
technology_3
quality_attribute_1
see
quora
question
what
be
the
best
connector_1
component_1
solution
out
there
i
would
recommend
the
one
i
have
help
build
technology_11
connector_1
processor
technology_11
sp
it
can
ingest
connector_data_1
from
technology_8
technology_13
connector_data_8
connector_data_5
pattern_4
and
you
can
query
connector_data_1
connector_1
use
a
“streaming
sql”
technology_10
technology_11
sp
be
open_source
under
technology_4
license
with
two
commodity
component_18
it
can
provide
high
quality_attribute_7
and
can
handle
100k+
tps
quality_attribute_8
it
can
quality_attribute_4
up
to
million
of
tps
on
top
of
technology_8
and
support

who
be
use
connector_1
component_1
in

connector_1
component_1
be
useful
in
use
requirement_5
where
we
can
detect

problem
and
we
have
a
reasonable

to
improve
the
outcome

history
of
connector_1
component_1
and
it
frameworksstream
component_1
have
a
long
history
start
from
active
component_15
that
provide
conditional
connector_15
on
connector_data_1
component_2
in
component_15
one
of
the
first
connector_1
component_1
technology_3
be
telegraphcq
which
be
build
on
top
of
technology_14
then
they
grow
in
two
branch
the
first
branch
be
connector_5
connector_1
component_1
these
technology_3
component_11
create
a
query
graph
connector_20
the
user’s
and
run
the
query
graph
use
many
component_23
example
be
aurora
pip
connector_1
borealis
and
yahoo
s4
these
connector_1
component_1
architecture
focus
on
quality_attribute_10
the
second
branch
be
connector_5
complex
component_1
these
technology_3
support
query
technology_10
such
a
now
we
have
with
connector_6
technology_15
and
concern
with
do
quality_attribute_11
match
of
against
give
query
but
often
run
on
1–2
technology_16
among
example
be
ode
sase
esper
cayuga
and
siddhi
these
architecture
focus
on
quality_attribute_11
connector_6
algorithm
connector_1
component_1
technology_3
from
both
these
branch
be
limit
to
academic
research
or
niche
component_24
such
a
the
requirement_9
connector_1
component_1
come
back
to
limelight
with
yahoo
s4
and
technology_4
storm
it
be
introduce
a
“like
technology_5
but
real
time”
it
become
part
of
the
requirement_1
movement
in
the
last
five
year
these
two
branch
have
merge
i
have
discus
this
in
detail
in
an
early
if
you
to
more
about
the
history
of
connector_1

recent
advancement
in
