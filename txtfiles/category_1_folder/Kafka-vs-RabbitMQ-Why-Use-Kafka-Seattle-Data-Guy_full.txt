a
vital
part
of
the
successful
completion
of
any
project
be
the
selection
of
the
right
technology_5
when
it
come
to
requirement_4
sometimes
the
difficult
choice
here
be
pick
the
right
connector_1
connector_data_1
component_2
for
example
should
you
use
technology_6
technology_1
or
technology_2
both
component_3
feature
several
requirement_5

use
requirement_6
that
can
help
component_4
make
an
inform
decision
technology_6
technology_1

technology_2
be
two
top
component_3
in
the
area
of

component_2
although
both
component_3
handle

differently
the
difference
lie
