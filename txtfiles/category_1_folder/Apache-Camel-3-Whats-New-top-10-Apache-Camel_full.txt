28th
which
also
happen
to
be
the
day
of
the
u
thanksgiving
this
be
not
intentionally
but
we
can
say
it
a
big
thanks
from
u
to
the
with
a
brand
major
version
of
technology_2
this
do
not
come
often
by
in
fact
it
year
since
technology_2
hit
the
street
so
this
3rd
generation
be
long
overdue
this
highlight
the
noteworthy
feature
and
improvement
in
technology_2
v3
technology_2
be
now
a
family

the
technology_2
base
be
very
large
and
we
have
setup
sub
project
for
innovative
project
use
technology_2
the
first
sub
project
be
to
run
technology_2
a
requirement_3
requirement_2
on
technology_4
in
a
serverless
manner
which
become
technology_2
k
then
technology_2
quarkus
come
to
make
technology_6
and
technology_2
with
very
fast
startup
and
very
small
memory
footprint
primary
for
container
base
deployment
technology_2
click
to
enlarge
a
major
goal
for
technology_2
be
to
finally
revamp
the
old
age
to
use
modern
technology_7
and
be
able
to
auto
generate
content
from
the
component_2
this
have
take
year
to
connector_3
to
this
point
a
we
have
build
technology_8
over
the
last
many
technology_2
x
release
that
could
take
u
close
at
the
end
of
then
the
technology_2
and
others
step
up
and
provide
the
art
work
logo
and
look
and
feel
for
the
thank
you
very
much
for
technology_2
x
we
will
continue
to
improve
the
and
the
documentation
this
be
much
easy
for
u
to
do
and
also
for
people
to
contribute
connector_4
a
it
a
regular
technology_9
pr
to
provide
update
we
love
contribution
zoran
have
some
fun
with
the
look
and
feel
and
he
a
little
gem
if
you
stare
at
the
front
component_3
then
you
should
see
a
little
animation
of
the
curve
bezel
technology_6
technology_2
be
the
first
official
release
that
support
technology_6
technology_6
will
still
be
support
for
the
first
number
of
x
release
but
be
expect
to
be
drop
late
in
however
we
want
to
provide
technology_6
support
to
help
migrate
technology_2
x
component_4
who
be
restrict
to
technology_6
for
some
time
to
come
modularized
technology_2
core
the
technology_2
core
have
be
modularized
from
jar
to

the
core
requirement_4
have
be

then
only
a

be
relevant
technology_2

contain
the
component_6
for
technology_2
eg
such
a
camelcontext
exchange
connector_data_1
and
so
on
technology_2
support
contain
the
base
and
routebuilder
which
you
would
use
to
build
technology_2
connector_5
and
component_7
this
jar
also
contain
necessary
base
for
build
custom
technology_2
component_8
and
other
kind
of
plugins
the
component_9
that
reside
in

component_4
can
then
pick
and
choose
exactly
only
what
they
need
or
keep
use
everything
therefore
we
have
technology_2
core
and
technology_2
core
component_5
a
two
start
connector_6
you
can
use
technology_2
core
which
give
you
all
the
jar
which
be
similar
to
technology_2
x
when
you
use
technology_2
core
component_5
you
connector_3

minimum
set
of
jar
that
make
a
functional
technology_2
technology_2
core
vs
component_5
click
to
enlarge
technology_2
core
contain
jar
and
technology_2
core
component_5
contain
jar
fast
startup
and
lower
footprint
we
have
reduce
the
size
of
core
technology_2
and
the
number
of
load
for
example
in
technology_2
about
be
load
which
have
be
reduce
to
about
load
in
technology_2
we
have
also
do
many
small
optimization
in
the
core
to
reduce
the
number
of
allocate
technology_6
connector_data_2
and
quality_attribute_2
up
initialization
and
other
mean
we
have
use
technology_5
profile
technology_8
to
assist
and
find
the
bottleneck
another
area
of
improvement
be
to
reduce
technology_6
pattern_1
in
technology_2
all
the
configuration
of
technology_2
component_8
and
connector_5
be
pattern_1
base
in
technology_2
we
have
component_2
generate
technology_6
for
a
configuration
that
allow
u
to
use
direct
technology_6
connector_data_3
instead
of
pattern_1
another
similar
area
be
camel’s
type
converter
which
in
technology_2
be
technology_6
pattern_1
base
you
could
build
custom
type
convert
that
be
not
pattern_1
base
in
technology_2
we
also
generate
technology_6
component_2
which
mean
that
type
convert
be
direct
technology_6
connector_data_3
at
runtime
we
have
also
move
initialization
component_11
to
early
phase
when
it
be
possible
for
example
there
be
a
build
phase
that
allow
technology_2
to
do
special
initialization
during
build
your
project
this
require
technology_2
quarkus
all
this
optimization
improve
the
startup
requirement_7
of
technology_2
and
reduce
the
memory
overhead
with
technology_2
quarkus
you
can
natively
compile
your
technology_2
component_7
and
make
it
startup
in
milli
second
and
connector_7
only
10mb
of
memory
r
with
a
full
blow
technology_16
pattern_2
component_12
and
health
connector_8
and
metric
technology_2
quarkus
requirement_2
compile
click
to
enlarge
there
be
still
a
few
connector_data_4
on
the
agenda
that
we
want
to
work
on
in
technology_2
x
to
further
optimize
technology_2
core
type
quality_attribute_3
dsl
technology_2
end
component_4
whom
have
configure
use
uri
would
all
have
experience
the
problem
when
you
make
a
configuration
mistake
in
the
which
then
make
technology_2
fail
on
startup
in
technology_2
we
have
a
type
quality_attribute_3
dsl
for
that
you
can
use
in
technology_6
connector_5
you
can
continue
to
use
the
classic
uri
but
if
you
want
to
try
the
dsl
then
you
need
to
technology_2
endpointdsl
to
your
classpath
then
you
should
extend
endpointroutebuilder
instead
of
routebuilder
to
connector_9
the
dsl
here
be
a
basic
example
without
and
with
the
dsl
from
timer
click
period=3000&fixedrate=true
to
seda
foo
blockwhenfull=true
from
timer
click
period
fixedrate
true
to
seda
foo
blockwhenfull
true
you
can
also
find
a
little
example
in
the
component_2
reactive
connector_10
component_5
the
connector_10
component_5
in
technology_2
have
internally
be
reactive’fied
and
all
eips
have
be
technology_17
to
work
in
a
reactive
manner
however
this
be
internal
only
and
the
technology_2
component_6
for
both
end
component_4
and
component_8
developer
be
base
on
exist
pattern_3
behavior
we
will
late
introduce
and
work
on
a
component_13
side
face
reactive
component_6
after
we
have
jump
to
technology_6
a
minimum
version
then
we
can
support
technology_6
flowable
technology_10
technology_2
already
have
requirement_1
with
reactive
technology_3
such
a
vert
x
rxjava
and
pattern_4
core
in
the
dedicate
technology_2
component_8
technology_2
we
have
introduce
technology_2
a
a
standalone
jar
that
make
it
easy
to
run
technology_2
there
be
a
couple
of
example
with
the
component_2
that
demonstrate
how
to
do
that
we
also
use
technology_2
to
have
common
to
configure
and
bootstrap
technology_2
for
standalone
technology_18
technology_2
k
and
technology_2
quarkus
this
allow
u
to
connector_1
the
same
and
configuration
option
technology_2
microprofile
technology_2
now
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_5
with
eclipse
microprofile
and
we
have
technology_2
component_9
for
microprofile
configuration
metric
health
connector_8
and
fault
tolerance
on
the
way
more
component_9
to
come
in
upcoming
technology_2
release
these
microprofile
component_9
be
also
use
by
technology_2
quarkus
miscellaneous
improvement
technology_2
now
support
junit
for
unit
test
with
the
test
component_9
that
have
junit5
a
suffix
the
technology_2
registry
be
now
also
writeable
so
you
can
component_14
to
the
registry
at
runtime
or
from
unit
test
etc
you
can
also
configure
component_15
to
a
lazy
start
by
default
technology_2
work
in
a
fail
fast
mode
which
mean
that
technology_2
component_9
that
fail
to
connector_11
to
external
component_16
during
startup
cause
the
connector_12
to
fail
on
startup
for
technology_2
you
can
now
configure
these
to
a
lazy
start
which
mean
the
connector_12
will
startup
and
they
will
first
fail
when
a
connector_data_1
be
connector_5
to
the
technology_2
also
allow
to
configure
your
connector_5
to
be
supervise
during
startup
which
allow
technology_2
to
more
intelligently
start
connector_5
in
a
more
quality_attribute_3
manner
by
restart
connector_5
that
fail
migrate
to
technology_2
we
have
of
clean
up
the
base
such
a
remove
all
deprecate
component_17
and
component_8
we
have
also
adjust
some
component_17
to
make
them
easy
to
use
from
end
component_18
and
more
technology_6
lambda
friendly
internally
we
have
also
adjust
the
connector_12
component_19
to
make
it
easy
to
extend
into
dsl
and
there
be
a
technology_19
dsl
on
the
way
which
be
initiate
in
technology_2
k
in
term
of
backward
quality_attribute_6
then
technology_2
be
mostly
quality_attribute_6
for
regular
technology_2
component_7
however
if
you
be
use
some
of
the
more
advance
feature
and
other
plugins
in
technology_2
then
migration
be
need
also
custom
component_9
must
be
migrate
and
recompiled
there
be
other
adjustment
such
a
technology_18
component_4
must
use
technology_1
technology_2
springboot
a
instead
of
technology_1
technology_2
etc
all
detail
can
be
see
in
the
migration
guide
quality_attribute_5
luck
with
your
migration
if
you
decide
to
continue
your
technology_2
journey
and
for
component_4
to
technology_2
then
