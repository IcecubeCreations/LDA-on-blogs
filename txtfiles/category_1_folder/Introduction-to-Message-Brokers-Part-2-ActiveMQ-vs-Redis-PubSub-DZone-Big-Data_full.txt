usually
prefer
this
quality_attribute_3
and

open_source
solution
the
connector_data_1
pattern_1
have
become
popular
due
to
it
quality_attribute_5
and
quality_attribute_6
with
many
technology_12
and
advance
technology_13
the
story
of
technology_1
development
at
the
begin
of
technology_1
development
there
be
two
reason
to
start
out
the
project
the
high
requirement_9
of
the
most
popular
pattern_5
technology_7
of
those
time
the
necessity
of
work
on
a
totally
j2ee

component_2
quality_attribute_6
with

s
license
unlike
it
competitor
em
technology_14
sonicmq

the

combine
quality_attribute_7

today
technology_1
capability
the
connector_data_1
orient
technology_15
provide
excellent
opportunity
for
technology_3
developer
the
component_2
be
base
on
the
technology_16
technology_17
specification
and
support
pattern_6
connector_5
so
it
allow
the
programmer
to
organize
fast
and
quality_attribute_9
pattern_5
component_3
within
requirement_11
project
i
can
define
three
key
advantage
of
the
pattern_5
component_2
quality_attribute_6
you
can
combine
technology_1
with
other
mainstream
pattern_5
technology_7
namely
quality_attribute_3
component_4
component_7
technology_4
technology_5
and
technology_6
in
addition
there
be
an
opportunity
to
use
mq
it
s
an
implementation
of
technology_9
quality_attribute_10
with
technology_18
requirement_4
solution
convenience
the
connector_data_1
pattern_1
be
base
on
the
technology_16
technology_19
a
a

the

component_9
can
also

other
than
technology_3
such
a
technology_21
technology_22
j
base
technology_23
and
technology_24
quality_attribute_11
the
pattern_5
component_2
work
fast
and
help
to
use
requirement_11
requirement_5
pattern_7
and
other
modern
solution
at
the
same
time
it
s
quite
easy
to
connector_8
and
connector_2
use
to
quality_attribute_3
configuration
of
the
connector_data_1
pattern_1
be
an
important
advantage
for
the
implementation
of

moreover

the

be

it
s
a

of

pattern_5
component_2
where
there
be
only

component_13
the
second
be
a
topic
which
be
include
in
pub
sub
pattern_5
and
imply
the
involvement
of
several
component_13
the
ability
to
use
two
type
of
pattern_5
be
also
a
great
benefit
use
a
single
connector_data_1
pattern_1
for
both
component_5
and
topic
give
the
programmer
additional
quality_attribute_11
in

this

the
