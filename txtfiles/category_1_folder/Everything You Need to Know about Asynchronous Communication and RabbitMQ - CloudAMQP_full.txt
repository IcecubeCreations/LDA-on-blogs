doesnâ€™t
require

the
advantage
be
a
high
ability

there
be

the

be
up

run
again
web
component_5
that
connector_6
a

of

be
able

connector_5
them
to

it
when

be
ready
a

this

the

remain

how
to
connector_8
pattern_1

in

pattern_1
pattern_2
in

requirement_2
be
usually
connector_8
use
connector_data_1
component_8
a
connector_data_1
pattern_4
the
basic
architecture
of
a
connector_data_1
component_8
be
quality_attribute_3
there
be
component_9
component_5
connector_9
component_10
that
create

them
to

another
component_4
connector_9
the

connector_11
to

connector_data_6
place
onto

component_8
be
component_13
until
the
component_11
connector_7
them
it
do
not
even
have
to
be
run
concurrently
when
a
connector_data_1
be
connector_13
it
be
component_12
by
the
receiver
and
then
remove
from
the
component_8
build
an
component_4
in
this
architecture
decouple
the
sender
from
the
receiver
mean
that
the
sender
and
receiver
of
the
connector_data_1
do
not
need
to
connector_14
with
the
connector_data_1
component_8
at
the
same
time
technology_1
a
a
connector_data_1
pattern_4
an
example
of
a
connector_data_1
pattern_4
be
technology_1
a
connector_data_1
pattern_4
usually
provide
feature
around
the
connector_data_3
connector_data_1
such
a
these
feature
quality_attribute_4
in
technology_1
connector_data_1
connector_15
when
connector_16
a
connector_data_1
to
a
component_8
involve
connector_16
the
connector_data_1
to
an
exchange
instead
of
straight
to
a
component_8
technology_1
exchange
be
similar
to
telephone
exchange
but
instead
of
connector_15
phone
connector_data_2
it
connector_17
connector_data_1
a
telephone
exchange
help
connector_18
the
phone
connector_data_2
to
the
correct
receiver
with
the
help
of
a
give
phone
number
in
technology_1
and
exchange
help
connector_18
the
connector_data_1
to
the
correct
component_8
with
the
help
of
attribute
locate
in
the
connector_data_1
that
different
type
of
exchange
be
use
to
reach
different
goal
and
different
connector_15
component_14
the
connector_data_1
can
be
connector_19
out
to
a
single
component_8
a
single
connector_20
or
to
many
component_15
that
pattern_5
the
connector_data_1
to
multiple
component_11
connector_data_6
can
be
exchange
in
a
technology_3
accord
to
component_6
preference
e
g
technology_4
binary
etc
one
great
approach
with
this
kind
of
setup
be
the
ability
to
pattern_5
â€“
your
component_16
do
not
really
have
it
audience
for
example
the
exchange
could
connector_5
the
connector_data_1
component_6
update
the
component_17
that
be
interest
in
such
connector_data_7
subscribe
to
these
connector_data_6
and
component_12
them
one
by
one
technology_1
provide
four
different
type
of
exchange
acknowledgement
technology_1
support
connector_data_1
acknowledgment
to
make
sure
that
a
connector_data_1
be
never
lose
an
acknowledgment
be
say
thank
you
after
you
have
connector_21
something
acknowledgment
be
connector_19
back
from
the
receiver
to
tell
the
connector_data_1
pattern_4
that
a
particular
connector_data_1
have
be
connector_21
and
that
the
connector_data_1
component_8
be
free
to
delete
the
connector_data_1
if
a
receiver
die
without
connector_16
an
acknowledgment
the
connector_data_1
component_8
will
understand
that
the
connector_data_1
wasn
t
component_12
fully
and
it
will
redeliver
the
connector_data_1
to
the
component_8
so
that
no
connector_data_1
be
lose
persistence
cluster
and
highly
quality_attribute_4
component_15
connector_data_1
component_15
and
connector_data_6
can
be
persistent
which
mean
that
connector_data_7
will
not
be
lose
in
requirement_3
of
a
restart
a
connector_data_1
component_8
in
technology_1
provide
connector_data_6
a
quality_attribute_5
place
to
live
until
they
be
connector_6
several
technology_1
component_18
can
be
cluster
together
to
form
a
single
connector_data_1
pattern_4
component_15
can
be
mirror
across
several
component_19
in
a
cluster
ensure
that
even
in
the
of
hardware
failure
the
connector_data_6
be
quality_attribute_5
requirement_4
ui
trace
and
plugins
technology_1
requirement_4
be
a
component_6
friendly
that
allow
for
pattern_6
and
handle
connector_data_4
in
the
technology_1
component_20
among
other
thing
component_8
connector_22
exchange
component_21
and
component_6
permission
can
be
handle
create

and
connector_data_8
through
the

connector_data_1

can
also
be
pattern_7
a
well
a
connector_16

connector_23
connector_data_6
manually
technology_1
offer
