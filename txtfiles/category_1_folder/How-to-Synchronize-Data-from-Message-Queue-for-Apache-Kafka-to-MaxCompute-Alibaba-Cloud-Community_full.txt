background


objective
for
daily

many
requirement_4
use
connector_data_2
component_1
for
technology_1
technology_2
to
connector_1
the
behavior
requirement_2
and
requirement_5
connector_data_1
generate
by
component_3
or

and
then
component_4
them
offline
or
in
real
time
generally
the
requirement_2
and
connector_data_1
be
connector_2
to
maxcompute
for
component_5
and
requirement_5
component_4
to
obtain
component_6
feature
sale
rank
and
regional
order
distribution
and
the
connector_data_1
be
display
in
connector_data_1
report


solution
there
be
two
way
to
synchronize
connector_data_1
from
connector_data_2
component_1
for
technology_1
technology_2
to
dataworks
in
one
component_4
requirement_5
connector_data_1
and
behavior
requirement_2
be
connector_3
to
datahub
through
connector_data_2
component_1
for
technology_1
technology_2
and
technology_3
then
transfer
to
maxcompute
and
finally
display
in
quick
pattern_1
in
the
second
component_4
requirement_5
connector_data_1
and
action
requirement_2
be
transfer
through
connector_data_2
component_1
for
technology_1
technology_2
dataworks
and
maxcompute
and
finally
display
in
quick
pattern_1
in
the
follow
description
i
will
use
the
second
component_4
synchronize
connector_data_1
from
dataworks
to
maxcompute
use
one
of
two
solution
custom

group
custom
resource
group
be
use
to
migrate
connector_data_1
to
the

be
use
when
