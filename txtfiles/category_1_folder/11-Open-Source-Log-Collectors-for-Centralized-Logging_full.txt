two
type
level
of

component_7
be
deterministic
component_8
except
when
they‚Äôre
not

i‚Äôve
come
across
many
requirement_6
where
the
observe
behavior
of
the

baffle
everyone
for
day
on
end
but
the
key
be
always
in
the
requirement_1
every
piece
of

run
produce
or
at

should
generate
requirement_1
which
tell
u
what
it

go
through
when
the
problematic
situation
occur
now
requirement_1
a
i
see
it
be
of
two
type
auto
generate
requirement_1
and
programmer
generate
requirement_1
please
note
that
this
isn‚Äôt
any
textbook
differentiation
and
quote
me
on
this

will
land
you
in

üòâ
the
image
above
show
what
can
be
term
a
an
auto
generate

in
this
specific
requirement_6
it‚Äôs
a
technology_2
component_8
requirement_1
an
unexpected
condition
a
notice
when
run
some
technology_4

requirement_1
these
be

generate
all

tirelessly
‚Äî
by

technology_1
technology_5
web
component_10
technology_6
programming
technology_7
and
environment
requirement_7
component_11
and
even
operate
component_8
these
rarely
contain
much
requirement_8
and
programmer
don‚Äôt
even
bother
to
look
into
them
except
when
something
go
wrong
at
such
moment
they
dig
deep
into
the
requirement_1
try
to
understand
what
go
wrong
but
auto
generate
requirement_1
can
help
only
so
much
if
several
people
have
admin
connector_6
to
a

for
example
and
one
of
them
happen
to
delete
an
essential
piece
of
connector_data_1
it‚Äôs
impossible
to
detect
the
culprit
with
the
use
of
auto
generate
requirement_1
from
the
perspective
of
the
component_12
tie
together
a
the
component_4
it
be
another
day
in
the
‚Äî
someone
have
the
need
authority
to
connector_7
a
connector_data_2
and
so
the
component_8
carry
it
out
what‚Äôs
need
here
be
an
additional
pattern_2
of
explicit
extensive
requirement_1
that
create
trail
for
the
human
side
of
thing
these
be
what
i
term
a
programmer
generate
requirement_1
and
they
form
the
technology_8
of
sensitive
requirement_9
bank
here‚Äôs
an
example
of
what
such
a
requirement_1
technology_9
might
look

component_13
joomlatools
technology_10
requirement_1
be
power
so
give
these
two
type
of
requirement_1
in
a
component_8
here‚Äôs
how
you
can
leverage
them
and
ramp
up
the
impact
stay
ahead
of
the
requirement_5
‚Äúcustomer
delight‚Äù
have
come
to
be

a
a
useless
requirement_4
gimmick
but
thanks
to
requirement_1
it
can
be
make
very
real
i
of
digital
technology_3
that
pattern_3
their
requirement_1
a
hawk
and
a
soon
a
a
requirement_5
break
something
on
the
component_14
they
can
connector_data_3
the
requirement_5
and
offer
to
help
think
about
it
‚Äî
within
second
of
connector_8
an
ugly
error
you
connector_5
a
connector_data_3
from
the
requirement_10
that
say
‚Äúhey
i
understand
you
be
try

this

it

to

complete
the

‚Äù

requirement_5
you

i

before

bug
go

the
developer
in
your
team
connector_5
frustrate
and
lose
more
and
more
time
chase
their
tail
and
here‚Äôs
the
thing
with
debug
‚Äî
it
require
a
fresh
curious
mind
from
the
start
if
a
wtf
think
so
much
a
enter
your
brain
the
whole
component_15
go
for
a
toss
and
what
make
debug
hard
in
my
experience
lack
of
requirement_1
or
the
lack
of
knowledge
of
requirement_1
for
starter
you
not
realize
that
your
favorite
component_3
be
also
another
piece
of
that
generate
requirement_1
or
you
not
be
requirement_1
extensively
in
your
component_4
see
programmer
generate
requirement_1
above
i
particularly
remember
a
requirement_6
where
the
component_4
be
go
unresponsive
and
no
one

why
a
few
day
late
the
culprit
be
the
disk
i
o
limit
reach
due
to
excessive
traffic
because
no
one
bother
to
look
there
no
one
could
figure
out
why
audit
trail
what
if
two
year
down
the
line
your
requirement_5
say
that
all
those
order
weren‚Äôt
place
by
them
but
by
some
hacker
what
argument
would
have
to
entertain
or
reject
their
connector_data_4
if
you
have
extensive
requirement_1
ip
connector_9
date
and
time
credit
card
etc
then
you‚Äôll
be
able
to
analyze
all
that
and
reach
a
decision
quality_attribute_3
or
bad
it
will
at
least
have
some
objective
basis
rather
than
resemble
a
shoot
in
the
dark
component_13
signature
connector_10
technology_10
the
same
be
true
if
you
come
under
some
regulatory
lens
or
be
require
to
undergo
a
third
party
audit
a
part
of
a

important
project
not
have
a
quality_attribute_4
requirement_1
component_8
will
show
you
in
a
bad
light
improve
exist
component_12
how
do
you
go
about
improve
the
current
component_8
should
you
merely
throw
more
ram
and
cpu
component_16
at
it
what
if
your
component_9
be
slow
despite
enough
resource
where
be
the
bottleneck
more
often
than
not
requirement_1
be
the
answer
for
instance
all
major
component_3
component_12
have
a
feature
for
requirement_1
slow
query
component_13
speedawarenessmonth
technology_10
if
you
visit
the
slow
query
requirement_1
regularly
you‚Äôll
connector_5
to
which
and
take
the
most
time
and
hence
uncover
small
but
important
area
that
need
work
often
a
small
connector_11
this
work
quality_attribute_3
than
double
the
hardware
capacity
there‚Äôs
no
count
how
many
way
a
quality_attribute_3
requirement_1
component_8
help
you
perhaps
the
best
argument
be
that
it‚Äôs
an
automate
activity
that
once
set
up
doesn‚Äôt
need
any
pattern_3
and
will
connector_12
you
from
ruin
someday
with
that
out
of
the
way
let‚Äôs
look
at
some
of
the
amaze
open_source
requirement_1
collector
unify
requirement_1
technology_1
out
there
in
requirement_6
you‚Äôre
wonder
we
do
cover
commercial
requirement_2
base
requirement_1
technology_1
in
an
early

graylog
graylog
be
one
of
the
lead
name
in
the
requirement_9
when
it
come
to
requirement_9
grade
requirement_1
and
visualization
capability
it‚Äôs
also
unique
in
that
it
scan
your
connector_13
requirement_1
for
sign
of
quality_attribute_1
vulnerability
and
connector_14
you
instantly
while
graylog
be

it

the
quality_attribute_5
you
need

you
customize

requirement_11

more
greylog

there‚Äôs
an

if

cisco
and
linkedin
on

graylog
be

trust
with
your

close
logstash
if
you‚Äôre
a
fan
or
component_18
of
the

logstash
be

connector_15
out
the

be
already
a

in

you
didn‚Äôt

other
requirement_1
technology_1
on
this
connector_data_5
logstash
if
fully
open
component_13
allow
you
the
freedom
to
quality_attribute_6
and
use
a
you
wish
but
don‚Äôt
be
mislead
logstash
be
a
mothership
with
capability
far
outweigh
any
humble
requirement_1
technology_1
it‚Äôs
able
to
connector_13
vast
amount
of
connector_data_6
from
multiple
component_19
allow
you
to
define
and
connector_7
your
own
connector_data_6
pipeline
make
sense
of
pattern_4
requirement_1
connector_data_7
and
more
of

the
only
limitation
be
that
it
work
with
the
elastic
suite
of
technology_3
only
but
if
you‚Äôre
start
and
look
to
quality_attribute_7
soon
logstash
be
the
way
to
go
fluentd
among
centralized
requirement_1
technology_1
that
work
a

for

flutend
be

with

atlassian

use
the

fluentd
have
nothing
to
prove
üôÇ
technology_17
if
really
really
large
connector_data_6
set
be
your
challenge
and
you
eventually
want
to

everything
into
something
technology_18
technology_17
be

of
the
best
choice
around
it‚Äôs
a
‚Äúpure‚Äù
open_source
project
in
the
sense
that
it‚Äôs
maintain
by
our
beloved

foundation
which
mean
there

you‚Äôre
exactly
look

üôÇ
component_13

which
continue
to
astonish
me
when
it

tech
flume‚Äôs
component_13
be

technology_17
be

for

if
you‚Äôre
look

component_19
for
heavy
duty
stuff
octopussy
i
give
it
zero
out
of
ten
for
technology_3
name
but
octopussy
can
be
a
quality_attribute_3
choice
if
your
need
be
quality_attribute_10
and
you‚Äôre
wonder
about
what
all
the
fuss
relate
to
pipeline
ingestion
aggregation
etc
be
all
about
in
my
opinion
octopussy
cover
the
need
of
most
of
the
technology_3
out
there
estimate

be
useless
but
if
i
have
to
guess
i‚Äôd
say
it
take
care
of
80%
of
use
requirement_6
in
the
real
world
octopussy
doesn‚Äôt
have
a
great
ui
see
here
at

it
make
up
for
it
regard
quality_attribute_11
and
lack
of

the

be
quality_attribute_12
on

also
provide

it

logalyze
be

and
produce

yes
it

do

since

how

it‚Äôs
for
those
who
have
their
requirement_1
unify
into
a

or
want
to
pattern_7
and
display
real

if
you

lnav
be
nothing
more

there
you
