the
unsung
hero
of

analysis
be
the

they
be
the

make
it
all

here
we
will
pit
the
two
of
the
most
popular
connector_data_1
collector
in
the
open_source
world
fluentd
vs

logstash
be
most
for

part
of
the
elk
technology_1
while
fluentd
have
become
increasingly
use
by
of
component_8
of
such
a
technology_6
gcp
and
elasticsearch
the
goal
here
be
a
no
frill
comparison
and
matchup
of
elastic’s
logstash
vs
fluentd
which
be
owned
by
treasure
connector_data_1
the
goal
be
to
connector_4
all
of
the
fact
about
these
excellent
component_9
in
one
place
so
that
reader
can
make

we
see
a
grow
number
of

use

a

it
be
important
for
u
to
make
this
comparison
the
follow
requirement_10
of
the
difference
between
logstash
and
fluentd
and
then
we
go
into
more
detail
below
fluentd
vs
logstash
component_1
comparisonone
of
logstash’s
original
advantage
be
that
it
be
connector_5
in
technology_8
and
hence
it
run
on
window
fluentd
on
the
other
hand
do
not
support
window
until
recently
due
to
it
connector_6

not
anymore
a
of
this

of
the
key

of

both

their
approach
be
different

all
connector_data_1
into
a
single
connector_8
and
then
u
algorithmic

then
statement

connector_9
them
to
the
right
destination
here
be
an
example
that
connector_10
error
in
production
to
pagerduty
output
{
if
loglevel
==
error
and
deployment
==
production
{

{
}
}
}vs
fluentd
routingfluentd
rely
on
tag
to
connector_11
each
fluentd
have
a
tag
that
tell
fluentd
where
it
want
to
be
connector_7
for
example
if
you
be
connector_12
error
in
production
to
pagerduty
the
configuration
would
look
something
this
match

that
hold

and
rely
on
an
external
component_19
technology_15
for

across

this
be
a
issue
for
logstash
and
it
be
actively
work
on
this
issue
where
they
aim
to
persist
the
component_19
on
disk
fluentd
on
the
other
hand
have
a
highly
easy

configure

component_13
it
can
be
either
in

or
on

with

that
you
ever
care

the
upside
of
logstash’s
approach
be
quality_attribute_5
the
mental
component_20
for

size
component_19
be
very
quality_attribute_6
however
you
must

fluentd
have
build

complicatedperformance
comparisonthis
be
a
nebulous
topic
a
discus
in
this
talk
at
technology_16
summit
both
perform
well
in
most
use
requirement_6
and
consistently
grok
through
000+
per
second
that
say
logstash
be
to
connector_15
more
memory
at
around
120mb
compare
to
fluentd’s
40mb
consider
modern
component_21
this
isn’t
a
big
difference
between
the
two
aggregator
for
leaf
component_21
it’s
a
different
story
technology_17
across
component_6
this
can
mean
80gb
of
additional
memory
use
which
be
significant
this
hypothetical
number
come
from
the
80mb
difference
between
logstash
and
fluentd
on
a
single
component_21
multiply
by
component_21
don’t
worry
logstash
have
a
solution
instead
of
run
the
fully
feature
logstash
on
leaf
technology_18
elastic
recommend
that
you
run

for
the
feedback
–
this

update
asap
cameron
kerr
say
at
pmi
feel
this
really
miss
out
on
some
significant
aspect
it
should
compare
ability
to
component_15
and
enrich
requirement_1
not
connector_11
them
while
perhaps
not
quite
so
much
an
issue
for
requirement_1
component_23
with
the
exception
of
multiline
requirement_1
which
often
connector_18
tricky
when
quality_attribute_11
out
the
reception
pattern_5
this
be
where
a
lot
of
requirement_12
connector_18
inject
i’ve
find
it
useful
to
break
down
requirement_13
into
reception
and
enrichment
pattern_5
on
the
requirement_1
component_6
similarly
leaf
technology_18
and
component_6
technology_18
be
very
different
and
i
felt
this
could
have
say
a
lot
more
about
the
architectural
philosophical
approach
of
each
for
example
filebeat
the
beat
for
connector_12
requirement_1
to
logstash
or
elasticsearch
doesn’t
really
offer
much
if
any
pattern_3
i
would
have
to
see
the
extent
to
which
fluent
bit
or
fluent
connector_13
offer
to
reduce
the
amount
of
requirement_1
traffic
be
connector_19
centrally
thanks
for
the
though
it
do
give
me
some
introduction
to
fluentd
john
knepper
say
at
pmi
think
this
be
outdated
so
i’ll
that
most
modern
architecture
be
ship
to
logstash
a
a
centralized
requirement_1
agent
but
connector_20
ship
with
filebeat
don’t
use
logstash
connector_13
it’s
old
and
deprecate
filebeat
work
very
well
especially
under
heavy
load
and
can
even
ship
directly
to

if
you
don’t
