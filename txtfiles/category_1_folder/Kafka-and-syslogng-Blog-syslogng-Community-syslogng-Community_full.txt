i
tweet
about
syslog
ng‘s
technology_1
destination
i
gather
some
follower
most
of
the
time
they
be
more
interest
in
another
technology_1
who
be
bear
in
prague
by
the
end
of
the
19th
century
and
connector_2
excellent
surreal
short
story
even
if
i
admire
kafka’s
work
i’ll
connector_2
here
a
usual
about
syslog
ng
and
one
of
it
most
recent
destination
the
technology_1
destination
technology_1
introduction
first
of
all
me
introduce
technology_1
a
high
quality_attribute_2
quality_attribute_3
pattern_2
component_4
it
be
originally
develop
by
linkedin
a
a
technology_4
of
a
activity
track
infrastructure
once
open_source
it
be
develop
further
under
the
umbrella
of
the
technology_5
foundation
in
confluent
be
find
to
provide
requirement_5
level
support
to
technology_1
component_3
technology_1
be
now
use
by
major
requirement_6
include
netflix
twitter
and
paypal
there
be
now
many
more
u
for
technology_1
connector_data_3
component_5
requirement_1
aggregation
connector_3
component_6
or
a
a
connector_4
requirement_1
there
be
four
important
term
to
if
you
want
to
understand
the
basic
of
technology_1
and
where
syslog
ng
fit
into
the
picture
for
a
more
detail
introduction
connector_5
the
technology_1
documentation
topic
be
the
category
where
technology_1
fee
connector_data_3
component_7
publish
connector_data_4
to
a
technology_1
topic
component_8
subscribe
to
topic
to
component_6
the
publish
connector_data_4
technology_1
itself
be
a
cluster
of
one
or
more
component_9
that
be
connector_6
pattern_3
the
syslog
ng
component_10
can
act
a
a
component_11
and
publish
connector_data_4
to
a
technology_1
topic
but
it
be
not
a
quality_attribute_4
collection
of
syslog
connector_data_4
and
publish
them
to
technology_1
the
syslog
ng
component_10
can
connector_7
connector_data_4
from
several
component_12
and
component_6
a
well
a
pattern_4
them
before
connector_8
them
to
technology_1
this
can
simplify
the
architecture
lessen
the
load
on
pattern_3
due
to
pattern_4
and
ease
the
work
of
component_8
a
they
connector_9
pre
component_6
connector_data_3
connector_data_1
collector
base
on
the
name
of
syslog
ng
most
people
consider
it
a
an
component_10
for
connector_10
syslog
connector_data_3
and
that
be
partially
right
syslog
ng
can
connector_7
syslog
connector_data_4
from
a
large
number
of
component_13
specific
component_12
dev
requirement_1
journal
sun
connector_3
and
so
on
but
syslog
ng
can
also
connector_11
run
component_14
and
connector_7
their
technology_6
output
connector_11
connector_data_4
from
technology_7
and
pip
or
connector_9
connector_data_4
over
the
requirement_7
there
be
no
need
for
a
separate
script
or
component_10
to
accomplish
these
connector_data_5
syslog
ng
can
be
use
a
a
generic
connector_data_1
collector
that
can
greatly
simplify
the
connector_data_1
pipeline
there
be
a
considerable
number
of
component_15
that
emit
a
high
number
of
syslog
connector_data_4
to
the
requirement_7
but
cannot
component_1
them
pattern_5
firewall
requirement_7
appliance
the
syslog
ng
component_10
can
connector_7
these
connector_data_3
even
at
high
connector_data_3
rat
no
matter
if
it
be
connector_12
use
the
component_16
or
rfc5424
syslog
technology_8
over
technology_9
technology_10
or
tl
this
mean
that
component_10
requirement_1
can
be
enrich
with
syslog
and
requirement_7
component_17
requirement_1
and
provide
valuable
component_18
for
team
and
all
of
these
provide
by
a
single
component_10
syslog
ng
connector_data_1
processor
there
be
several
way
to
component_6
connector_data_1
in
syslog
ng
first
of
all
connector_data_1
be
requirement_8
by
default
it
be
one
of
the
syslog
requirement_9
either
the
component_16
or
the
rfc5424
but
it
can
either
be
replace
by
others
or
the
connector_data_3
content
can
further
be
requirement_8
columnar
connector_data_1
can
be
requirement_8
with
the
csv
requirement_9
free
form
connector_data_4
–
most
syslog
connector_data_4
–
with
the
patterndb
requirement_9
and
there
be
requirement_9
for
technology_11
connector_data_1
and
key
requirement_10
pair
a
well
connector_data_4
can
be
rewrite
for
example
by
overwrite
credit
card
number
or
component_3
name
due
to
compliance
or
privacy
regulation
connector_data_1
can
also
be
enrich
in
multiple
way
the
patterndb
requirement_9
can
create
additional
name
requirement_10
pair
base
on
connector_data_3
content
the
geoip
requirement_9
can
geographical
location
base
on
the
ip
connector_13
contain
in
the
requirement_1
connector_data_3
it
be
also
possible
to
completely
reformat
connector_data_4
use
template
base
on
the
requirement
of
the
need
of
the
component_19
why
connector_14
all
from
a
web
component_20
requirement_1
if
only
a
third
of
them
be
use
on
the
component_6
end
connector_data_1
pattern_4
unless
you
really
want
to
connector_15
all
connector_7
connector_data_1
you
will
use
one
or
more
pattern_4
in
syslog
ng
there
be
several
pattern_4
both
for
connector_data_3
content
and
connector_data_3
parameter
component_10
name
or
connector_data_3
priority
all
of
these
can
be
freely
combine
use
boolean
operator
make
very
complex
pattern_4
possible
the
use
of
pattern_4
have
two
major
u
only
relevant
connector_data_4
connector_16
through
the
rest
can
be
discard
connector_data_4
can
be
connector_17
to
the
right
destination
either
of
these
can
lessen
the
resource
usage
and
therefore
the
load
a
well
on
both
the
pattern_3
and
component_19
once
connector_data_1
be
connector_7
component_6
and
pattern_4
it
be
time
to
connector_15
it
to
a
technology_1
destination
this
destination
be
a
brand
feature
in
syslog
ng
while
most
of
syslog
ng
be
connector_2
in
technology_12
and
be
extremely
resource
quality_attribute_5
even
if
all
of
the
above
feature
be
in
heavy
use
the
technology_1
destination
be
connector_2
in
technology_13
it
be
not
so
light
on
resource
usage
but
use
technology_13
have
the
advantage
that
the
official
technology_1
component_21
technology_14
can
be
utilize
the
technology_1
destination
be
quality_attribute_6
in
both
syslog
ng
open_source
edition
ose
and
in
the
commercially
support
premium
edition
pe
connector_18
start
with
it
take
a
bit
more
configuration
work
than
with
other
non
technology_13
base
destination
but
it
be
worth
the
effort
for
pe
everything
be
include
in
the
documentation
publish
connector_data_4
to
technology_5
technology_1
schaeferkkf25
month
ago
for
me
there
be
no
need
for
a
separate
script
or
component_10
to
accomplish
these
connector_data_5
syslog
ng
can
be
use
a
a
generic
connector_data_1
collector
that
can
greatly
simplify
the
connector_data_1
pipeline
