for

connector_data_1
internet
of
thing
iot
requirement_2
component_2
and
various
other
modern
component_3
be
become
an
inevitable
reality
today
people
from
all
walk
of
life
have
start
to
connector_1
with
connector_data_1
storage
and
component_4
a
a
part
of
their
daily
routine
therefore
we
can
say
that
deal
with
requirement_1
in
the
best
possible
manner
be
become
the
area
of
interest
for
requirement_3
scientist
and
individual
for
instance
an
component_5
launch
for
achieve
certain
requirement_3
goal
will
be
more
successful
if
it
can
efficiently
handle
the
connector_2
make
by
requirement_4
and
serve
their
purpose
well
such
component_6
need
to
connector_1
with
connector_data_1
storage
and
in
this
we’ll
try
to
explore
two
important
connector_data_1
component_1
architecture
that
serve
a
the
technology_2
of
various
requirement_5
component_6

a
lambda
and
kappa
the
rapid
growth
of
social

component_5
requirement_6
component_7
internet
of
thing
and
an
unending
technology_3
of
innovation
have
make
it
important
for
a
developer
or
a
connector_data_1
scientist
to
take
well
calculate
decision
while
launch
upgrade
or
troubleshoot
an
requirement_5
component_5
although
it
have
be
widely
connector_3
and
understand
that
use
a
modular
approach
to
build
an
component_5
have
multiple
advantage
and
long
term
benefit
the
pursuit
for
select
the
right
connector_data_1
component_1
architecture
still
keep
put
question
mark
in
front
of
many
proposal
relate
to
exist
and
upcoming
requirement_5

although
there
be
various
connector_data_1
component_1
architecture
be
follow
around
the
globe
these
day
let’s
investigate
the
lambda
and
kappa
architecture
in
detail
and
find
out
what
make
each
of
them
special
and
in
what
circumstance
one
should
be
prefer
over
another
lambda
architecturelambda
architecture
be
a
connector_data_1
component_1
technique
that
be
capable
of
deal
with
huge
amount
of
connector_data_1
in
an
quality_attribute_1
manner
the
quality_attribute_2
of
this
architecture
become
evident
in
the
form
of
increase
quality_attribute_3
reduce
quality_attribute_4
and
negligible
error
while
we
mention
connector_data_1
component_1
we
basically
use
this
term
to
represent
high
quality_attribute_3
low
quality_attribute_4
and
aim
for
near
real
time
component_5
which
also
would
allow
the
developer
to
define
delta
rule
in
the
form
of
component_8
or
natural
technology_4
component_1
nlp
in
pattern_1
connector_data_1
component_1
component_2
to
achieve
quality_attribute_5
automation
and
quality_attribute_2
and
improve
the
connector_data_1
quality
moreover
any
connector_4
in
the
state
of
connector_data_1
be
an
to
the
component_7
and
a
a
matter
of
fact
it
be
possible
to
give
a
command
query
or
expect
to
carry
out
delta

a
connector_5

a
concept
of
use
the
to
make
prediction

well
a
connector_6

connector_7
in
a

on
the
real
time
basis
a
connector_4
of
state
of
a
component_7
an
update
in
the
component_10
or
an
can
be
understand
a
a
connector_4
for
instance
if
someone
connector_1
with
a
web
component_11
or
a
social
requirement_7
profile
the
component_11
pattern_2

or
a
a
friend
connector_data_2
etc…
be
connector_8
that
can
be
component_1
or
enrich
and
the
connector_data_1
component_12
in
a
component_10
connector_data_1
component_1
deal
with
the
connector_9
and
most
of
the
requirement_5
that
follow
the
domain

use
the
connector_10

to
predict

here
be
a
basic
diagram
of
what
lambda

would
look

lambda

pattern_5
that
to
a
functional
equation
which
define
any
query
in

domain
the
symbol
use
in
this
equation
be

a
lambda
and
the
name
for
the
lambda

be
also
coin

mean
that

can
be

in
the

by
combine
the
connector_data_5
from

he
point
out
some

conclusionin
short
the
choice
between

manner
you
should
use
the
lambda
architecture
a
it
reap
the
benefit
of
pattern_4
pattern_3
and
quality_attribute_6
pattern_3
to
ensure
le

and
quality_attribute_6
on
the
other
hand
if
you
want
to
quality_attribute_7

by
use
le
expensive
hardware
and
require
it
to

effectively
