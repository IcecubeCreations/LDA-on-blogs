sometimes
it
be
not
two
but
it
take
three
to
tango
you
must
have
hear
of
a
lot
of
friendship
story
and
i
bet
many
of
them
must
be
tale
of
three
wonder
why
be
we
talk
about
friendship
here
well
that
be
because
this
will
be
talk
about
a
trio
whose
friendship
make
the
movement
of
connector_data_1
possible
in
this

we
will
focus
on
extract
transform
load
technology_1
which
refer
to
a
trio
of
component_17
require
to
move
raw
connector_data_1
from
it
component_18
to
a
connector_data_1
requirement_17
or
a
component_6
what
be
technology_1
while
work
with
component_6
it
be
essential
to
properly
technology_54
and
prepare
connector_data_1
in
order
to
load
it
into
connector_data_1
storage
component_7
technology_1
be
three
separate
but
crucial
combine
into
a
single
programming
technology_2
that
help
in
prepare
connector_data_1
and
in
the
requirement_1
of
component_6
extract

each
denote
a
component_9
in
the
movement
of
connector_data_1
from
it
component_18
to

component_7
often
refer
to
a
a
connector_data_1
requirement_17
extract
the
extract
connector_8
connector_data_1
from
a
component_18
component_6
and
extract
the
desire
subset
of
connector_data_1
the
purpose
of
this
step
be
to
connector_9
all
the
require
connector_data_1
from
the
component_18
component_7
with
minimum
resource
this
step
need
to
be
design
in
a
way
that
it
do
not
affect
the
component_18
component_7
negatively
in
term
of
requirement_11
or
response_time
transform
this
pattern_2
cleanse
and
prepare
the

or
rule
or
by
create
combination
with
other
connector_data_1
and
convert
it
to
the
desire
state
the
transform
step
include
validation
of
component_20
rejection
of
connector_data_1
if
they
be
not
acceptable
and
connector_data_1
requirement_8
the
commonly
use

for

clear
the
duplicate
standardize
pattern_4
and
look
up
or
verify
the
consistency
of

the

be
the
last
stage
of
an
technology_1
component_9
the
load
connector_10
the
connector_data_3
connector_data_1
i
e
the

of
the

many
other

the

for
each
component_20
from
the
component_18
why
do
we
need
technology_1
technology_2
this
look
a
typical
question
that
be
ask
to
a
candidate
but
on
a
serious
note
a
connector_data_1
requirement_17
technology_2
contain
connector_data_1
from

component_22
which
be
bring
together
in
one
place
to
be
analyze
for
meaningful
pattern_6
and
insight
technology_1
component_17
the
heterogeneous
connector_data_1
and
make
it
homogeneous
which
in
turn
make
it
seamless
for
connector_data_1
scientist
and
connector_data_1
analyst
to
analyze
the
connector_data_1
and
derive
requirement_7
intelligence
from
it
technology_1
be
much
easy
and
fast
to
use
when
compare
to
the
traditional

what
be
the
benefit
of
technology_1
technology_2
by
now
we
already
that
it
be

in
this

we
will
discus
some
of
the
key
advantage
of

ease
of

the
first
and
foremost
advantage
of
