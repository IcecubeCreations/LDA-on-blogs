@rabbitmqmay
2012you
have
a
component_1
in
rabbit
you
have
some
component_2
connector_1
from
that
component_1
if
you
don’t
set
a
qos
set
at
all
basic
qos
then
rabbit
will
connector_2
all
the
queue’s
connector_data_1
to
the
component_2
a
fast
a
the
requirement_2
and
the
component_2
will
allow
the
component_3
will
balloon
in
memory
a
they
buffer
all
the
connector_data_1
in
their
own
ram
the
component_1
appear
empty
if
you
ask
rabbit
but
there
be
million
of
connector_data_1
unacknowledged
a
they
sit
in
the
component_4
ready
for
component_5
by
the
component_4
component_6
if
you
a
component_7
there
be
no
connector_data_1
leave
in
the
component_1
to
be
connector_3
to
the
component_7
connector_data_1
be
be
buffer
in
the
exist
component_4
and
be
there
for
a
long
time
even
if
there
be
other
component_3
that
become
quality_attribute_3
to
component_5
such
connector_data_1
sooner
this
be
rather
sub
optimal
so
the
default
qos
prefetch
set
give
component_2
an
unlimited
buffer
and
that
can
connector_data_2
in
poor
behaviour
and
requirement_1
but
what
should
you
set
the
qos
prefetch
buffer
size
to
the
goal
be
to
keep
the
component_3
saturated
with
work
but
to
minimise
the
client’s
buffer
size
so
that
more
connector_data_1
stay
in
rabbit’s
component_1
and
be
thus
quality_attribute_3
for
component_3
or
to
be
connector_3
out
to
component_3
a
they
become
free
let’s
say
it
take
50ms
for
rabbit
to
take
a
connector_data_3
from
this
component_1
put
it
on
the
requirement_2
and
for
it
to
arrive
at
the
component_7
it
take
4ms
for
the
component_4
to
component_5
the
connector_data_3
once
the
component_7
have
component_5
the
connector_data_3
it
connector_4
an
ack
back
to
rabbit
which
take
a
further
50ms
to
be
connector_3
to
and
component_5
by
rabbit
so
we
have
a
total
round
trip
time
of
104ms
if
we
have
a
qos
prefetch
set
of
connector_data_3
then
rabbit
won’t
connector_3
out
the
next
connector_data_3
until
after
this
round
trip
complete
thus
the
component_4
will
be
busy
for
only
4ms
of
every
104ms
or
8%
of
the
time
we
want
it
to
be
busy
100%
of
the
time
if
we
do
total
round
trip
time
component_5
time
on
the
component_4
for
each
connector_data_3
we
connector_5
=
if
we
have
a
qos
prefetch
of
connector_data_1
this
solve
our
problem
assume
that
the
component_4
have
connector_data_1
buffer
ready
and
wait
for
component_5
this
be
a
sensible
assumption
once
you
set
basic
qos
and
then
connector_6
from
a
component_1
rabbit
will
connector_7
a
many
connector_data_1
a
it
can
from
the
component_1
you’ve
subscribe
to
to
the
component_4
up
to
the
qos
limit
if
you
assume
connector_data_1
aren’t
very
big
and
bandwidth
be
high
it’s
likely
rabbit
will
be
able
to
connector_7
connector_data_1
to
your
connector_1
component_4
fast
than
your
component_4
can
component_5
them
thus
it’s
reasonable
and
quality_attribute_4
to
do
all
the
math
from
the
assumption
of
a
full
component_4
side
buffer
if
each
connector_data_3
take
4ms
of
component_5
to
deal
with
then
it’ll
take
a
total
of
*
=
104ms
to
deal
with
the
entire
buffer
the
first
4ms
be
the
component_4
component_5
of
the
first
connector_data_3
the
component_4
then
issue
an
ack
and
go
on
to
component_5
the
next
connector_data_3
from
the
buffer
that
ack
take
50ms
to
connector_5
to
the
pattern_2
the
pattern_2
than
issue
a
connector_data_3
to
the
component_4
which
take
50ms
to
connector_5
there
so
by
the
time
104ms
have
pass
and
the
component_4
have
finish
component_5
it
buffer
the
next
connector_data_3
from
the
pattern_2
have
already
arrive
and
be
ready
and
wait
for
the
component_4
to
component_5
it
thus
the
component_4
remain
busy
all
the
time
have
a
big
qos
prefetch
will
not
make
it
go
fast
but
we
minimise
the
buffer
size
and
thus
quality_attribute_2
of
connector_data_1
in
the
component_4
connector_data_1
be
buffer
by
the
component_4
for
no
long
than
they
need
to
be
in
order
to
keep
the
component_4
saturated
with
work
in
fact
the
component_4
be
able
to
fully
drain
the
buffer
before
the
next
connector_data_3
arrive
thus
the
buffer
actually
stay
empty
this
solution
be
fine
provide
component_5
time
and
requirement_2
behaviour
remain
the
same
but
consider
what
happen
if
suddenly
the
requirement_2
half
in
quality_attribute_5
your
prefetch
buffer
be
no
long
big
enough
and
now
the
component_4
will
sit
idle
wait
for
connector_data_1
to
arrive
a
the
component_4
be
able
to
component_5
connector_data_1
fast
than
rabbit
can
supply
fresh
connector_data_3
to
connector_8
this
problem
we
might
decide
to
double
or
nearly
double
the
qos
prefetch
size
if
we
connector_2
it
to
from
then
if
the
component_4
component_5
remain
at
4ms
per
connector_data_3
we
now
have
*
=
204ms
of
connector_data_1
in
the
buffer
of
which
4ms
will
be
spend
component_5
a
connector_data_3
leave
200ms
for
the
connector_9
an
ack
back
to
rabbit
and
connector_10
the
next
connector_data_3
thus
we
can
now
cope
with
the
requirement_2
halve
in
quality_attribute_5
but
if
the
network’s
perform
normally
double
our
qos
prefetch
now
mean
each
connector_data_3
will
sit
in
the
component_4
side
buffer
for
a
while
instead
of
be
component_5
immediately
upon
arrival
at
the
component_4
again
start
from
a
full
buffer
of
now
connector_data_1
we
that
connector_data_1
will
start
appear
at
the
component_4
100ms
after
the
component_4
finish
component_5
the
first
connector_data_3
but
in
those
100ms
the
component_4
will
have
component_5
=
connector_data_1
out
of
the
quality_attribute_3
which
mean
a
a
connector_data_3
arrive
at
the
component_4
it’ll
be
to
the
end
of
the
buffer
a
the
component_4
remove
from
the
head
of
the
buffer
the
buffer
will
thus
always
stay
=
connector_data_1
long
and
every
connector_data_3
will
thus
sit
in
the
buffer
for
*
=
100ms
increasing
the
quality_attribute_2
between
rabbit
connector_9
it
to
the
component_4
and
the
component_4
start
to
component_5
it
from
50ms
to
150ms
thus
we
see
that
increasing
the
prefetch
buffer
so
that
the
component_4
can
cope
with
deteriorate
requirement_2
requirement_1
whilst
keep
the
component_4
busy
substantially
increase
the
quality_attribute_2
when
the
requirement_2
be
perform
normally
equally
rather
than
the
network’s
requirement_1
deteriorate
what
happen
if
the
component_4
start
take
40ms
to
component_5
each
connector_data_3
rather
than
4ms
if
the
component_1
in
rabbit
be
previously
at
a
steady
length
i
e
ingres
and
egress
rat
be
the
same
it’ll
now
start
grow
rapidly
a
the
egress
rate
have
drop
to
a
tenth
of
what
it
be
you
might
decide
to
try
and
work
through
this
grow
backlog
by
more
component_7
but
there
be
connector_data_1
now
be
buffer
by
the
exist
component_4
assume
the
original
buffer
size
of
connector_data_3
the
component_4
will
spend
40ms
component_5
the
first
connector_data_3
will
then
connector_7
the
ack
back
to
rabbit
and
move
onto
the
next
connector_data_3
the
ack
still
take
50ms
to
connector_5
to
rabbit
and
a
further
50ms
for
rabbit
to
connector_7
out
a
connector_data_3
but
in
that
100ms
the
component_4
have
only
work
through
=
further
connector_data_1
rather
than
the
remain
connector_data_3
thus
the
buffer
be
at
this
point
=
connector_data_1
long
the
connector_data_3
arrive
from
rabbit
rather
than
be
component_5
immediately
now
sit
in
23rd
place
behind
other
connector_data_1
still
wait
to
be
component_5
and
will
not
be
touch
by
the
component_4
for
a
further
*
=
880ms
give
the
requirement_2
delay
from
rabbit
to
the
component_4
be
only
50ms
this
additional
880ms
delay
be
now
95%
of
the
quality_attribute_2
+
=
even
bad
what
happen
if
we
double
the
buffer
size
to
connector_data_1
in
order
to
cope
with
requirement_2
requirement_1
degradation
after
the
first
connector_data_3
have
be
component_5
there
will
be
further
connector_data_1
buffer
in
the
component_4
100ms
late
assume
the
requirement_2
be
run
normally
a
connector_data_3
will
arrive
from
rabbit
and
the
component_4
will
be
half
way
through
component_5
the
3rd
of
those
connector_data_1
the
buffer
will
now
be
connector_data_1
long
thus
the
connector_data_3
will
be
48th
in
the
buffer
and
will
not
be
touch
for
a
further
*
=
1880ms
again
give
the
requirement_2
delay
of
connector_11
the
connector_data_3
to
the
component_4
be
only
50ms
this
further
1880ms
delay
now
mean
component_4
side
buffer
be
responsible
for
over
97%
of
the
quality_attribute_2
+
=
this
very
well
be
unacceptable
the
connector_data_4
only
be
valid
and
useful
if
it’s
component_5
promptly
not
some
second
after
the
component_4
connector_12
it
if
other
connector_1
component_2
be
idle
there’s
nothing
they
can
do
once
rabbit
have
connector_3
a
connector_data_3
to
a
component_4
the
connector_data_3
be
the
client’s
responsibility
until
it
acks
or
reject
the
connector_data_3
component_2
can’t
steal
connector_data_1
from
each
other
once
the
connector_data_3
have
be
connector_3
to
a
component_4
what
you
want
be
for
component_2
to
be
keep
busy
but
for
component_2
to
buffer
a
few
connector_data_1
a
possible
so
that
connector_data_1
be
not
delay
by
component_4
side
buffer
and
thus
connector_1
component_2
can
be
quickly
fee
with
connector_data_1
from
rabbit’s
component_1
so
too
small
a
buffer
connector_data_5
in
component_2
go
idle
if
the
requirement_2
connector_13
slow
but
too
big
a
buffer
connector_data_5
in
lot
of
extra
quality_attribute_2
if
the
requirement_2
perform
normally
and
huge
amount
of
extra
quality_attribute_2
if
the
component_4
suddenly
start
take
long
to
component_5
each
connector_data_3
than
normal
it’s
clear
that
what
you
really
want
be
a
vary
buffer
size
these
problem
be
common
across
requirement_2
component_8
and
have
be
the
subject
of
much
study
active
component_1
requirement_3
algorithm
seek
to
try
and
drop
or
reject
connector_data_1
so
that
you
avoid
connector_data_1
sit
in
buffer
for
long
period
of
time
the
low
quality_attribute_2
be
achieve
when
the
buffer
be
keep
empty
each
connector_data_3
suffer
requirement_2
quality_attribute_2
only
and
do
not
sit
around
in
a
buffer
at
all
and
buffer
be
there
to
absorb
spike
jim
gettys
have
be
work
on
this
problem
from
the
point
of
pattern_3
of
requirement_2
pattern_4
difference
between
requirement_1
of
the
lan
and
the
wan
suffer
exactly
the
same
sort
of
problem
indeed
whenever
you
have
a
buffer
between
a
component_9
in
our
requirement_4
rabbit
and
a
component_7
the
component_4
side
component_6
component_10
where
the
requirement_1
of
both
side
can
vary
dynamically
you
will
suffer
these
sort
of
problem
recently
a
algorithm
connector_14
control
delay
have
be
publish
which
appear
to
work
well
in
solve
these
problem
the
author
claim
that
their
codel
“coddle”
algorithm
be
a
“knob
free”
algorithm
this
be
a
bit
of
a
lie
really
there
be
two
knob
and
they
do
need
set
appropriately
but
they
don’t
need
connector_15
every
time
requirement_1
connector_15
which
be
a
massive
benefit
i
have
connector_16
this
algorithm
for
our
technology_2
technology_3
component_4
a
a
variant
of
the
queueingconsumer
whilst
the
original
algorithm
be
aim
at
the
technology_4
pattern_5
where
it’s
valid
to
drop
packet
technology_4
itself
will
take
care
of
re
transmission
of
lose
packet
in
technology_2
that’s
not
so
polite
a
a
connector_data_2
my
implementation
u
rabbit’s
basic
nack
extension
to
explicitly
connector_data_1
to
the
component_1
so
they
can
be
component_5
by
others
use
it
be
pretty
much
the
same
a
the
normal
queueingconsumer
except
that
you
should
provide
three
extra
parameter
to
the
constructor
to
connector_5
the
best
requirement_1
the
first
be
requeue
which
say
whether
when
connector_data_1
be
nacked
should
they
be
requeued
or
discard
if
false
they
will
be
discard
which
connector_17
the
dead
letter
exchange
mechanism
if
they’re
set
up
the
second
be
the
targetdelay
which
be
the
acceptable
time
in
millisecond
for
connector_data_1
to
wait
in
the
component_4
side
qos
prefetch
buffer
the
third
be
the
interval
and
be
the
expect
worst
requirement_4
component_5
time
of
one
connector_data_3
in
millisecond
this
doesn’t
have
to
be
spot
on
but
within
an
order
of
magnitude
certainly
help
you
should
still
set
a
qos
prefetch
size
appropriately
if
you
do
not
what
be
likely
be
that
the
component_4
will
be
connector_3
a
lot
of
connector_data_3
and
the
algorithm
will
then
have
to
them
to
rabbit
if
they
sit
in
the
buffer
for
too
long
it’s
easy
to
end
up
with
a
lot
of
extra
requirement_2
traffic
a
connector_data_1
be
to
rabbit
the
codel
algorithm
be
mean
to
only
start
drop
or
reject
connector_data_1
once
requirement_1
diverge
from
the
norm
thus
a
work
example
might
help
again
assume
requirement_2
traversal
time
in
each
direction
of
50ms
and
we
expect
the
component_4
to
spend
4ms
on
average
component_5
each
connector_data_3
but
this
can
spike
to
20ms
we
thus
set
the
interval
parameter
of
codel
to
sometimes
the
requirement_2
half
in
quality_attribute_5
so
the
traversal
time
can
be
100ms
in
each
direction
to
cater
for
that
we
set
the
basic
qos
prefetch
to
=
yes
this
mean
that
the
buffer
will
remain
connector_data_1
long
most
of
the
time
when
the
requirement_2
be
run
normally
see
work
early
but
we
decide
that’s
ok
each
connector_data_3
will
thus
sit
in
the
buffer
for
an
expect
*
=
100ms
so
we
set
the
targetdelay
of
codel
to
when
thing
be
run
normally
codel
should
not
connector_5
in
the
way
and
few
if
any
connector_data_1
should
be
be
nacked
but
should
the
component_4
start
component_5
connector_data_1
more
slowly
than
normal
codel
will
spot
that
connector_data_1
have
be
buffer
by
the
component_4
for
too
long
and
will
those
connector_data_1
to
the
component_1
if
those
connector_data_1
be
requeued
then
they
will
become
quality_attribute_3
for
delivery
to
other
component_4
this
be
very
much
experimental
at
the
moment
and
it’s
possible
to
see
reason
why
codel
isn’t
a
appropriate
for
deal
with
technology_2
connector_data_1
a
it
be
for
plain
ip
it’s
also
worth
remember
that
requeuing
connector_data_1
via
nacks
be
a
fairly
expensive
so
it’s
a
quality_attribute_6
idea
to
set
the
parameter
of
codel
to
ensure
in
normal
very
few
if
any
connector_data_1
be
be
nacked
the
requirement_3
plugin
be
an
easy
way
to
inspect
how
many
connector_data_1
be
be
nacked
a
ever
feedback
and
improvement
be
most
welcome
