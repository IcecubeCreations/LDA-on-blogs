architectural
principle
if
at
every
turn
we
make
the
connector_4
require
by
the
architecture
at

we
ll
end
up
rework
the
same
area
of
repeatedly
to
minimize
rework
and
improve
the
chance
of
quality_attribute_1
it
help
to
have
some
guide
principle
a
we
go
a
with

orient

one
important
principle
to
apply
be
to
separate
thing
that
connector_5
from
thing
that
stay
the

we

also
try
to
introduce
some
pattern_1
of

while

a
book
on
pattern_2
we
ll
apply
them
where
appropriate
and
mention
them
wherever
they
re
use
another
guide
principle
be
the
idea
of
refactoring
‚Äîthat

the
idea
of
make
very
small
incremental

not

of

merely
to

that
