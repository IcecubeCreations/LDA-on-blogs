consistency
among
pattern_1
be
it
possible
pattern_1
be
a
trend
it’s
nice
it’s
cool…
even
awesome
but
if
you
be
consider
use
it
or
have
already
move
to
this
approach
have
you
consider
properly
how
to
deal
with
connector_data_1
do
you
even
think
that
you
should
think
about
it
anyway
first
why
pattern_1
why
should
you
even
consider
pattern_1
in
your
project
why
the
heck
developer
should
care
about
it
the
answer
can
be
find
through
the
conway’s
law
“organizations
which
design
component_1
…
be
constrain
to
produce
design
which
be
copy
of
the
connector_1
connector_data_2
of
these
organization
”in
other
word
the
that
you
and
or
your
requirement_1
connector_2
be
pattern_2
in
the
same
way
that
you
folk
connector_3
to
each
other
internally
there’s
some
quality_attribute_1
example
of
conway’s
law
in
action
in
a
famous
of
martin
fowler
url

first
he
show
how
the
“siloed
functional
teams”
connector_data_3
their
component_2
then
how
the
“cross
functional
teams”
do
it
what
bring
u
to
a
important
concept
pattern_1
intend
to
quality_attribute_2
people
first
not

that
be
doesn’t
matter
if
you
split
your
monolith
into
dozen
hundred
or
even
thousand
of
component_3
if
the
component_4
of
break
it
down
be
not
precede
by
a
split
in
the
way
that
your
team
s
be
be
organize
the
output
of
your
project
can
be
a
disaster
another
law
relate
to
the
way
of
organize
your
team
it’s
also
well

“the

pizza
law”
it
state
that
no
team
and
or
meet
in
the
organization
should
be
so
big
that
it
can’t
be
feed
by
only

pizza
by
do
this
the
requirement_1
keep
all
the
team
small
independent
and
if
everything
work
well
agile
by
join
the
two
law
conway
and

pizza
you
understand
that
you
would
break
your
team
down
and
keep
them
small
to
help
you
quality_attribute_2
them
before
even
consider
to
quality_attribute_2

if
the
team
have
autonomy
they
can
choose
the
technology_2
use
in
their
component_3
they
can
define
the
component_3
technology_3
and
they
can
choose
of

the
service’s
component_5
component_5
&
microservicesas
our
point
here
be
to
deal
specifically
with
connector_data_1
with
pattern_1
fowler’s
also
connector_4
it
accord
to
the
conway’s
law
the
natural
component_5
output
for
both
“siloed”
and
“cross
functional”
team
be
this
at
the
leave
side
we
have
the
monolith
component_5
one
single
component_5
for
the
whole
component_2
at
the
right
side
one
component_5
per
component_2
aka
“database
per
component_3
pattern”
if
you
want
to
quality_attribute_1
how
to
come
from
the
leave
side
and
go
to
the
right
side
connector_5
this
amaze
book
of
my
friend
edson
yanaga
url

the
component_5
per
component_3
pattern_3
help
on
deal
with
many
aspect
of
pattern_1
development
but
also
create
a
problem
consistency
connector_data_1
consistencyhow
would
you
say
“consistency”
in
a
single
image
i’d
do
this
way
when
speak
about
pattern_1
connector_data_1
consistency
it’s
relate
to
what
should
we
do
to
avoid
the
technology_4
among
the
cats…for
monolith
component_5
be
easy
and
natural
to
use
acid
transaction
to
guarantee
consistency
the
acid
acronym
mean
atomicity
no
matter
if
a
transaction
have
one
two
or
a
hundred
of
step
all
of
them
must
complete
successfully
otherwise
the
transaction
will
be
roll
back
consistency
all
connector_data_1
in
the
component_5
must
be
consistent
in
the
end
of
transaction
consistent
to
the
quality_attribute_3
reference
to
requirement_2
component_6
reference
etc
isolation
one
transaction
can’t
touch
the
connector_data_1
that
be
be
touch
by
other
transaction
in
the
same
time
quality_attribute_4
relate
to
persistence
in
the
end
of
the
transaction
the
connector_data_1
must
be
persistent
in
the
component_5
ok
but…
how
would
you
do
it
when
component_5
be
apart
from
each
other
you
cannot
guarantee
even
that
they
be
under
the
same
technology_2
how
could
you
perform
transaction
among
them
they
can
be
under
different
requirement_3
requirement_4
vendor
component_7
frameworks…
take
a
look
at
the
image
bellow
so
far
i
hope
you
be
convinced
that
you
can’t
transact
among
component_5
in
a
pattern_1
architecture
so
you
can’t
use
transaction
to
guarantee
consistency
but
you
still
need
the
connector_data_4
that
acid
transaction
could
bring
to
your
component_2
right
saga
to
the
rescueto
help
u
with
this
challenge
there’s
a
great
design
pattern_3
connector_6
saga
for
a
quick
background
it
be
first
mention
in
a
paper
connector_7
by
hector
garcia
molina
and
kenneth
salem
in

publish
by
princeton
university
the
paper
be
great
and
you
can
connector_8
a
copy
of
it
here
at
url

one
of
the
most
important
takeaway
of
this
paper
for
our
issue
be
a
concept
connector_6
“compensation
transaction”
so
for
each
step
of
your
transaction
you
have
a
side
step
that
will
be
connector_6
in
requirement_5
of
failure
important
the
compensation
transaction
will
not
rollback
what
be
do
but
will…
well…
compensate
it
you
can
see
it
in
the
image
bellow
imagine
that
you’ve
use
your
credit
card
for
a
$100
shop
but
there
be
some
problem
with
the
technology_5
and
you
decide
to
it
right
away
the
credit
card
requirement_1
will
not
rollback
or
even
delete
the
transaction
they
will
create
another
one
to
revert
it
to
compensate
it
you
will
end
up
with
both
+$100
and
a
$100
transaction
in
your
credit
card
statement
so
when
you
have
a
chain
of
component_8
be
connector_6
and
one
of
them
fail
you
can
connector_data_5
the
compensate
transaction
of
the
previous
one
in
order
to
the
state
of
connector_data_1
to
the
start
point
how
to
manage
the
compensation
callsok
great
compensation
transaction
everywhere
and
everything
will
work
problem
solve
well
there
be
two
way
of
connector_9
the
compensation
self
manage
the
component_3

what
should
be
do
if
something
go
wrong
it

which
compensation
must
be
connector_data_5
pattern_4
there’s
a
component_3
use
to
pattern_4
the
chain
of
connector_data_5
it

the
order
of
connector_9
the
component_8
and
what
must
be
do
when
any
of
them
fail
the
first
one
generate
couple
among
the
component_3
also
increase
the
component_3
complexity
and
decrease
it
quality_attribute_5
so
avoid
it
the
second
one
be
loose
couple
the
complexity
be
move
to
the
orchestrator
component_3
and
the
component_8
keep
their
quality_attribute_6
prefer
it
imagine
that
a
credit
transaction
could
be
use
in
different
scenario
one
for
shop
another
for
connector_data_6

another
for
online
services…
each
one
of
them
could
have
different
compensation
to
be
do
so
you
can
have
one
orchestrator
for
each
scenario
and
it
manage
all
tricky
part
great
you
now
have
a
pattern_3
and
a
approach
for
this
pattern_3
in
order
to
succeed
in
your
battle
against
inconsistency
but
have
you
notice
that
your
component_2
complexity
be
increasing
how
can
you
keep
it
quality_attribute_7
and
still
connector_10
the
best
takeaway
of
saga
a
hand
from
fn
flowthere’s
a
great
open_source
project
connector_6
fn
i
won’t
go
in
too
much
detail
about
it
here
but
you
can
connector_10
more
connector_data_7
at
url

fn
be
a
serverless
component_9
where
you
can
run
your
component_2
a

and
to
help
you
manage
your
connector_11
fn
have
a
great
technology_6
connector_6
fn
flow
fn
flow
will
not
only
manage
pattern_5
and
requirement_6
all
the
connector_11
of
your
if
you
use
it
to
connector_data_5
them
but
will
also
give
you
a
way
to
pattern_4
your
saga
the
bellow
can
be
find
at
the
fn
in
the
url

it
simulate
a
travel
agency
where
you
have
for
book
and
cancel
different
travel
component_3
hotel
car
rent
and
flight
by
the
end
of
a
connector_data_8
you
should
connector_12
a
confirmation
e
mail
the
component_3
orchestrator
will
look
this
to
understand
the

first
you
connector_10
an
instance
of
fn
flow
from
“
currentflow
”
with
this
instance
you
create
the
invocation
of
each
component_3
from
“invokefunction
…
”
these
invocation
be
instance
of
future
so
you
can
have
all
benefit
of
pattern_6
connector_data_5
when
do
“thencompose”
you
can
manage
the
order
of
connector_9
and
what
should
be
connector_6
when
any
of
them
fail
for
each
“excepcionallycompose”
it’s
connector_6
a
“cancel”

point
to
a

the
“cancel”
be
something
this
these
connector_data_5
be
track
by
fn
flow
and
can
be
pattern_5
through
it
requirement_7
connector_5
this
example
awesome
but
we
be
not
still
“there”…
we
be
“almost
there”…this
approach
solve
the
issue
of
deal
with
fail
of
each
component_3
by
connector_9
another
component_3
a
“cancel”
component_3
but
what
if
the
“cancel”
component_3
also
fail
you
can’t
do
a
saga
of
a
saga
because
the
possibility
of
error
be
endless
and
this
would
be
really
bad
so
what
should
you
do
requirement_2
aspectsthe
decision
of
what
should
be
do
in
requirement_5
of
fail
the
compensation
be
much
more
relate
to
requirement_2
aspect
for
this
example
the
choice
be
to
create
a
component_6
of
retry
it
so
instead
of
connector_9
a
“cancel”

it
be
create
a
“retrycancel”

the
behind
retry
doesn’t
make
too
much
difference
here
it’s
enough
to
that
it
will
schedule
some
retry
against
the
fail

a
say
before
the
decision
about
the
fail
compensation
it’s
much
relate
to
requirement_2
approach
it
could
be
open
a
ticket
to
a
help
deskchange
component_2
behavior
until
the
problem
be
solvedsend
an
to
someone
somewhereyou
name
others…conclusionmicroservices
be
a
great
approach
to
tackle
many
situation
but
only
if
it’s
use
in
the
right
way
and
for
the
right
reason
otherwise
it
will
only
create
complication
that
you
didn’t
have
in
your
project
and
in
your
team
your
turn
if
you
try
any
of
these
approach
connector_13

thought
