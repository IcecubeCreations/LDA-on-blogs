start
off
in
the
early
90
for
connector_data_1
warehousing
large
requirement_3
that
run
substantial
transaction
and
have
huge
component_2
base
use
extract
transform
load
technology_1
component_3
to
consolidate
pattern_1
connector_data_1
across
all
their
component_4
for
report
and
analysis
fast
connector_1
to
today
and
technology_1
still
remain
at
the
core
of
connector_data_1
warehousing
albeit
with
vastly
expand
requirement_4
component_5
and
variant
we’re
go
to
take
a
look
at
one
such
variant
in
this

design
to
connector_2
enormous
quality_attribute_2
in
certain
connector_data_1
requirement_5
requirement_6
by
reorder
the
extract
transform
load
component_6
to
extract
load
and
transform
elt
with
technology_1
connector_data_1
requirement_7
be
perform
by
copy
connector_data_1
from
disparate
component_7
into
a
stag
component_8
also
connector_3
technology_1
component_8
where
a
transformation
component_9
run
computation
and
to
transform
connector_data_1
into
require
style
and
technology_2
this
“transformed”
connector_data_1
have
be
prepare
to
conform
with
destination
connector_data_1
connector_data_3
be
load
into
the
target
connector_data_1
requirement_1
the
presence
of
the
middle
transformation
step
mean
that
connector_data_1
take
long
to
load
because
it
be
first
load
for
transformation
into
a
stag
component_8
and
then
load
again
to
a
target
pattern_2
coding_keyword_1
transformation
time
take
to
perform
complex
transformation
on
high
volume
of
connector_data_1
quickly

up
a
the
amount
of
connector_data_1
to
be
component_6
increase
quality_attribute_3
be
high
because
connector_data_1
need
to
be
selected
and
load
to
be
transform
these
be
the
issue
that
be
connector_4
effectively
by
reorder
the
technology_1
component_6
what
happen
when
we
switch
“l”
and
“t”
in
technology_1
once
connector_data_1
be
extract
from
component_10
component_11
it
can
also
be
load
directly
into
the
target
connector_data_1
requirement_1
without
transform
it
in
a
stag
area
first
the
transformation
and
connector_data_1
scrub
can
be
do
directly
in
the
component_12
utilize
it
own
resource
coding_keyword_1
load
note
that
in
the
cycle
outline
connector_data_1
be
be
extract
load
and
transform
the
technology_1
component_6
be
reorder
to
elt
which
bring
it
own
set
of
benefit
both
connector_data_1
requirement_7
architecture
offer
practical
benefit
but
it
must
consider
internal
capability
of
target
component_12
and
the
transformation
a
requirement_8
might
want
to
perform
in
those
component_12
recent
evolution
in
quality_attribute_4
component_6
power
such
a
massively
parallel
component_6
mpp
and
virtual
cluster
have
make
elt
increasingly
viable
when
large
amount
of
connector_data_1
need
to
be
component_6
fast
this
be
the
primary
goal
of
connector_5
the
transformation
component_13
down
to
the
target
component_12
which
bring
u
to
the
term
connector_6
down
optimization
what
be
connector_6
down
optimization
while
elt
have
be
around
for
quite
some
time
and
it
benefit
be
clear
it
be
still
not
very
common
because
implementation
require
deep
knowledge
of
technology_1
and
elt
and
specialize
technology_3
along
with
extensive
custom
script
modern
technology_1
technology_3
with
advance
automation
capability
be
connector_7
that
with
some
offer
a
build
in
connector_6
down
optimization
mode
that
allow
component_14
to
choose
when
to
use
elt
and
connector_6
the
transformation
component_13
down
to
the
component_12
component_9
with
a
click
of
a

this
approach
a
discuss
before
offer
enormous
requirement_9
benefit
by
remove
connector_data_1
movement
to
and
from
the
technology_1
component_8
when
component_6
large
amount
of
connector_data_1
that
require
minimal
transformation
elt
should
be
the
prefer
approach
and
choose
connector_6
down
mode
be
advisable
if
your
technology_1
technology_3
provide
it
on
the
other
hand
when
your
connector_data_1
require
extensive
conversion
and
transformation
before
it
be
ready
to
be
load
onto
the
target
connector_data_1
requirement_1
leverage
a
separate
transformation
component_9
to
perform
pre
load
might
be
a
quality_attribute_5
idea
this
approach
also
allow
you
to
perform
quality_attribute_6
connector_8
and
validation
before
connector_data_1
be
load
onto
it
destination
component_12
when
to
use
elt
a
discuss
above
elt
connector_9
connector_data_1
directly
from
component_10
to
target
but
this
also
mean
that
it
will
need
further
component_6
before
it
become
useful
let’s
take
a
look
at
three
instance
where
reorder
the
technology_1
component_6
be
more
beneficial
when
quality_attribute_7
be
critical
connector_data_1
be
ingest
much
fast
with
elt
because
there’s
no
need
for
an
technology_1
component_8
and
transformation
and
loading
can
happen
simultaneously
in
the
target
component_12
when
more
raw
connector_data_2
be
quality_attribute_5
in
requirement_6
when
have
refine
transform
connector_data_1
set
be
not
a
important
a
have
a
large
volume
of
raw
connector_data_1
so
it
can
be
mine
for
hide
pattern_3
elt
automatically
become
the
prefer
approach
quality_attribute_7
up
the
loading
component_6
at
the
cost
of
connector_10
raw
connector_data_1
when
use
high
end
component_6
component_9
modern
requirement_10
connector_data_1
requirement_1
appliance
and
component_12
offer
requirement_11
support
for
parallel
component_6
this
allow
your
elt
component_3
to
take
advantage
of
more
component_6
power
for
great
quality_attribute_8
the
flip
side
you
might
be
loading
poor
quality
connector_data_1
into
your
connector_data_1
requirement_1
unless
you
make
sure
that
you’re
use
elt
for
pattern_4
component_3
with
massive
workload
but
limit
requirement
of
transformation
scrub
and
validation
you
will
no
long
have
an
technology_1
component_8
design
to
component_6
complex
transformation
instead
you
will
have
massive
amount
of
connector_data_1
with
minimal
quality_attribute_9
quality_attribute_4
readily
for
analysis
by
connector_data_1
scientist
if
you
have
both
use
requirement_6
and
would
to
choose
whether
to
component_6
your
connector_data_1
with
technology_1
or
elt
at
run
time
or
even
if
you
want
to
component_6
connector_data_1
partially
through
elt
and
the
rest
with
technology_1
make
sure
you
choose
an
technology_1
technology_3
with
build
in
connector_6
down
mode
that
offer
this
capability
