here’s
your
crash
on
how
chatbots
work
and
the
difference
between
the
chatbots
of
yesteryear
and
the
requirement_6
powered
nlp
chatbots
if
the
word
“chatbot”
conjure
memory
of
frustrate
and
unnatural
conversation
worry
not
the
chatbots
of
today
be
sleek
and
sophisticate
in
fact
with
the
use
of
requirement_7
technology_2
they
can
even
feel
human
these
requirement_6
powered
chatbots
use
a
branch
of
requirement_6
connector_3
natural
technology_3
component_2
nlp
to
provide
a
quality_attribute_1
requirement_8
often
refer
to
a
virtual
agent
or
intelligent
virtual
assistant
these
nlp
chatbots
help
human
agent
by
take
over
repetitive
and
time
connector_4
connector_5
this
free
up
the
human
agent
to
concentrate
on
those
more
complex
requirement_9
that
require
human
input
but
how
do
this
all
work
understand
how
your
nlp
text
base
requirement_10
operate
will
help
you
ensure
it
stay
on
track
what’s
the
difference
between
nlp
nlu
and
nlg
there
be
several
acronym
in
the
world
of
automation
and
requirement_6
that
be
relevant
for
understand
how
your
virtual
agent
or
nlp
requirement_10
work
here
be
three
key
term
that
you
need
to
nlp
or
natural
technology_3
component_2
be
a
branch
of
requirement_6
that
help
component_3
connector_2
and
understand
natural
human
technology_3
it
goal
be
to
improve
human
component_4
connector_5
nlu
or
natural
technology_3
understand
be
a
branch
of
nlp
it
be
all
about
component_4
connector_6
comprehension
and
make
sure
the
component_4
understand
the
text’s
actual
mean
in
more
scientific
term
nlu
take
place
when
the
component_4
convert
the
user’s
inputted
connector_data_1
what
they’re
say
into
a
logical
form
that
the
component_5
s
algorithm
understand
and
the
more
quality_attribute_2
and
quality_attribute_3
an
requirement_6
component_6
be
in
identify
a
user’s
intent
the
more
powerful
the
solution
that
it
drive
will
be
nlg
or
natural
technology_3
generation
be
another
subset
of
nlp
which
be
essentially
nlu
in
reverse
the
component_4
generate
a
logical
connector_7
which
it
then
convert
to
a
natural
technology_3
connector_7
that
a
human
reader
can
easily
understand
connector_8
out
the
requirement_6
glossary
for
all
the
requirement_6
terminology
you
need
to
rule
base
chatbots
the
old
school
solution
the
stilted
buggy
chatbots
of
yesteryear
be
connector_3
rule
base
chatbots
these
requirement_11
aren
t
very
quality_attribute_4
in
how
they
connector_9
with
your
component_7
because
they
re
base
on
quality_attribute_5
keywords
or
pattern_1
match
so
take
this
question
for
example
“what
be
the
requirement_12
of
your
membership
”
this
question
can
be
match
with
similar
question
that
will
be
ask
by
requirement_3
in
the
future
the
rule
base
requirement_10
be
teach
how
to
respond
to
these
questions—but
the
wording
must
be
an
exact
match
this
mean
manually
programming
all
the
different
way
to
ask
how
much
a
membership
cost
for
every
possible
question
a
requirement_3
ask
which
be
incredibly
time
connector_10
that’s
not
to
say
this
type
of
requirement_10
can’t
be
useful
if
your
requirement_4
tend
to
connector_1
only
a
certain
number
of
question
that
be
usually
ask
in
a
few
way
then
a
quality_attribute_5
rule
base
requirement_10
be
probably
the
way
to
go
but
for
many
requirement_4
these
day
this
technology_2
be
not
powerful
enough
to
keep
up
with
their
requirement_3
query

each

they

one

from

even
if
interrupt
quality_attribute_6
to
connector_1
the
most
out
of
your
virtual
agent
you’ll
want
it
to
be
set
up
a
simply
a
possible
with
all
the
requirement_15
that
you
need—but
no
more
than
that
there
be
of
always
the
potential
to
upgrade
or
feature
a
you
need
late
on
how
requirement_6
chatbots
and
virtual
agent
work
now
it’s
time
to
really
connector_1
into
the
nitty
gritty
of
how
today’s
requirement_6
chatbots
work
there
be
five
major
step
involved—tokenizing
normalize
recognize
component_12
connector_17
requirement_16
and
generation—for
the
requirement_10
to
connector_2
interpret
understand
and
formulate
and
connector_14
a
connector_7
let’s
take
a
close
look
tokenizing
the
requirement_10
start
by
chop
up
text
into
piece
also
connector_3
‘tokens’
and
remove
punctuation
normalize
next
the
requirement_11
remove
detail
that
aren
t
relevant
and
convert
word
to
their
normal
version
for
example
by
make
everything
lowercase
recognize
component_12
now
that
the
word
be
all
normalize
the
requirement_10
seek
to
identify
which
type
of
thing
be
be
refer
to
for
example
it
would
identify
north
america
a
a
location
67%
a
a
percentage
and
a
an
organization
connector_17
requirement_16
for
the
next
step
the
requirement_11
identify
the
role
each
word
play
in
the
sentence
such
a
noun
verb
adjective
or
connector_data_3
generation
finally
the
requirement_10
generate
a
number
of
connector_7
use
the
connector_data_2
determine
in
all
the
other
step
and
select
the
most
appropriate
connector_7
to
connector_14
to
the
component_11
care
for
your
virtual
agent
one
of
the
most
impressive
thing
about
virtual
agent
be
that
they
connector_1
smart
with
each
connector_18
however
in
the
begin
nlp
chatbots
be
still
and
should
be
pattern_3
carefully
it
can
take
some
time
to
make
sure
the
nlp
technology_2
understand
your
component_7
and
provide
the
right
connector_7
now
that
you
understand
the
inner
work
of
nlp
requirement_7
and
requirement_6
powered
chatbots
you’re
ready
to
