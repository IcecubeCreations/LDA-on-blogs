way

any

we
pay

so
we
would

the

e

inconsistency
or
even

loss
without

pattern_4
we
will
end
up
with
a
quality_attribute_2
monolithic
component_5
—
a
messy
set
of
component_3
that
have
to
be
connector_2
and
quality_attribute_3
at
the
same
time
in
order
to
build
a
single
feature
a
quality_attribute_2
monolithic
component_5
be
often
much
bad
than
a
centralised
monolithic
component_5
because
of
the
complexity
and
cost
of
coordination
of
multiple
component_2
sometimes
across
multiple
team
in
the
meantime
it’s
also
important
to
realise
what
a
pattern_3
be
not
a
pattern_3
be
not
a
component_2
that
have
a
small
number
of
line
of
or
do
“micro”
connector_data_3
this
misconception
come
from
the
name
“microservice”
the
goal
of
the
pattern_3
architecture
be
not
to
have
a
many
small
component_3
a
possible
component_3
could
be
complex
and
substantial
a
long
a
they
meet
the

be

all
the
time
even
though
the
pattern_3
architecture
allow
team
to
test
technology_2
more
easily
it
be
not
the
primary
goal
of
pattern_3
architecture
it
be
totally
fine
to
build
component_3
with
the
exact
same
technology_2
technology_6
a
long
a
the
team
benefit
from
decouple

a
pattern_3
be
not
a

that
have
to
be
build

you
have
a
well
architected
monolithic

already
avoid

there

and

rewrite
of
everything
this
be
the
wrong
approach
we
should
never
build
component_3
for
the
sake
of
build
component_2
every
time
we
build
a
component_2
or
adopt
a

there
must

compare

engineering
requirement_6
should

and
fast
if
build

do
not
have
either
technology_8
requirement_6
or
engineering
requirement_6
we
leave
it
in
the
monolithic

it
be
totally
fine
if
in
ten
year
still
have
a
monolithic

that
support

component_10
connector_13
persistent
connector_data_2
storage
across
component_3
often
appear
to
be
the
easy
way
to
quality_attribute_4
pattern_1
together
however
it
be
actually
detrimental
and
we
should
avoid
it
at
all
cost
here
be
why
first
of
all
persistent
connector_data_2
storage
be
about
implementation
detail
connector_13
connector_data_2
storage
across
component_3
connector_14
the
implementation
detail
of
one
component_2
to
the
entire
component_5
if
that
component_2
connector_4
the
technology_10
of
the
connector_data_2
or

pattern_10
pattern_11
or
switch
to
different
type
of
component_10
many
other
component_3
have
to
be
connector_2
accordingly
a
well
this
violate
the
principle
of
loose
couple
secondly
persistent
connector_data_2
storage
be
not
component_2
behavior
i
e
how
to
modify
interpret
and
use
the
connector_data_2
if
we
connector_11
connector_data_2
storage
across
component_2
it
mean
other
component_3
also
have
to
replicate
component_2
behavior
this
violate
the
principle
of
high
pattern_4
—
behavior
in
a
give
domain
be
leak
to
multiple
component_2
if
we
modify
one
behavior
we
will
have
to
modify
all
of
these
component_3
together
in
pattern_3
architecture
only
one
component_2
should
be
responsible
for
a
specific
type
of
connector_data_2
all
the
other
component_3
should
either
connector_data_4
the
connector_data_2
through
the
component_14
of
the
responsible
component_2
or
keep
a
connector_9
only
non
canonical
maybe
materialize
copy
of
the
connector_data_2
this
sound
abstract
so
here
be
a
concrete
example
say
we
be
build
a
recommendation
component_2
and
it
need
some
connector_data_2
from
the
canonical
component_17
currently
in
technology_11
technology_12
we
could
make
the
connector_data_2
quality_attribute_5
for
the
recommendation
component_2
in
one
of
two
way
in
the
monolithic
storage
component_4
the
recommendation
component_2
have
direct
connector_8
to
the
same
persistent
storage
that
the
monolithic
component_6
do
this
be
a
bad
idea
because
pattern_10
can
be
tricky
if
the
recommendation
component_2
connector_15
the
same
pattern_10
a
the
monolithic
component_6
we
will
have
to
duplicate
the
pattern_10
implementation
detail
in
the
recommendation
component_2
a
well
if
the
recommendation
component_2
us
it
own
pattern_10
we
won’t
when
to
invalidate
it
pattern_10
when
the
monolithic
component_6
connector_data_5
the
connector_data_2
if
the
monolithic
component_6
decide
to
connector_2
to
use
rds
instead
of
technology_12
to
component_18
connector_data_2
we
will
have
to
reimplement
the
component_7
in
the
recommendation
component_2
and
all
other
component_3
that
connector_8
the
connector_data_2
a
well
the
monolithic
component_6
have
complex
component_7
to
interpret
the
connector_data_2
e
g
how
to
decide
if
a
should
not
be
viewable
to
a
give
component_11
we
have
to
reimplement
those
component_7
in
the
recommendation
component_2
once
the
monolithic
component_6
connector_4
or

component_7
we
need
to
make
the
same
connector_4
everywhere
a
well
the
recommendation
component_2
be
stick
with
technology_12
even
if
it
be
the
wrong
option
for
it
own
connector_data_2
connector_8
pattern_6
in
the
decouple
storage
component_4
the
recommendation
component_2
do
not
have
direct
connector_8
to
the
connector_data_2
neither
do
any
other
component_2
the
implementation
detail
of
connector_data_2
be
retain
in
only
one
component_2
there
be
different
way
of
achieve
this
ideally
there
should
be
a
component_2
that
own
the
connector_data_2
and
other
component_3
can
only
connector_8
connector_data_2
through
the
service’s
apis
however
it
could
be
an
expensive
upfront
investment
to
build
component_3
for
all
core
connector_data_2
component_4
there
be
a
couple
of
more
pragmatic
way
when
staff
be
limit
they
could
be
actually
quality_attribute_1
way
quality_attribute_6
on
the
connector_data_2
connector_8
pattern_6
in
option
b
the
monolithic
component_6

the
recommendation
component_3
when
relevant
connector_data_2
be
update
usually
this
doesn’t
have
to
happen
immediately
so
we
can
offload
it
to
the
pattern_12
component_5
in
option
technology_13
an
technology_14
pipeline
generate
a
connector_9
only
copy
of
the
connector_data_2
for
the
recommendation
component_2
plus
potentially
other
connector_data_2
that
be
useful
for
recommendation
a
well
in
both
option
the
recommendation
component_2
own
it
connector_data_2
completely
so
it
have
the
quality_attribute_7
to
pattern_10
the
connector_data_2
or
use
whatever
component_10
technology_2
that
fit
the
best
decouple
“building
a
service”
and
“running
services”if
build
pattern_1
be
hard
run
component_3
be
often
even
hard
it
slow
the
engineering
team
down
when
run
component_3
be
couple
with
build
each
component_2
and
team
have
to
keep
reinvent
the
way
of
do
it
we
want
to
each
component_2
focus
on
it
own
work
and
not
worry
about
the
complex
matter
of
how
to
run
component_2
include
requirement_7
connector_3
technology_1
deployment
observability
etc
the
component_2
requirement_2
should
be
completely
decouple
from
each
individual
service’s
implementation
the
strategy
of
decouple
“building
a
service”
and
“running
services”
be
to
make
run
component_2
connector_data_6
component_2
technology_2
agnostic
and
opinionated
so
that
component_6
engineer
can
fully
focus
on
each
service’s
own
requirement_5
component_7
thanks
to
the
recent
technology_2
advancement
in
containerization
container
pattern_13
component_2
mesh
component_1
requirement_1
pattern_7
etc
the
decouple
of
“running

become
more
achievable
than
ever
requirement_7

e
g
component_2
discovery
connector_16
load
balance
traffic
connector_16
etc
be
a
critical
part
of
run
component_2
the
traditional
approach
be
to
provide
technology_15
for
every
component_19
technology_16
it
work
but
be
not
ideal
because
component_12
still
need
a
non
trivial
amount
of
work
to
quality_attribute_4
and
maintain
the
technology_15
more
often
than
not
component_12
still
need
to
connector_17
some
of
the
component_7
separately
the
modern
solution
be
to
run
component_3
in
a
component_2
mesh
at

we
use
istio
and
envoy
a
sidecar
pattern_14
component_1
engineer
who
build
component_3
don’t
need
to
worry
about
the
requirement_7
at
all
connector_3
technology_1
no
matter
which
tech
technology_6
or
technology_16
you
choose
to
build
pattern_1
it
be
extremely
important
to
start
with
a
mature
pattern_15
solution
that
be
quality_attribute_8
type
cross
component_19
and
require
the
minimum
amount
of
development
overhead
pattern_15
solution
that
support
backward
quality_attribute_9
also
make
it
quality_attribute_10
to
quality_attribute_3
component_3
even
with
connector_18
among
them
at

we
choose
grpc
a
common
alternative
be
rest+json
over
technology_17
which
have
be
the
bless
solution
for
component_16
connector_3
for
a
long
time
however
although
that
technology_6
be
great
for
the
browser
to
talk
to
component_16
it
be
inefficient
for
component_16
to
component_16
connector_3
especially
when
we
need
to
connector_19
a
large
number
of
connector_data_4
without
automatically
generate
stub
and
boilerplate

we
will
have
to
manually
connector_17
the
component_16
component_8

quality_attribute_11
pattern_15
implementation
be
more
than
wrap
a
requirement_7
component_8
in
addition
pattern_16
be
“opinionated”
but
it
can
be
difficult
to
always
connector_5
everyone
to

on

currently
our

it
work

it

each

e

the
port
to
listen
to
the

to
build
test
start
the

etc
and
bbfd
will
take

of
the
rest
thorough
and
consistent

include
the
component_15
convention
and
technology_19
that
u
understand
how
the
component_5
be
work
and
triage
issue
when
it
isn’t
work
observability
include
requirement_8
requirement_1
track
metric
requirement_9
alerting
and
be
super
critical
for
the
pattern_3
architecture
to
succeed
when
we
move
from
one
single
component_2
to
a
quality_attribute_2
component_5
with
many
component_2
two
thing
can
happen
we
lose
observability
because
it
become
hard
to
do
or
easy
to
be
overlook
different
team
reinvent
the
wheel
and
we
end
up
with
fragment
observability
which
be
essentially
low
observability
because
it
be
hard
to
use
fragment
connector_data_2
to
connector_21
the
dot
or
triage
any
issue
it
be
very
important
to
have
quality_attribute_1
and
consistent
observability
from
the
begin
so
our
devops
team
come
up
with
a
strategy
for
consistent
observability
and
build
technology_19
in
support
of
achieve
that
every
component_2
connector_22
detail
datadog
requirement_9
alert
and
requirement_8
search
automatically
which
be
also
consistent
across
all
component_2
we
also
heavily
use
lightstep
to
understand
the
requirement_1
of
the
component_5
not
every
component_2
need
to
be
build
from
scratchin
pattern_3
architecture
each
component_2
do
one
thing
and
do
it
really
well
notice
that
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
how
to
build
a
component_2
if
you
migrate
from
a
monolithic
component_2
keep
in
mind
that
a
pattern_3
doesn’t
always
have
to
be
build
from
scratch
if
you
can
peel
it
off
from
the
monolithic
component_6
here
we
take
a
pragmatic
approach
whether
we
should
build
a
component_2
from
scratch
quality_attribute_6
on
two
factor

how
well
technology_9
be
suit
for
the
connector_data_3
and

how
much
it
cost
to
reimplement
in
a
different
tech
technology_6
if
technology_9
be
a
quality_attribute_1
technical
option
and
the
exist
implementation
be
in
a
quality_attribute_1
shape
we
peel
the
off
from
the
monolithic
component_6
and
create
a
pattern_3
with
it
even
with
the
same
implementation
we
will
still
connector_5
all
the
benefit
of
pattern_3
architecture
our
monolithic
technology_9
monolithic
component_6
be
architected
in
a
way
that
make
it
relatively
easy
for
u
to
build
separate
component_3
with
the
exist
implementation
we
will
discus
how
to
properly

we

first
and

we
should
expect
everything
will
fail
at

for
