how
technology_1
component_1
can
benefit
requirement_1
component_2
organization
that
build
requirement_1
component_2
with
a
lot
of
requirement_4
with
back
end
component_6
should
consider
technology_1
but
first
be
aware
of
these
pro
and
con
connector_2
this
item
with
your
requirement_2
by
robert
sheldon
publish
aug
it
can
be
a
complex
component_7
to
connector_3
requirement_1
requirement_5
component_2
and
connector_4
them
to
back
end
component_8
but
technology_1
component_1
offer
a
quality_attribute_2
connector_5
most
requirement_6
component_9
need
to
connector_6
with
back
end
component_4
such
a
directory
component_10
component_11
component_12
or
storage
component_6
to
connector_1
the
connector_data_1
and
component_6
they
need
to
conduct
requirement_5
requirement_1
component_2
be
no
different
but
they
also
come
with
additional
unique
challenge
for
example
because
requirement_1
component_2
run
on
component_5
with
le
component_7
power
and
memory
than
a
typical
desktop
it
need
to
offload
more
of
the
component_7
to
back
end
component_11
it
often
connector_data_2
requirement_1
component_13
front
end
more
frequently
than
back
end
component_4
or
the
component_14
that
facilitate
connector_7
which
can
complicate
connector_8
especially
if
component_13
connector_data_2
be
not
concurrent
across
all
the
component_15
developer
must
also
contend
with
unique
component_16
and
component_15
feature
many
requirement_1
component_5
support
fingerprint
pattern_1
which
developer
must
incorporate
into
the
large
quality_attribute_1
and
pattern_1
infrastructure
at
the
same
time
developer
have
to
cope
with
feature
that
can
have
an
indirect
effect
on
quality_attribute_1
such
a
camera
and
gps
a
requirement_1
component_13
must
also
be
able
to
work
across
different
connector_9
type
include
4g
requirement_2
wi
fi
and
corporate
requirement_2
which
can
connector_10
a
end
component_17
connector_10
location
these
connector_10
requirement_2
can
also
lead
to
intermittent
connector_8
which
make
it
necessary
for
component_2
to
have
offline
connector_8
in
addition
to
these
challenge
developer
must
build
component_2
that
run
on
different
o
different
version
of
those
o
and
different
component_15
type
which
range
from
smartphones
to
tablet
to
smartwatches
technology_1
component_1
to
the
rescue
many
developer
customize
their
component_2
to
support
connector_8
to
different
resource
which
can
be
a
long
component_7
technology_1
component_1
can
help
enable
and
simplify
connector_8
between
requirement_1
component_2
and
back
end
component_4
no
matter
the
type
of
component_8
or
it
location
technology_1
sit
between
the
back
end
resource
and
requirement_1
component_2
abstract
the
complexity
that
come
with
connector_4
to
resource
technology_1
also
u
technology_2
base
technology_3
such
a
quality_attribute_2
connector_data_3
connector_1
technology_4
and
rest
but
technology_1
do
more
than
manage
connector_8
with
technology_1
component_16
developer
have
a
single
gateway
to
back
end
component_8
which
make
it
easy
for
them
to
connector_4
their
requirement_1
component_2
to
corporate
resource
they
t
need
to
customize
each
version
of
an
component_13
to
accommodate
the
requirement
of
the
individual
component_8
it
admins
can
modify
those
component_4
without
break
all
the
component_3
they
only
need
to
update
the
technology_1
but
technology_1
do
more
than
manage
connector_8
a
comprehensive
component_16
also
handle
issue
such
a
quality_attribute_3
load
balance
concurrent
component_7
and
transaction
requirement_3
in
addition
the
component_16
ensure
that
the
connector_9
and
back
end
component_4
be
protect
and
quality_attribute_4
incorporate
pattern_1
pattern_2
and
other
protection
technology_3
a

some

component_1
also
make
it
possible
to
connector_3
custom

that
carry
