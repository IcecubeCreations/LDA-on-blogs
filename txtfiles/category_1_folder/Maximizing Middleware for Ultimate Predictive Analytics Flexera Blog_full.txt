the
connector_data_2
little
secret
there’s
something
about
your
connector_data_2
that
no
one
be
tell
you
it’s
the
unspoken
secret
that
all
of
the
connector_data_2
you’re
mining
warehousing
and
databasing
isn’t
exactly
contribute
much
to
the
success
of
your
requirement_10
we’ve
all
be
convinced
into
think
we
must
connector_2
hold
of
a
much
requirement_7
connector_data_2
a
possible
and
we
have
comply
we
have
connector_data_2
everywhere
it’s
in
pattern_3
whose
intent
be
to
a
technopedia
define
it
“keep
different
kind
of
connector_data_2
together
yet
separate
by
a
component_6
or
other
container
sound
fine
and
well
until
you
begin
to
have
so
many
component_6
and
component_7
that
it
become
difficult
to
find
anything
at
all
all
of
that
connector_data_2
sit
in
silo
and
isn’t
be
maximize
because
it
isn’t
be
effectively
quality_attribute_3
with
other
connector_data_2
across
component_8
to
form
a
comprehensive
requirement_7
profile
it’s
still
bit
and
piece
instead
of
a
detail
picture
of
requirement_7
behavior
preference
demographic
and
opportunity
the
purpose
requirement_7
connector_data_2
be
the
holy
grail
for
most
requirement_10
the
more
they
about
their
requirement_7
the
quality_attribute_4
they
can
connector_3
technology_2
and
component_9
they
not
assume
the
requirement_7
actually
want
with
every
single
swipe
of
a
credit
or
debit
card
every
online
purchase
every
visit
and
every
search
requirement_7
leave
behind
connector_data_2
this
be
the
connector_data_2
requirement_10
want
and
will
either
pay
for
or
go
to
great
length
and
investment
to
collate
themselves
the
requirement_10
component_10
consist
mainly
of
developer
marketer
and
sale
these
be
the
folk
who
need
to
what
technology_2
to
design
and
bring
to
requirement_11
which
requirement_11
pattern_4
work
best
and
what
sale
pitch
be
go
to
close
the
deal
without
requirement_7
connector_data_2
it’s
throw
spaghetti
at
a
wall
to
see
what
stick
with
it
however
requirement_10
can
be
much
more
target
in
their
approach
–
much
more
competitive
and
much
more
requirement_9
lead
they
can
reduce
cost
increase
quality_attribute_5
and
build
brand
reputation
the
issue
a
we’ve
toss
the
paper
in
lieu
of
pattern_1
component_3
demand
for
these
technology_5
have
skyrocket
requirement_5
computing
spend
be
grow
at
nearly
time
the
rate
of
it
spend
and
be
expect
to
increase
to
more
than
time
the
rate
through
of
where
there
be
demand
there
be
opportunity
requirement_10
have
fill
the
gap
to
overflow
there
be
component_11
for
everything
not
the
least
of
which
be
crms
connector_4
component_11
collaboration
sale
force
and
requirement_11
automation
component_6
requirement_4
component_12
and
requirement_12
resource
requirement_4
there
be
literally
hundred
of
possibility
that
promise
to
do
everything
from
improve
productivity
to
technology_6
teamwork
preference
for
these
technology_5
be
highly
subjective
and
no
one
requirement_10
will
use
the
same
set
of
technology_5
in
fact
even
within
a
single
requirement_10
there
be
often
department
who
prefer
their
own
component_11
instead
of
use
what
other
department
be
use
for
the
same
purpose
quality_attribute_6
on
a
company’s
requirement_13
and
governance
department
and
individual
requirement_14
be
free
to
sign
up
and
use
any
component_4
they
find
the
most
useful
pattern_1
requirement_4
and
pattern_1
contract
be
complicate
this
create
a
whole
lot
of
unintegrated
connector_data_2
that
be
connector_data_2
that
isn’t
connector_data_1
from
requirement_7
to
requirement_11
from
requirement_7
to
research
and
development
from
requirement_7
to
sale
the
connector_data_2
be
there
but
no
one
be
talk
to
each
other
requirement_11
doesn’t
have
connector_1
to
all
of
the
potential
requirement_7
connector_data_2
they
could
use
to
improve
advertising
requirement_15
sale
doesn’t
enough
to
target
their
effort
on
a
per
requirement_7
basis
r&d
focus
on
line
extension
rather
than
innovate
technology_2
base
on
requirement_7
connector_data_2
welcome
to
the
party
technology_1
technology_1
use
to
be
the
go
to
for
developer
it
help
them
connector_5
component_2
so
they
could
build
quality_attribute_4
today
however
technology_1
have
reinvent
itself
it’s
now
help
requirement_10
bring
together
all
of
the
disjoint
connector_data_2
from
across
their
requirement_12
and
beyond
organization
recognize
the
requirement_6
in
all
of
the
connector_data_2
they
have
scatter
across
the
requirement_10
they
want
to
leverage
everything
they
have
even
combine
it
with
purchase
requirement_7
connector_data_2
from
third
party
to
connector_6
ahead
of
the
competition
it’s
not
sale
requirement_11
and
r&d
either
everyone
from
finance
to
hr
want
a
piece
of
the
pie
because
this
kind
of
connector_data_2
help
them
plan
and
predict
forecast
and
analyze
technology_1
be
come
to
the
rescue
offer
connector_data_2
centralization
unlike
anything
we’ve
see
in
the
past
it
promise
to
combine
requirement_7
requirement_11
sale
and
infrastructure
connector_data_2
to
give
requirement_10
what
they
really
want
–
not
connector_data_2
but
unify
connector_data_2
that
tell
a
story
so
they
can
make
smart
decision
to
increase
marketshare
connector_7
of
wallet
and
revenue
the
singular
pattern_5
it’s
one
thing
to
have
component_6
float
around
contain
fragment
of
quality_attribute_7
connector_data_2
it’s
quite
another
to
have
a
singular
pattern_5
that
paint
a
comprehensive
picture
this
singular
pattern_5
be
prize
material
and
it
go
well
beyond
the
requirement_7
many
requirement_10
be
use
this
unify
connector_data_2
internally
to
track
requirement_14
and
their
component_4
utilization
why
be
this
important
because
all
of
those
component_11
be
cost
requirement_10
money
and
many
of
the
component_11
aren’t
be
fully
utilize
either
feature
aren’t
need
or
requirement_14
be
not
use
them
a
anticipate
some
license
be
be
renew
every
year
even
after
an
requirement_14
be
no
long
employ
every
component_4
equal
per
seat
license
that
often
automatically
renew
without
a
unify
pattern_5
of
your
internal
ecosystem
you’re
lose
money
without
even
realize
it
relate
take
control
of
your
pattern_1
spend
your
contract
the
singular
pattern_5
isn’t
only
about
the
requirement_7
it’s
about
gather
all
kind
of
connector_data_2
so
every
department
can
be
more
quality_attribute_8
more
productive
and
more
competitive
the
focus
be
on
the
requirement_7
but
the
internal
quality_attribute_5
can
help
a
requirement_10
become
more
lean
quality_attribute_3
and
engage
it’s
use
all
of
the
connector_data_2
you
have
at
your
fingertip
to
be
a
quality_attribute_4
requirement_10
to
requirement_7
requirement_14
and
stockholder
predictive
requirement_1
be
the
future
connector_data_2
be
the
begin
what
requirement_10
can
do
with
that
connector_data_2
be
the
future
predictive
requirement_1
be
the
goal
–
to
have
connector_1
to
unify
connector_data_2
set
that
enable
decision
maker
to
predict
requirement_7
behavior
so
they
can
stay
one
step
ahead
they
can
develop
technology_2
ahead
of
demand
–
even
create
demand
they
stay
ahead
of
the
competition
a
well
make
these
connector_data_2
set
the
most
prize
asset
in
the
requirement_10
who
own
these
connector_data_2
set
often
it’s
technology_1
requirement_10
who
do
nothing
but
build
these
connector_data_2
set
with
the
intent
to
sell
sometimes
it’s
the
b2c
requirement_10
themselves
use
to
begin
build
their
own
connector_data_2
set
that
become
their
own
secret
sauce
the
connector_data_2
set
build
on
each
other
gain
increasingly
more
requirement_7
and
or
requirement_14
connector_data_4
that
singular
pattern_5
become
more
hone
comprehensive
and
quality_attribute_9
–
and
it’s
all
base
on
real
time
connector_data_4
predictive
requirement_1
help
requirement_10
develop
quality_attribute_4
technology_2
and
connector_3
quality_attribute_4
component_1
but
it
also
help
them
be
more
quality_attribute_8
they
can
pattern_6
everything
from
those
component_4
license
and
utilization
to
quality_attribute_4
understand
their
requirement_14
base
on
their
past
requirement_15
and
current
behavior
requirement_10
can
how
much
they
should
be
pay
for
technology_7
for
example
base
on
connector_data_2
set
with
gather
connector_data_4
on
what
other
requirement_10
have
recently
pay
for
the
same
feature
it’s
the
kelly
blue
book
for
car
or
kayak
for
travel
the
connector_data_2
be
there
why
not
leverage
it
to
inform
decision
without
all
of
the
manual
effort
typically
require
it
asset
requirement_4
it
all
start
with
what’s
in

flexera

discover
even
the
most
elusive
asset
whether
on

saas
requirement_5
container
and
more
discover
more
it’s
in
the
report
report
have
always
be
important
but
with
all
of
these
connector_data_2
set
now
be
tap
into
report
become
invaluable
requirement_10
must
have
connector_1
to
the
connector_data_2
a
well
a
be
able
to
generate
the
report
on
demand
so
they
can
make
use
of
the
connector_data_2
connector_8
report
from
individual
vendor
isn’t
enough
because
the
problem
of
disjoint
connector_data_2
will
raise
it
ugly
head
once
again
remember
the
goal
be
to
unify
connector_data_2
requirement_10
must
find
report
mechanism
that
can
cut
across
every
connector_data_2
set
every
component_6
every
connector_data_2
point
in
order
to
present
an
quality_attribute_9
picture
of
exactly
what’s
go
on
gather

and
then
manually
connector_5
the

be
inefficient
error
prone

today’s
be
capable

automatically
present
that

it
wrap
