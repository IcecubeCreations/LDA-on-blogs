how
do

everything

to
about
these

and
why
they
be

important
for
the
work
of

out
there
let’s
start
with
the
basics…
what
be
technology_1
exactly
technology_1
be
the
foundation
of
today’s
connector_data_1
drive
requirement_3
even
if
it’s
an
abbreviation
you
don’t
hear
too
much
about
it
essentially
separate
the
analysis
part
from
everything
that
come
before
it
it
stand
for
extract
transform
and
load
and
essentially
describe
a
three
step
component_5
extract
connector_data_1
be
about
acquire
it
from
a
particular
component_3
and
do
so
in
a
way
that
all
relevant
connector_data_1
be
connector_5
for
technology_1
to
work
well
connector_data_1
need
to
come
directly
from
the
component_3
and
in
it
raw
form
transform
connector_data_1
require
it
to
be
strip
of
it
various
technology_4
clean
and
harmonize
put
differently
it
need
to
become
easy
for
the
end
component_8
to
connector_8
ensure
the
high
possible
connector_data_1
quality
be
crucial
during
this
component_5
include
detecting
and
remove
duplicate
and
sorting
the
connector_data_1
into
relevant
predetermine
category
in
the
end
your
technology_1
technology_3
will
help
harmonize
your
connector_data_1
and
load
it
into
a
target
location
which
essentially
be
a
requirement_10
intelligence
pattern_1

of

there
you
can

the

you
work

begin
with

first

you
launch
several

you
already
have
a
storm
of

come
your

also

the

to
make
sense
of

in

that

come
in

wait
for
you
you
need
to
how
to
find
it
you’ve
come
to
the
point
where
you
you
need
an
technology_1
technology_3
and
you
be
stand
at
a
crossroad
a
to
which
one
of
the
many
to
choose
for

you
need
to
decide
what
you
want
exactly
you
want
from
your
technology_1
technology_3
how
often
you
will
be
use
it
and
if
you
can
afford
it
so
let’s
start
with
the
basic
look
for
a
technology_3
that
can
connector_12
to
all
the
component_12
you
use
make
sure
the
technology_3
be
able
to
connector_22
all
the
connector_data_1
you
need
in
it
entirety
and
in
high
quality
you
need
a
technology_3
that
ensure
your
connector_data_1
will
be
connector_5
easily
and
quickly
after
all
technology_1
be
suppose
to
connector_9
you
work
not
more
to
the
already
busy
schedule
you
have
in
light
of
make
sure
your
chosen
technology_1
technology_3
be
also
easy
to
set
up
and
maintain
ideally
you
would
have
it
manage
in
house
look
for
a
technology_3
with
high
quality_attribute_4
technology_9
it
be
all
about
connector_data_1
privacy
these
day
and
you
want
to
play
by
the
rule
find
a
technology_3
that
be
cost
quality_attribute_9
and
fit
within
your
budget
go
into
a
bit
more
detail
there
be
two
category
of
technology_1
technology_3
that
you
need
to
consider
the
connector_data_1
syncers
and
the
connector_data_1
transformer
connector_data_1
syncers
help
you
move
connector_data_1
from
one
or
more
component_12
to
another
while
connector_data_1
transformer
go
through
the
component_5
of
connector_5
transform
and
enrich
the
connector_data_1
a
well
a
loading
into
a
target
location
they
be
often
more
complex
and
have
quality_attribute_2
component_16
to
support
a
more
diverse
set
of
connector_data_1
component_3
why
you
should
look
for
one
technology_3
to
rule
all
your
requirement_3
connector_data_1
since
you
be
probably
already
work
with
requirement_13
you
have
likely
by
now
that
with
it
come
a
lot
of
challenge
requirement_13
come
from
different
component_3
in
different
technology_4
and
be
often
scatter
and
messy
and
the
more
component_12
you
have
the
more
difficult
it
will
be
to
quality_attribute_2
them
all
the
more
external
party
you
will
be
work
with
but
be
that
really
the
way
to
go
connector_data_1
requirement_1
be
all
about
reel
in
all
the
connector_data_1
you
have
and
embrace
it
full
potential
it
be
also
about
simplify
the
component_9
of
connector_5
clean
and
transform
that
connector_data_1
so
you
can
have
more
time
to
spend
on
make
actual
decision
base
on
it
now
one
way
to
go
about
this
be
of
to
work
with
a
number
of
different
contractor
and
their
component_17
in
the
hope
that
you
will
tame
all
that
connector_data_1
come
your
way
if
that’s
the
way
you
want
to
go
great
but
here’s
the
thing
the
more
external
party
you
work
with
the
more
and
different
input
you
will
be
connector_7
and
isn’t
the
goal
of
connector_data_1
requirement_1
exactly
the
opposite
to
have
thing
standardise
go
connector_23
organisation
that
want
to
make
the
most
of
their
requirement_3
connector_data_1
should
consider

really
make
their
life
easy

at

we’re
completely
honest
today
you
need
a

even
in

can
have
if
you’re
look
for
quality_attribute_11
tight
quality_attribute_4
and
control
an
on
premise
connector_data_1
requirement_12
be
the
choice
for
you
you
be
sure
to
have
all
your
connector_data_1
in
the
component_19
room
at
the
back
of
your
office
make
it
a
quality_attribute_12
a
it
possibly
can
be
quality_attribute_4
be
also
the
benefit
of
the
requirement_16
where
technology_10
be
be
update
on
a
regular
basis
and
potential
bug
be
be
fix
a
soon
a
they
be
detected
quality_attribute_11
be
certainly
a
strong
feat
for
on
premise
solution
since
component_10
do
not
have
to
wait
on
connector_data_1
to
bounce
through
multiple
component_20
–
often
in
multiple
far
away
country
in
term
of
quality_attribute_13
both
solution
have
their
advantage
with
the
difference
that
in
the
requirement_16
you
quality_attribute_14
on
choose
the
right
technology_11
while
in
house
you
can
hire
the
expert
you
need
and
have
them
physically
there
in
requirement_6
a
problem
arise
i
see
the
role
connector_4
…
and
that
include
the
rise
of

challenge
to
your

requirement_1
component_5
in
this
day
and
age
handle
requirement_3
connector_data_1
manually
be
a
no
go
nothing
against
but
they
simply
can’t
do
the
anymore
to
really
make
quality_attribute_5
use
of
their
connector_data_1
professional
need
to
embrace
connector_data_1
requirement_1
technology_3
and
their
potential
to
connector_2
clean
pattern_5
and
ready
to
analyze
connector_data_1
have
your
connector_data_1
land
in
the
right
place
nowadays
connector_data_1
flow
in
and
out
of
different
component_3
so
manage
it
from
begin
to
end
can
be
a
rather
complex
component_5
it
be
not
about
connector_6
it
or
transform
it
or
analyze
it
it’s
about
all
of
the
above
in
one
–
and
quite
often
in
a
very
short
time
frame
too
make
your
way
through
the
individual
phase
and
ensure
that
no
one
of
them
remain
neglect
quality_attribute_5
connector_data_1
quality
be
not
enough
you
need
great
the
challenge
in
the
transformation
phase
of
your
connector_data_1
be
achieve
the
right
and
best
possible
quality
of
that
connector_data_1
before
you
move
on
to
derive
your
insight
you
need
to
make
sure
that
your
connector_data_1
be
properly
harmonise
especially
with
regard
to
it
completeness
consistency
and
timeliness
the
last
of
those
three
can
be
particularly
challenge
since
different
component_12
connector_24
connector_data_1
at
different
interval
of
time
and
in
a
multitude
of
technology_4
be
thorough
with
ever
grow
amount
of
connector_data_1
you
should
underestimate
the
fact
that
even
the
slight
error
in
your
initial
connector_data_1
can
have
serious
consequence
for
the
decision
you
make
base
on
it
late
on
quality_attribute_2
connector_data_1
at
the
deep
level
possible
be
thus
something
for
professional
to
embrace
–
and
the
sooner
the
quality_attribute_5
take
drill
down
report
for
example
“the
best
way
to
quality_attribute_2
connector_data_1
be
at
the
technology_8
level
because
then
the
pattern_1
technology_3
can
automatically
merge
it
with
the
high
level
a
need
quality_attribute_2
connector_data_1
directly
at
the
requirement_11
level
for
example
will
open
up
challenge
when
generate
technology_8

drill
down
report
”
quality_attribute_15
yes
please
we
not
want
to
think
about
it
too
often
but
when
it
come
to
requirement_13
and
quality_attribute_16
the
two
practically
go
hand
in
hand
be
ready
to
handle
increasing
amount
of
connector_data_1
on
a
daily
basis
be
already
become
a
must
for
many
requirement_3
professional
out
there
unfortunately
not
many
realize
that
before
they
embrace
a
specific
pattern_1
technology_3
don’t
be
one
of
them
connector_data_1
talent
you
need
to
find
the
best
while
many
organization
still
believe
that
connector_data_1
activity
can
and
should
be
outsource
more
and
more
tend
to
agree
that
have
great
connector_data_1
talent
in
house
be
quite
important
too
in
our
survey
more
than
50%
of
respondent
say
they
have
multiple
people
responsible
for
the
connector_data_1
requirement_1
component_5
and
47%
have
already
create
a
dedicate
position
–
anything
from
connector_data_1
analyst
to
head
of
connector_data_1
technology_6
and
chief
connector_data_1
officer
what
our
component_4
say
adverity
be
able
to
prove
their
excellence
in
leverage
the
requirement_13
need
for
a
highly
agile
requirement_11
their
ability
to
provide
clean
and
harmonise
connector_data_1
