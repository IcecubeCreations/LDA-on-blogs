option

single
component_8
for
all
component_9
one
way
to
design
this
component_10
would
be
to
have
a
single
component_8
that
accomplish
all
this
requirement_9
for
example
connector_5
a
technology_1
which
connector_6
the
order
and
do
all
of
the
component_9
itself
option

introduce
pattern_5
pattern_2
use
component_1
the
other
option
be
to
have
a
component_3
in
between
the
connector_7
orderservice
component_8
and
the
rest
of
the
component_8
when
the
orderservice
connector_8
an
order
it
place
the
connector_data_2
on
the
component_3
the
rest
of
the
component_11
be
independent
component_6
listen
on
the
component_3
a
soon
a
an
order
be
place
on
the
component_3
the
stockservice
component_12
the
order
and
connector_data_4
the
component_2
the
emailservice
connector_9
out
an
to
the
requirement_8
the
smsservice
connector_9
out
an
sm
to
the
component_7
the
packageservice
do
the
require
package
component_9
on
the
item
single
component_11
vs
component_1
if
your
requirement_10
goal
be
to
support
a
few
hundred
or
thousand
of
component_7
then
a
quality_attribute_2
architecture
would
be
a
quality_attribute_3
choice
the
first
architecture
might
be
all
you
need
however
when
we
talk
of
a
large
quality_attribute_4
e
commerce
web
component_10
such
a

technology_2
that
connector_10
million
of
order
in
a
short
time
you
need
a
lot
of
quality_attribute_5
that
s
when
you
go
for
the
second
approach
of
bring
a
component_3
in
advantage
of
use
a
pattern_2
component_3
coding_keyword_2
s
look
at
the
advantage
of
use
pattern_5
connector_1
base
on
a
pattern_2
component_3
a
component_3
improve
quality_attribute_6
coding_keyword_2
s
say
the
smsservice
be
down
for
a
short
time
in
option

since
the
orderservice
directly
invoke
the
smsservice
on
connector_7
an
order
an
sm
cannot
be
connector_11
out
that
might
mean
cancel
the
order
a
all
step
be
part
of
a
single
transaction
failure
of
one
of
the
component_11
would
lead
to
cancellation
of
the
requirement_8
connector_data_2
with
a
need
for
him
to
re
initiate
the
order
—
at
a
late
point
in
time
however
in
the
second
approach
connector_12
pattern_5
connector_1
the
order
connector_data_2
be
place
on
the
component_3
when
the
smsservice
come
back
up
it
will
find
the
order
and
component_9
it
it
can
then
connector_4
out
the
sm
connector_data_5
for
all
it
pending
connector_data_2
a
component_3
provide
quality_attribute_7
suppose
on
any
give
day
that
there
be
a
need
to
connector_4
out


sm
connector_data_1
an
option
with
have
pattern_5
connector_1
be
that
you
can
increase
the
number
of
instance
of
the
smsservice
this
quality_attribute_5
in
the
instance
of
the
component_11
improve
component_13
quality_attribute_7
a
component_3
improve
quality_attribute_8
each
of
the
component_8
component_6
be
loosely
tie
and
have
independent
requirement
it
be
thus
much
easy
to
test
each
one
of
them
preferably
in
isolation
a
component_3
improve
quality_attribute_9
a
component_3
also
improve
component_13
quality_attribute_9
a
the
component_10
be
divide
into
small
component_6
a
component_3
improve
quality_attribute_5
not
only
do
a
component_3
increase
the
instance
of
exist
component_6
it
make
the
component_13
quality_attribute_10
and
able
to
more
component_14
in
the
future
all
you
need
to
do
be
a
component_6
component_15
to
on
the
component_3
and
consum
them
the
component_6
could
be
plug
in
with
minimum
down
time
popular
connector_data_1
component_1
an
extremely
popular
connector_data_1
component_3
technology_3
be
technology_4
different
technology_3
use
different
connector_1
technology_5
but
the
concept
underlie
all
of
them
be
the
same
at
it
core
a
component_3
separate
the
component_8
that
generate
the
from
the
component_14
that
connector_13
the

in
general
if
you
need
a
component_13
that
connector_14
a
very
large
component_7
base
whose
component_16
submit
a
large
number
of
connector_data_6
to
be
component_9
go
for
component_3
base
component_13
summary
in
this

we
look
at
the
fact
that
there
be
two
type
of
architecture
—
pattern_6
and
pattern_5
pattern_6
component_17
have
the
disadvantage
that
one
component_8
be
down
cause
loss
of
component_6
to
the
entire
component_13
pattern_5
component_17
solve
this
problem
by
introduce
an
pattern_7
component_3
to
hold

an
architecture
base
on
pattern_5
connector_1
use
a
component_3
improve
quality_attribute_8
quality_attribute_7
