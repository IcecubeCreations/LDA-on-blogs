connector_1
you
over
the
hump
by
detail
the
inner
work
of
technology_1
technology_2
from
the
dsl
to
connector_2
and
exchange
since
it
creation
by
the
technology_1
in

the
open
component_1
requirement_2
technology_6
technology_1
technology_2
have
become
a
developer
favourite
it
be
recognise
a
a
key
technology_7
to
design
pattern_1
requirement_2
project
and
connector_3
complex
requirement_3
requirement_2
use
requirement_4
this

the
first
part
of
a
series
will
reveal
how
the
technology_6
generate
from
the
domain
specific
technology_8
connector_2
where
exchange
take
place
how
they
be
component_2
accord
to
the
pattern_2
chosen
and
finally
how
requirement_2
occur
introduction
from
a
general
point
of
pattern_3
design
an
requirement_2
architecture
be
not
such
an
obvious
connector_data_1
even
if
the
technology_7
and
the
technology_6
you
want
to
use
be
relatively
easy
to
understand
and
connector_4
the
difficulty
lie
in
the
volume
of
connector_data_2
transformation
to
apply
synchronicity
or
asynchronocity
of
exchange
component_3
run
sequentially
or
in
parallel
and
of
the
pattern_4
of
such
project
run
in
multiple
jvms
in
traditional
technology_3
component_4
we
connector_data_3
from

while
connector_data_4
be
pass
and
or
coding_keyword_1
a
component_5
such
a
payment
or
bill
…
be
a
collection
of

connector_5
be
chain
and
connector_data_4
transport
connector_data_5
sometimes
enlist
within
transaction
but
always
quality_attribute_2
within
the
same
technology_3
container
web
jee
standalone
unless
we
have
to
connector_data_3
external
component_6
or
quality_attribute_1
component_7
component_4
technology_9
etc
most
of
the
connector_data_6
be
do
locally
and
synchronously
if
a
component_5
want
to
be
quality_attribute_3
it
need
to
be
packaged
versioned
in
a
technology_10
and
connector_6
to
the
project
which
will
use
it
this
approach
be
fine
for
project
maintain
by
in
house
development
team
where
cost
can
be
support
by
it
department
but
it
suffer
from
different
issue
and
require
u
most
of
the
time
to
use
the
same
programming
technology_8
or
specific
technology_7
to
interconnect
component_2
pattern_5
iiop
…
container
where
be
quality_attribute_2
figure

pattern_1
to
allow
component_8
to
be
develop
independently
without
such
constraint
the
decouple
must
be
promote
between
the
issuer
of
a
connector_data_7
connector_data_2
from
the
component_5
in
charge
to
connector_7
it
such
a
architecture
paradigm
be
connector_5
component_5
orient
architecture
and
us
a
transport
pattern_6
to
exchange
connector_data_5
between
component_9
one
of
the
immediate
benefit
of
pattern_1
be
to
promote
a
contract
base
approach
to
define
the
component_10
which
be
connector_8
between
component_8
and
manage
them
accord
to
‘governance
rules’
the
pattern_1
approach
have
be
able
to
federate
different
team
tackle
problem
surround
the
development
of
more
complex
project
this
it
transformation
be
require
a
requirement_5
need
to
be
more
agile
to
adapt
to
the
requirement_6
need
connector_data_5
must
be
provide
in
real
time
and
requirement_7
adaption
need
to
be
support
by
exist
component_7
and
back
component_9
while
the
pattern_1
philosophy
have
be
widely
adopt
the

curve
to
master
technology_11
xds
schema
web
component_10
and
requirement_7
component_2
component_11
the
creation
and
requirement_8
of
transversal
team
the
governance
need
to
manage
component_10
and
the
skill
to
acquire
have
certainly
be
factor
in
explain
why
pattern_1
still
struggle
to
be
adopt
by
corporate
requirement_5
moreover
it
department
be
not
only
concern
by
promote
and
manage
the
web
component_10
and
registry
but
also
to
interconnect
exchange
transform
and
validate
connector_data_5
between

component_9
this
requirement_2
aspect
of
it
work
have
be
completely
“underestimated”
when

have
be
elaborate
requirement_3
requirement_2

in

gregory

have
publish
a

connector_5
‘enterprise

where
they
not
only
spend
their

to
describe

they
also
define

to

have
to

the

focus
any
more
on
how
