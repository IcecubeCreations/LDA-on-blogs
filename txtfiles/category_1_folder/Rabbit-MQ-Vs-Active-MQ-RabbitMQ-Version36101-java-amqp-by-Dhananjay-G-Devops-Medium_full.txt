open
component_2
pattern_1
component_3
it
be
connector_1
in
technology_4
connector_2
technology_5
and
be
a
very
popular
choice
when
pattern_1
be
involve
use
technology_1
it
be
possible
to
define
very
complex
connector_data_1
delivery
topology
it
support
both
connector_data_1
persistence
and
pattern_2
with
well
document
behaviour
in
requirement_1
of
e
g
component_4
we’ll
be
test
a
technology_6
rabbit
cluster
to
be
sure
that
connector_3
complete
successfully
we’ll
be
use
pattern_3
confirm
a
rabbit
extension
to
technology_3
instead
of
transaction
“using
technology_7
technology_5
0–9–1
the
only
way
to
guarantee
that
a
connector_data_1
isn’t
lose
be
by
use
transaction
—
make
the
pattern_4
pattern_5
publish
the
connector_data_1
connector_4
in
this
requirement_1
transaction
be
unnecessarily
heavyweight
and
decrease
quality_attribute_1
by
a
factor
of
to
remedy
this
a
confirmation
mechanism
be
introduce
”the
confirmation
be
cluster
wide
the
component_5
be
create
with
a
requirement_2
use
ha
mode
all
see
the
ha
doc
so
this
give
u
pretty
strong
guarantee
that
connector_data_2
will
be
both
connector_1
to
disk
and
replicate
to
the
cluster
“when
will
connector_data_2
be
confirm
for
routable
connector_data_1
the
basic
ack
be
connector_5
when
a
connector_data_1
have
be
connector_6
by
all
the
component_5
for
persistent
connector_data_2
connector_7
to
quality_attribute_2
component_5
this
mean
persist
to
disk
for
mirror
component_5
this
mean
that
all
mirror
have
connector_6
the
connector_data_1
”such
strong
guarantee
be
probably
one
of
the
reason
for
mediocre
requirement_3
a
single
component_6
single
technology_6
give
u
msg
ssent&received
with
a
component_7
quality_attribute_3
of
m
and
connector_8
quality_attribute_3
of
m
this
quality_attribute_4
nicely
a
we
component_6
technology_6
up
to
msg
s
use
connector_8
connector_9
technology_6
run
component_8
each
which
seem
to
be
the
maximum
that
rabbit
can
achieve
let’s
analyze
this
requirement_1
more
closely
here’s
the
test
requirement_4
a
you
can
see
the
connector_9
rat
be
fairly
quality_attribute_5
between
and
msg
s
also
the
component_7
quality_attribute_3
be
mostly
the
same
throughout
the
test
with
the
95th
percentile
at
m
however
the
connector_8
quality_attribute_3
go
up
to
m
for
brief
period
of
time
hence
in
some
requirement_1
connector_data_2
be
already
component_7
even
before
the
connector_8
complete
however
for
most
of
the
time
the
connector_8
quality_attribute_3
be
between
150–250
m
note
that
connector_data_2
be
always
connector_5
and
connector_10
at
the
same
rate
which
would
indicate
that
connector_data_1
connector_11
be
the
limit
factor
when
it
come
to
quality_attribute_1
rabbit’s
requirement_3
be
a
consequence
of
some
of
the
feature
it
offer
for
a
comparison
with
technology_8
see
for
example
this
quora
question
the
technology_1
implementation
of
the
mq
be
again
pretty
straightforward
we
be
use
the
mention
pattern_3
confirm
and
set
the
quality
of
component_9
when
connector_12
so
that
at
most
connector_data_2
be
connector_13
unconfirmed
in
flight
interestingly
connector_11
the
connector_data_2
in
large
pattern_6
doesn’t
affect
overall
quality_attribute_1
much
with
msg
s
when
use
pattern_6
of
and
msg
s
when
we
pattern_6
up
to
connector_data_1
an
important
side
technology_6
technology_1
have
a
great
web
base
console
quality_attribute_6
with
almost
no
setup
which
offer
some
very
quality_attribute_7
insight
into
how
the
component_5
be
perform
technology_9
version
3replication
quality_attribute_8
pattern_7
&
synchronousactivemq
be
one
of
the
most
popular
connector_data_1
pattern_8
in
many
requirement_1
it’s
“the”
pattern_1
component_10
when
use
technology_10
however
it
gain
pattern_2
feature
only
recently
until
version
it
be
possible
to
have
a
pattern_9
setup
use
a
connector_14
component_3
e
g
san
or
a
connector_14
component_11
these
solution
require
either
specialise
hardware
or
be
constrain
by
a
relational
component_11
which
would
have
to
be
cluster
separately
pattern_2
can
be
both
pattern_10
and
pattern_7
in
fact
there’s
a
lot
of
quality_attribute_9
by
set
the
pattern_11
configuration
option
of
the
storage
we
can
control
how
many
technology_6
have
to
connector_9
the
connector_data_1
and
whether
it
should
be
connector_1
to
disk
or
not
before
consider
a
connector_data_3
complete
·
quorum_mem
correspond
to
pattern_10
pattern_2
where
a
connector_data_1
have
to
be
connector_10
by
a
majority
of
component_12
and
component_13
in
memory·
quorum_disk
be
even
strong
require
the
connector_data_1
to
be
connector_1
to
disk·
local_mem
be
pattern_7
pattern_2
where
a
connector_data_1
have
to
be
component_13
in
memory
only
even
if
disk
buffer
be
flush
this
doesn’t
guarantee
connector_data_1
delivery
in
requirement_1
of
a
component_10
restart·
local_disk
be
pattern_7
pattern_2
where
a
connector_data_1
have
to
be
connector_1
to
disk
on
one
serverin
the
test
we’ll
be
mainly
use
quorum_mem
with
a
cluster
of
technology_6
a
we
require
a
quorum
of
technology_6
this
setup
should
be
component_4
tolerant
however
there’s
no
documentation
on
how
component_4
be
handle
and
how
technology_11
behave
in
such
situation
the
technology_9
implementation
u
technology_7
technology_12
connector_data_4
use
the
openwire
technology_13
to
connector_15
to
the
technology_11
component_10
for
connector_8
we
create
a
component_14
with
delivery
mode
set
to
persistent
and
for
connector_16
we
create
a
component_15
with
client_acknowledge
a
we
manually
acknowledge
connector_data_1
delivery
requirement_3
wise
technology_11
do
a
bit
bad
than
technology_1
achieve
at
most
msg
s
with
pattern_10
pattern_2
this
seem
to
be
the
maximum
and
be
achieve
with
technology_6
and
component_6
at
the
high
quality_attribute_1
the
connector_9
rat
be
quite
quality_attribute_5
between
and
msg
s
the
component_7
quality_attribute_3
be
also
quite
tightly
bind
and
at
most
m
more
technology_6
doesn’t
improve
the
connector_data_5
in
fact
they
be
slightly
bad
interestingly
use
the
strong
quorum_disk
guarantee
have
no
big
effect
on
requirement_3
same
a
with
technology_1
in
all
test
connector_3
and
connector_16
happen
at
the
same
rat
hence
the
bottleneck
in
term
of
quality_attribute_1
be
the
connector_11
side
summary
and
conclusion
a
always
which
connector_data_1
component_5
to
choose
quality_attribute_10
on
specific
project
requirement
all
of
the
above
solution
have
some
quality_attribute_7
side
if
you
want
to
have
high
persistence
guarantee
technology_1
ensure
pattern_2
across
the
cluster
and
on
disk
on
connector_data_1
connector_8
it’s
a
very
popular
choice
