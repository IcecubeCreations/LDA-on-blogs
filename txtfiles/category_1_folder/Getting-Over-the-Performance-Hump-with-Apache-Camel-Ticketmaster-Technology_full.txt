over

of

of
one
of
our

base
web
component_4
the
past
year
ticketmaster
have
see
tremendous
growth
in
our
technology_8
tm+
of
which
our
component_4
be
a
key
component_5
with
the
increase
in
traffic
we
have
be
work
hard
to
ensure
acceptable
connector_3
time
for
our
requirement_5
face
component_4
for
the
most
part
our
component_4
have
perform
well
with
a
majority
of
connector_data_2
complete
within
our
desire
duration
however
we
have
occasional
connector_data_2
which
take
long
to
connector_4
at
seemingly
random
interval
so
we
set
about
to
investigate
and
fix
these
worst
requirement_6
requirement_1
spike
csi
consolidate
component_6
of
inventory
be
one
of
our
central
web
component_3
that
act
a
an
abstraction
pattern_4
for
pattern_5
component_7
across
a
potentially
wide
range
of
inventory
component_8
we
use
technology_1
technology_2
‚Äì
for
it
excellent
support
of
requirement_7
requirement_8
pattern_1
‚Äì
to
connector_5
connector_data_2
to
other
web
component_4
through
this
investigation
we
find
several
optimization
to
the
way
we
use
technology_2
that
have
greatly
reduce
garbage
collection
time
and
a
a
connector_data_3
improve
requirement_1
note
that
the
issue
and
solution
present
here
be
discover
use
technology_2



another
thing
to
note
be
that
the
custom
graph
you‚Äôre
see
here
be
all
base
on
ticketmaster‚Äôs
awesome
open_source
graph
solution
metrilyx
which
be
a
visualization
pattern_4
on
top
of
opentsdb
we
first
notice
that
when
connector_6
time
be
slow
our
requirement_4
would
show
no
component_9
activity
for
a
certain
duration
which
often
indicate
that
garbage
collection
be
take
place
we
then
saw
in
our
component_9
technology_9
metric
that
young
generation
garbage
collection
be
take
long
than
expect
we
turn
on
garbage
collection
requirement_4
and
confirm
that
collection
time
directly
correlate
with
the
pause
we
be
see
in
the
component_9
our
problem
identify
the
next
step
be
to
find
out
how
and
why
our
component_9
be
allocate
excessive
amount
of
memory
we
have
have
success
use
java‚Äôs
visualvm
to
diagnose
previous
memory
issue
so
we
begin
by
use
that
technology_10
to
inspect
heap
connector_data_4
although
the
excessive
garbage
collection
time
be
a
connector_data_3
of
memory
usage
the
issue
be
not
a
memory
leak
so
the
problem
connector_data_5
be
not
immediately
apparent
in
a
heap
connector_data_4
we
be
already
suspicious
of
our
technology_2
requirement_8
when
look
at
gc
issue
so
we
drill
down
to
technology_2
connector_data_5
in
a
heap
connector_data_4
to
look
for
clue
the
heap
connector_data_4
be
take
while
we
be
put
load
on
our
component_4
so
although
the
heap
connector_data_4
component_10
temporarily
stop
the
component_9
and
connector_7
a
full
garbage
collection
before
connector_8
the
memory
snapshot
there
be
enough
in
flight
connector_data_2
to
reveal
camel‚Äôs
typemapping
a
a
possible
offender
connector_data_5
of
this
be
very
small
but
they
be
allocate
at
a
high
rate
compare
to
the
overall
rate
of
connector_data_6
so
we
then
begin
to
examine
what
cause
these
connector_data_5
to
be
create
technology_1
technology_2
have
a
very
quality_attribute_3
typeconverter
component_2
for
transform
connector_data_7
which
examine
a
variety
of
different
aspect
of
the
component_8
connector_data_7
to
determine
whether
a
desire
conversion
be
possible
those
aspect
include
type
hierarchy
whether
the
connector_data_7
be
part
of
a
collection
and
more
and
those
attribute
be
inspect
repeatedly
while
technology_2
iterate
through
it
connector_data_8
of
possible
conversion
strategy
this
approach
make
the
follow
possible
exchange
getin
setbody
coding_keyword_3
aslist

requestimpl
requestinterface
body
=
exchange
getin
getbody
requestinterface

however
this
quality_attribute_4
come
at
a
cost
of
high
and
rapid
memory
allocation
every
time
technology_2
try
to
perform
a
conversion
it
connector_9
to
see
if
it
have
attempt
it
before
by
create
a
typemapping
connector_data_7
that
pattern_6
the
relationship
between
the
component_8
and
destination
type
which
be
then
use
a
a
key
for
camel‚Äôs
in
memory
connector_data_1
of
type
converter
over
the
of
a
single
connector_data_6
we
observe
hundred
of
these
connector_data_5
be
create
increasing
the
severity
of
the
issue
be
the
fact
that
technology_2
us
this
conversion
strategy
for
more
than
the
exchange
connector_data_9
technology_2
attempt
to
convert
invocation
in
connector_10
to
it
requirement_9
processor
before
proceed
with
the
invocation
due
to
the
nature
of
this
issue
fix
be
necessarily
on
a
requirement_6
by
requirement_6
basis
we
comb
through
our
technology_2
connector_10
to
find
place
where
we
could
help
technology_2
eliminate
the
need
to
perform
these
type
conversion
technology_11
messagecontentslist
when
use
camel‚Äôs
technology_11
component_5
camel‚Äôs
exchange
be
populate
with
a
technology_11
messagecontentslist
connector_data_7
a
subclass
of
arraylist
which
contain
the
connector_data_6
connector_data_9
we
have
always
be
able
to
bypass
this
wrapper
by
connector_data_6
the
element
directly
from
technology_2
reservationrequestgroup
reserveinventoryrequest
=
exchange
getin
getbody
reservationrequestgroup

due
to
the
relatively
complex
type
hierarchy
of
messagecontentslist
this
connector_data_10
be
quite
expensive
from
a
memory
allocation
perspective
to
streamline
this
connector_data_10
we

a
technology_2
processor
invoke
at
the
begin
of
every
technology_12
connector_data_6
which
extract
the
connector_data_6
element
from
the
connector_data_8
and
connector_11
it
directly
a
the
technology_2
exchange
body
@override
coding_keyword_4
coding_keyword_5

exchange
exchange
throw
exception

messagecontentslist
contentslist

getbody
messagecontentslist

if
contentslist
=
coding_keyword_6
&&
contentslist
size
==

{
in
setbody
contentslist
connector_12

}
}
the
important
point
of
this
fix
be
that
we
be
connector_data_6
the
exchange
body
a
it
actual
type
messagecontentslist
when
this
be
do
the
connector_data_10
be
virtually
free
and
no
typemapping
connector_data_5
be
create
because
of
camel‚Äôs
quality_attribute_4
this
connector_13
be
quality_attribute_5
to
other
place
in
our
where
we
extract
the
connector_data_11
body
but
all
of
those
connector_data_12
be
now
optimize
a
well
assume
the
connector_data_6
type
be
the
same
a
the
actual
body
type
since
csi
be
a
connector_14
component_4
that
make
connector_data_12
to
other
component_6
we
invoke
this
processor
both
when
we

incoming
connector_data_6

the
component_11
and
the
incoming
connector_3
from

in
csi
we
have
many
instance
in
our
connector_10
when
we
need
to
invoke
a
custom
converter
connector_data_7
on
our
exchange
connector_data_9

hi

great

thanks
for
connector_17
your
find
üôÇ
i
be
curious
about
something
when
you
encounter
these
issue
do
you
attempt
to
increase
your
jvm‚Äôs
newsize
to
meet
the
connector_data_7
generation
rate
require
by
your
component_9
i
have
run
into
similar
requirement_1
issue
in
the
past
and
be
able
to
overcome
them
by
make
sure
that
my
technology_9
young
generation
eden
and
survior
space
be
properly
size
for
my
component_13
need
to
avoid
unnecessary
minor
and
major
garbage
collection
i
have
no
doubt
the
connector_18
you
make
will
yield
quality_attribute_1
requirement_1
but
want
to
if
there
be
a
way
to
overcome
this
requirement_1
hump
and
still
be
able
to
rely
on
camel‚Äôs
type

need
and
not

be
hi
vince
thanks
for
your
connector_3
and
suggestion
we
didn‚Äôt
spend
much
time
turn
gc
knob
when
we
start
look
at
the
issue
because
we
want
to
focus
on
find
way
to
reduce
memory
usage
within
the
component_9
with
regard
to
the
typeconverter
technology_14
our
use
requirement_6
be
straightforward
enough
so
that
alter
our
connector_10
to
force
the
most
optimal
usage
of
the
converter
be
a
practical
approach
to
deal
with
the
issue
so
for
more
complex
connector_10
where
these
kind
of
connector_18
not
be
feasible
i
don‚Äôt
have
a
definitive
answer
a
to
whether
similar
improvement
can
be
make
by
adjust
technology_9
setting
alone
but
it
be
possible‚Äìsince
the
connector_data_5
create
by
the
typeconverter
be
very
short
live
the
pause
incur
by
promote
connector_data_5
to
the
survivor
space
be
probably
for
other
connector_data_5
in
the
component_9
prematurely
connector_19
out
of
the
eden
space
by
the
volume
of
technology_2
connector_data_7
in
that
requirement_6
increasing
the
eden
space
could
help
by
delay
garbage
collection
enough
to
coding_keyword_7
other
connector_data_5
die
this
be
effectively
what
happen
when
we
connector_20
our
fix
we
will
consider
this
in
further
effort
and
it
be
very
helpful
to
you
have
