become

current

transmission
between

but
many
thing
we
be
use
to
you
will
feel
that
this
be
a
matter
of
and
you
will
not
think
about
it
in
depth
we
rarely
think
about
the
difference
between
these
technology_1
technology_2
but
in
fact
they
be
not
the
same
therefore
we
run
a
benchmark
test
to
test
several
commonly
use
technology_1
technology_2
to
see
which
technology_2
be
the
fast
when
requirement_2
of
different
size
below
i
will
connector_1
the
connector_data_2
with
everyone
technology_1
be
usually
use
to
transfer
and
requirement_2
large
this
be
a
very
common
scenario
for
connector_data_1
component_3
component_4
run
on
technology_11
or
technology_12
cluster
under
the
give
size
you
can
see
that
there
be
a
clear
difference
in
the
requirement_2
quality_attribute_2
between
different
technology_2
in
the
requirement_3
of
high
quality_attribute_3
small
be
frequently
connector_5
and
requirement_2
so
the
requirement_1
gap
not
be
obvious
at
the
begin
but
if
you
need
to
requirement_2
a
large
number
of
small
frequently
under
very
high
load
the
gap
start
to
increase
pattern_1
and
quality_attribute_4
architecture
often
use
technology_1
to
transfer
such
because
this
be
already
the
de
facto
technology_10
for
web
apis
not
all
technology_1
technology_2
be
connector_6
trensu
how
to
select
the
correct
technology_2
accord
to
the
usage
scenario
be
very
important
hope
this

can
help
you

the

the

be
still
well

and
there
should
be
no
suspense
in
the

rank
second
although

win
the

on

on

it
only
connector_8
the

it
be
also
worth
note
that
although
technology_6
be
the
slow
technology_2
in
this
round
it
requirement_1
in
all
be
very
consistent
although
the
other
three
technology_2
will
occasionally
be
much
fast
than
technology_6
the
analysis
on
other
the
quality_attribute_2
be
quite
even
bad
s
convert
these
number
into

and
see
the

dimension
pattern_2

compare
with
the
large

the
gap
be
relatively
small
this
time
but
it
can
t
be
ignore
conclusion
unfortunately
technology_4
quality_attribute_1
miss
the
championship
with
a
weak
disadvantage
and
this
round
of
technology_5
win
jsonp
be
still
the
third
millennium
and
this
time
technology_6
rush
to
a
late
episode
to
sum
up
requirement_2
quality_attribute_2
be
not
the
only
indicator
of
a
technology_1
technology_2
but
it
be
indeed
very
important
by
run
this
benchmark
we
find
that
no
technology_2
can
beat
the
opponent
on
all
large
perform
well
but
small
be
root
and
vice
versa
if
you
want
to
choose
which
technology_2
from
the
analysis
quality_attribute_2
it
quality_attribute_6
on
your
usage
scenario
if
your
component_2
often
handle
large
technology_1
then
technology_6
should
be
your
dish
technology_5
perform
quite
hard
on
large
if
you
be
mainly
deal
with
small
connector_data_5
such
a
the
initialization
of
a
pattern_3
or
quality_attribute_4
architecture
then
technology_5
be
the
first
choice
technology_6
s
requirement_1
on
small
be
not
satisfactory
if
you
often
handle
both
type
of
then
technology_4
quality_attribute_1
which
rank
second
in
both
round
of
requirement_1
be
more
suitable
for
such
scenario
technology_6
and
technology_5
be
not
very
quality_attribute_5
at
different
size
unless
you
t
consider
the
requirement_2
quality_attribute_2
jsonp
have
nothing
to
praise
it
perform
poorly
on
large
and
small
compare
to
other
technology_2
fortunately
technology_3
will
soon
have
a
requirement_5
technology_1
implementation
i
believe
that
jsonp
s
future
requirement_1
be
still
worth
look
connector_9
to
finally
finish
if
you
be
sensitive
to
the
requirement_2
quality_attribute_2
of
the
technology_1
technology_2
choose
technology_6
for
large
and
technology_5
for
small
and
technology_4
quality_attribute_1
for
both
