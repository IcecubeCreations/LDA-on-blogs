connector_1
most
of
u
have
use
pattern_1
in
one
way
or
another
whether
you’re
buy
a
house

even
something
a
quality_attribute_4

a

primary
role
be
to

represent
either
a
buyer
or
a

but
not
both
at
the
same
time
however
the
pattern_1
concept
be
not
only
use
in
the
real
world
but
also
in
the
digital
world
–
and
we’re
not
talk
about

sell
the
pattern_1
play
an
essential
role
in
requirement_7
component_1
requirement_2
eai
a
it
be
use
to

manage
the

thus
there
be
a
need
to
ensure

by
work
a
a

in

thus
it
minimise
the

between

it

this
make

certain

requirement_13
reduce

if

connector_4
compress
by

the

this
can
be
problematic
for

requirement_13
technology_1
vs

what
should
you
use
here
be
the

you

there

the

of

follow
the

this
be

the

occur
at

there
be

hence
connector_data_4
pick

do
not

the

happen
only
at

also
it

thus
the

technology_1

be
both
