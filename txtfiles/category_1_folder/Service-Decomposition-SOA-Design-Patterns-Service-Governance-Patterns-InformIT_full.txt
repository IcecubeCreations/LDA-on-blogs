when

such

it

generally
preferable
to

a

possible
because
only

however
when

a
a
large
component_10
with
a
correspondingly
large

regardless
of
which

note
another
circumstance
under
which
this
problem
condition
can
occur
be
when

in
this

the

the

essentially
require
that
the
exist
coarse

component_1
be
break
apart
and
it
component_6
reorganize
into

fine
grain
functional
boundary
therefore
the
first
step
be
usually
to
revisit
the
component_1
inventory
blueprint
and
decide
how
the
component_1
can
be
re
component_7
into
multiple
component_1
candidate
a
part
of
this
component_11
capability
candidate
will
also
need
to

if

the

therefore
also
impose

to
also

component_13
that
form

will
likely
need
to
be

to
preserve
the
original
component_1
contract
for
backwards
quality_attribute_5
note
the
concept
behind
this

can
also
be
apply
in

the

component_5

to
be
carefully

together
with
the

component_5

the
preventative
use

can
ease

however
the
connector_data_3
of

can
introduce
a

how
the

a
number
of
reason
one
of
the

of
this
effort
be
that

at

some
preliminary
statistic
show
that
despite
the
increase
in

threshold
the
requirement_4

be
still
excessively

and
there
have
already
be
complaint
about
quality_attribute_10
and
memory
overhead
associate
with
the
component_1
s
invocation
and
participation
a
part
of
the
overall
composition
at
first
the
team
responsible
for
the
requirement_4
component_1
consider
redundant
implementation

to
help
alleviate
this
situation
while
this
would
connector_10
some
of
the
quality_attribute_10
issue
it
would
not
solve
the
memory
overhead
issue
the
team
then
explore
the
option
of
split
the
requirement_5
in
the
requirement_4
component_1
into
two
separate
component_1
from
a
back
end
perspective
there
be
an
opportunity
to

this
in

relatively
clean

manner
currently

however
a

on

their

indicate
that

would
be
more
quality_attribute_8
and
quality_attribute_11
and
the
requirement_4

would
be
light
and
a
more
quality_attribute_12

participant
after
take
all
these
factor
into

the
team
feel
that
it
make
sense
to
break
off

into
a

appropriately
connector_7

the
first
challenge
they
face
be
that
the

be

by
many
component_12

if
