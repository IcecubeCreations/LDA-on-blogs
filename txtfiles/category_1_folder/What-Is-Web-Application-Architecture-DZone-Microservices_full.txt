design
a

your
need
a
well
craft
blueprint
so
it
could
work
a
effectively
a
possible
a
for
the
ui
ux
design
step
this
be
connector_3
prototyping
but
in
this
requirement_7
we
use
the
term
“web
component_1
architecture
”
in
this

people
from
designveloper
will
discus
this
topic
and
introduce
you
to
other
relate
knowledge

what
be
web
component_1
architecture
basically
web
component_1
architecture
be
a
technology_3
or
some
people
might
connector_data_1
it
a
mechanism
that
state
it
external
and
internal
component_3
the
relationship
and
connector_4
between
those
component_1
component_4
technology_4
component_5
component_6

and
component_2
this
way
web
experience
will
be
enable
and
can
be
use
by
component_7
it
primary
mission
be
to
make
sure
that
all
component_4
work
simultaneously
and
be
a
strong
base
to
build
and
set
up
everything
afterward
many
developer
might
skip
the
step
of
create
this
blueprint
and
develop
the
web
component_1
right
away
nevertheless
if
you
want
to
build
a
quality_attribute_2
technology_2
that
have
high
quality_attribute_3
and
be
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_5
and
quality_attribute_6
web
component_1
architecture
be
not
something
you
should
ignore
all
stakeholder
include
developer
component_7
or
even
end
component_6
should
join
in
the
plan
of
web
component_1
architecture
to
customize
it
a
per
expectation
a
web
component_1
architecture
component_4
web
component_1
architecture
have
various
type
of
component_4
and
they
could
be
divide
into

category
which
be
component_6
component_4
and
structural
component_3
component_6
component_4
be
responsible
for
create
a
web
application’s
and
experience
in
other
word
these
component_4
be
connector_5
to
the
display
setting
and
configuration
of
your
web
component_1
they
include
several
element
such
a
requirement_8
statistical
connector_data_2
connector_data_3
element
layout
activity
track
configuration
set
etc
on
the
other
hand
structural
component_4
play
a
vital
role
in
construct
the
requirement_9
of
a
certain
web
component_1
thus
these
be
the
component_4
that
allow
component_8
to
connector_6
with
the
web
component_9
simply
put
there
be

of
them

the
web
component_1
component_10
develop
by
technology_5
technology_6
technology_1
net
this
one
apply
and
support
requirement_10
component_11
or
rule
and
restriction
so
that
web
component_12
could
run
automatically

the
component_2
component_10
it
component_13
connector_7
and
provide
connector_data_4
that
be
need
for
operate
the
web
component_1

the
browser
component_8
will
connector_8
and
connector_6
with
the
web
component_1
via
this
component_14
cs
technology_7
and
technology_8
be
the

programming
technology_9
use
to
develop
this
component_3
b
type
of
web
component_1
architecture
quality_attribute_7
on
various
factor
such
a
purpose
the
choice
of
component_1
component_11
it

feature
a
well
a
the
business’s
priority
developer
will
pick
up

of
the

and
trend
type
below
to
start
connector_data_5
the
web
component_9
architecture

single
component_15
component_1
they
work
a
desktop
component_1
that
accord
to
wikipedia
“can
connector_6
with
the
web
browser
by
rewrite
the
current
web
component_15
with
connector_data_2
from
the
web
component_10
instead
of
the
default
of
the
browser
loading
entire
component_15
”
this
way
component_16
can
enjoy
a
quality_attribute_8
requirement_11
a
the
web
component_1
won’t
create
any
interruption
at
the
moment
this
be
the
most
popular
web
component_1
architecture

pattern_3
architecture
this
be
the
practice
of
divide
a
web
component_1
into
small
autonomous
unit
and
develop
each
of
them
separately
with
this
type
of
architecture
developer
can
launch
their
technology_2
fast
because
it
be
lightweight
and
have
one
requirement_9
at
a
time

serverless
architecture
when
choose
this
type
of
architecture
the
need
to
manage
infrastructure
be
no
long
there
all
you
need
to
focus
on
be
develop
the
requirement_9

some
common
technology_10
to
create
web
component_1
architecture
technology_1
web
component_1
architecture
this
practice
allow
u
to
combine
various
technology_1
technology_3
or
technology_11
to
develop
the
web
component_9
no
matter
how
complex
or
quality_attribute_9
it
be
thanks
to
this
characteristic
it
be
prefer
to
use
in
multitier
project
or
in
the
requirement_12
development
environment
requirement_4
base
architecture
all
connector_data_2
and
will
be
component_13
on
a
requirement_4
or
local
component_10
a
a
connector_data_6
different
component_17
of
an
environment
can
connector_6
with
one
another
even
though
they
be
not
directly
connector_9
technology_12
this
be
a
place
connector_10
component_18
connector_data_7
until
the
connector_11
can
reach
them
developer
can
use
it
to
make
thing
appear
or
have
them
do
in
order
when
build
pattern_4
component_5
technology_13
web
component_10
architecture
handle
cross
component_19

technology_14
pattern_1
on
one
component_20
be
one
of
it
most
significant
capability
besides
that
you
don’t
even
need
component_21
for
connector_10
connector_data_2
if
use
this
architecture
too
technology_6
web
component_1
architecture
this
architecture
seem
to
be
a
promise
one
when
it
require
le
but
offer
strong
protection
quick
development
and
quality_attribute_9
quality_attribute_10
angular
j
this
technology_3
can
work
both
a
a
component_19
a
well
a
a
technology_3
for
technology_7
and
typescript
developer
use
build
block
connector_3
ngmodules
to
connector_data_5
such
architecture
size
reduce
and
lazy
loading
be

most
significant
advantage
of
this
web
component_1
architecture
technology_5
web
technology_3
developer
prefer
this
programming
technology_9
a
it
be
concise
easy
to
understand
and
quality_attribute_8
for
quality_attribute_10
furthermore
technology_5
be
also
suitable
for
newbie
whether
this
be
their
time
use
technology_5
or
the
first
time
they
work
on
a
certain
project
technology_15
technology_3
together
with
high
quality_attribute_3
and
a
quicker
design
component_22
technology_15
be
consistent
and
can
help
the
creation
of
pattern_5
to
identify
element
and
configure
them
nevertheless
it
also
allow
connector_12
and
quality_attribute_11
and
many
more
to
say
we
hope
you
have
acquire
some
connector_data_4
