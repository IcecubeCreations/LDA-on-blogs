how

it

an
essential
skill
for

even
though

it

you

in

one
of
the

advantage
when
compare

connector_data_2
technology_4
be
the

this

we
can
see
his

here
such
a
his

in
essence
technology_1
connector_data_1
be
nothing
more
than
a

which
be
why
technology_1
connector_data_5
be
often
connector_6

a
there
be
no

in

first
of

we

that

such
a
encoding

technology_1
connector_data_5
and
doesn

have
any

create

here
we

then
we

up
two
connector_data_9
and
put
it
in
a
a
third
property
of
our

ultimately
we
re
transform
sampleobject
to
a
technology_1
document
connector_9
the
tojsonstring
and
connector_2
it
down
to
a
to
run
this
we

that

this
solution

a

we

in
the
root
of
our
package
the
content
of
the
will
be
a

with
all
the
property
that
we
ve
put
in
{
name
stackabuser
connector_data_8
hey
what
s
up
age
35}
great
we
have
our
first
experience
with
the
technology_1
technology_4
and
we
have
successfully
serialize
a
technology_7
connector_data_1
to
it
and
connector_5
it
down
to
the
now
with
a
slight
modification
of
our
component_10
we
can
connector_4
the
technology_1
connector_data_1
from
the
and

to
the

either
completely

it
s
important
to
note
that
the
requirement_2
an
connector_data_1
and
we
have
to
explicitly
cast
it
to
if
you
have
a
malformed
or
corrupt
technology_1
document
you
ll
connector_8
an

dig

even
though
technology_2

be
useful
it
doesn
t
allow
u
to
use
custom

additional
s
assume
we
have

}
s
take
the
technology_1
document
that
we
use
a
an
example
in
the

put
it
in
the

}
our
connector_data_12
would
be
to
deserialize
this
connector_data_1
from
a
to
an
instance
of
the
person
s
try
to
do
this
use
quality_attribute_1
technology_2
first
modify

the

we

the

to

the

connector_data_3
ignore
the

isn

a

a
we

have
it
in

and
want
it
to

to
the

the
issue
here
be
relate
to
the
inner
connector_data_6
of
technology_16
technology_17
it
derive
property
name
from
getters
remove
the
first
part
of
them
in
the
requirement_6
of
getage
and
getname
it
work
perfectly
but
with
ismarried
it
doesn
t
and
assume
the
must
be
connector_6
married
instead
of
ismarried
a
brutish
but
work
option
we
can
resolve
this
issue
simply
by
rename
the
getter
to
isismarried
s
go
ahead
and
try
to
do
this
no
more
exception
be
pop
up
and
we
see
the

connector_data_3
person{name=

although
the
connector_data_3
be
satisfy
there
s
a
quality_attribute_3
way
around
this
than
another
be
to
each
of
your
boolean
getters
we
can
achieve
the
same
connector_data_3
by
an
annotation
to
the
ismarried
@jsonproperty
value=
ismarried
boolean
ismarried
{
ismarried
}
this
way
we
re
explicitly
tell
technology_16
the
name
of
the
and
it
doesn
t
have
to
guess
it
could
be
especially
useful
in
requirement_6
where
the
be
name
totally
different
from
getters
conclusion
technology_1
be
a
lightweight
text
base
technology_4
that
allow
u
to
represent
connector_data_5
and
transfer
them
across
the
web
or
component_6
in
the

there
be
no
requirement_3
support
for

manipulation
in

however
there
be
multiple
that
provide
this
requirement_4
in
this
we
have
cover
the

quality_attribute_1

technology_16
show
the
strength

weakness
of
each
one
of
them
work

you
should
keep
in

the
nuance
of

you
