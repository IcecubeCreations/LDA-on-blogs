connector_3
create
one
large
monolithic
component_2
no

make
sense
for
several
reason
large
component_3
can
be
overwhelm
and
slow
for
your
team
to
develop
test
and
quality_attribute_4
large
component_3
force
you
to
connector_4
to
a
technology_3
technology_4
and
make
it
very
difficult
to
adapt
quality_attribute_5
large
component_3
mean
create
multiple
instance
of
the
entire
environment
instead
of
quality_attribute_5
a
small
piece
the
pattern_1
architectural
pattern_2
be
a
great
solution
for
these
problem
the
concept
be
simple—break
your
component_2
into
multiple
independent
component_2
each
with
a
clear
purpose
the
component_3
talk
to
each
other
use
technology_5
over
pattern_3
or
a
connector_data_3
component_6
each
of
these
component_3
can
be
connector_1
in
whatever
technology_6
be
best
for
it

developer
and
ides
be
happy
because
they
be
work
with
a
small
base
and
they
have
more
quality_attribute_6
to
make
connector_5
to
their
more
quality_attribute_7
component_2
each
component_2
can
be
pattern_4
quality_attribute_1
or
update
independently
to
match
demand

define
by

separate
component_2
one
of
the
major
strength
of
pattern_1
be
the
ability
to
choose
which
technology_6
runtime
you
want
to
use
for
each
component_2
for
this
sample
we
decide
to
use
technology_7
for
our
catalog
backened
due
to
it’s
non

pattern_5
i
o
it’s
ability
to
handle
many
connector_data_4
and
for
the
use
of
a
non

component_7
for
our
catalog
of
item
for
the
order
we
decide
on
technology_8
technology_9
for
it
ability

and
take
advantage
of
a
