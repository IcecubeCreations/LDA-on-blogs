vs

—
what
to
choose
with
the
constantly
gain
enthusiasm
towards
the
development
of
component_2
for
requirement_2
component_3
there
have
be
a
myriad
of
question
&
lot
of
confusion
over
cross
component_1
vs
requirement_1
vs
hybrid
component_4
development
approach
particularly
from
developer
the
lack
of
enough
end
to
end
resource
for
choose
the
right
requirement_2
component_4
approach
have
continue
to
serve
a
a
major
barrier
to
find
a
lasting
solution
for
the
io
vs
technology_1
banter
even
so
give
that
both
component_5
be
critical
for
a
fruitful
requirement_2
component_4
strategy
cross
component_1
requirement_2
component_4
development
might
seem
to
be
the
best
answer
for
this
debate
today
it
be
no
long
tenable
to
simply
build
an
component_4
that
target
only
one
component_1
—diversity
be
the
key
we
need
multi
component_1
component_2
that
can
support
both
technology_1
and
iphone
smartphones
and
ensure
no
one
be
leave
out
requirement_1
requirement_2
appsa
requirement_1
component_4
be
usually
connector_1
in
one
programming
technology_2
for
a
particular
operate
component_6
compare
to
other
type
of
technology_3
requirement_1
component_2
offer
consistent
requirement_3
and
be
time
more
quality_attribute_1
quality_attribute_2
on
the
component_1
an
component_4
be
develop
for
specific
programming
technology_2
be
use
for
io
it’s
mainly
technology_4
and
technology_5
while
technology_1
developer
connector_1
in
technology_6
or
technology_7
go
requirement_1
be
a
dream
of
a
lot
of
component_4
owner
but
not
all
can
afford
it
the
big
reason
be
to
run
the
component_4
on
multiple
component_1
it
require
develop
and
maintain
an
component_4
for
each
component_1
separately
and
it
cost
a
bomb
to
develop
a
requirement_1
component_4
for
multiple
component_5
to
many
requirement_4
people
simply
put
requirement_1
component_2
mean
build
two
different
component_2
with
different
set
of
for
each
component_1
technology_1
&
io
more
development
time
equal
more
development
cost
consider
build
a
requirement_1
component_7
if
component_8
never
use
your
technology_3
before
a
a
web
component_7
for
instance
and
this
be
the
first
time
you
be
make
an
component_4
and
you
want
to
impress
them
with
the
best
experience
possible
you
want
to
take
advantage
of
component_3
specific
feature
—
camera
gps
etc
the
component_4
be
go
to
be
use
by
a
large
number
of
people
or
have
complex
feature
that
would
be
a
nightmare
to
bugfix
be
a
cross
component_1
component_4
and
impossible
to
load
a
a
hybrid
oneyou
want
to
connector_2
a
base
of
daus
daily
active
component_8
in
order
to
connector_2
vc
investor
to
fund
the
technology_3
so
the
component_4
need
to
be
a
intuitive
and
easy
to
a
possiblepros
of
build
a
requirement_1
apphigh
speedthanks
to
the
fact
that
requirement_1
requirement_2
component_9
don’t
have
a
that’s
too
complex
they
tend
to
work
fast
than
other
component_2
many
component_4
element
be
display
quickly
because
they
be
preloaded
beforehand
work
well
offlinenative
component_2
work
with
no
issue
even
when
there’s
no
internet
connector_3
obviously
that
make
such
an
component_7
way
more
convenient
to
component_10
a
they
can
connector_4
all
the
feature
on
the
go
or
on
the
airplane
when
there’s
no
connector_5
con
of
build
a
requirement_1
appno
quality_attribute_3
codeif
a
developer
want
to
create
requirement_1
component_2
both
for
technology_1
and
io
he
would
have
to
develop
two
separate
requirement_1
component_2
what
we
discus
obviously
that
would
take
a
lot
more
time
and
effort
than
develop
one
cross
component_1
requirement_2
component_4
with
a
quality_attribute_3
codebase
or
a
hybrid
component_4
with
a
connector_6
backend
involve
more
talentas
requirement_1
component_2
be
technology_2
specific
to
the
core
requirement_5
usually
struggle
to
find
a
skilled
developer
to
connector_7
off
develop
a
requirement_1
component_4
back
to
back
when
compare
requirement_1
component_4
vs
cross
component_1
component_4
if
a
requirement_5
want
to
reach
out
to
a
wide
audience
they
technology_8
have
to
hire
two
development
team
for
requirement_1
component_4
development
whereas
it
could
have
go
with
one
in
the
requirement_6
of
cross
component_1
requirement_1
component_4
examplesmost
of
the
component_2
smartphone
component_10
install
on
a
daily
basis
be
requirement_1
here
be
some
of
the
most
prominent
example
of
what
requirement_1
component_4
development
be
capable
of
mapsgoogle
connector_data_1
be
a
requirement_1
component_4
quality_attribute_4
for
both
technology_1
and
io
both
component_2
have
common
feature
—
street
pattern_1
turn
by
turn
navigation
transit
connector_data_2
etc
a
a
requirement_1
component_4
connector_data_1
be
able
to
profit
from
the
device’s
build
in
feature
while
it
do
need
online
connector_4
to
be
use
to
it
full
requirement_3
connector_data_1
can
be
display
in
an
offline
mode
a
well
linkedinlinkedin
be
another
example
of
an
component_7
that
switch
from
a
hybrid
to
a
requirement_1
component_4
the
quality
decrease
when
it
come
to
requirement_3
slow
render
quality_attribute_5
and
storage
space
issue
due
to
the
increasing
amount
of
daily
active
component_10
force
linkedin
to
consider
requirement_1
component_2
a
a
development
vector
hybrid
requirement_2
appshybrid
component_2
be
the
golden
mean
between
requirement_1
and
web
component_7
they
consist
of
two
part
—
backend
and
a
requirement_1
viewer
that
can
be
download
to
display
the
backend
in
a
web
pattern_1
unlike
web
component_2
hybrid
requirement_2
component_2
don’t
require
a
browser
for
connector_4
and
can
take
advantage
of
any
plugin
and
the
component_11
of
a
component_3
they
be
cheap
in
development
than
requirement_1
component_2
but
their
requirement_3
be
mostly
slow
a
well
consider
build
a
hybrid
component_7
if
you
want
the
component_4
to
run
on
different
component_5
but
you
don’t
have
the
time
to
develop
a
cross
component_1
solutionyou
want
to
make
use
of
the
device’s
requirement_1
feature
—
camera
gps
etc
you
want
to
quality_attribute_6
a
web
component_7
across
component_7
storespros
of
build
a
hybrid
appfaster
developmentdue
to
the
fact
that
the
component_4
u
the
same
backend
for
all
component_1
it
doesn’t
take
too
much
time
to
create
a
hybrid
component_4
basically
all
a
developer
have
to
do
be
to
create
a
requirement_1
shell
to
pattern_1
the
that
have
already
be
develop
a
a
web
component_4
keep
in
mind
however
that
hybrid
component_2
with
lot
of
feature
can
be
even
more
time
connector_8
so
it’s
quality_attribute_7
to
keep
it
quality_attribute_8
quality_attribute_8
maintenancedue
to
the
fact
that
hybrid
component_2
be
base
on
web
technology_9
they
be
easy
to
maintain
compare
to
requirement_1
vs
hybrid
component_2
that
be
more
complex
in
term
of
cod
con
of
build
a
hybrid
appimpossible
to
connector_4
offlinedue
to
the
fact
that
hybrid
component_2
be
essentially
web
base
they
don’t
work
without
the
internet
connector_5
moreover
a
all
the
element
of
the
component_4
have
to
be
load
the
requirement_3
quality_attribute_5
be
generally
slow
needle
to
say
this
impose
a
ton
of
connector_5
limitation
on
the
component_7
component_8
connector_5
issue
be
a
significant
difference
between
requirement_1
and
hybrid
component_4
development
o
inconsistenciesdue
to
the
fact
that
hybrid
component_2
connector_9
a
codebase
certain
feature
might
be
support
by
technology_1
and
not
display
on
an
io
component_3
and
vice
versa
it
take
more
test
sprint
to
identify
inconsistency
and
a
ton
of
modification
to
fix
these
issue
hybrid
component_4
exampleswhile
at
first
glance
hybrid
component_2
might
seem
nothing
but
a
cheap
fix
in
reality
a
fair
connector_9
of
top
social
component_9
be
in
fact
hybrid
let’s
take
a
look
at
most
popular
hybrid
component_4
example
gmailgmail
be
the
most
popular
technology_10
in
the
world
at
the
moment
it
have
be
a
web
technology_11
component_7
for
a
long
time
gmail’s
requirement_2
component_7
be
a
powerful
combination
of
the
requirement_1
web
component_7
infrastructure
and
requirement_1
component_7
the
hybrid
component_7
for
gmail
be
a
solid
in
it
requirement_3
a
it
pc
version
the
high
customization
level
and
dozen
of
feature
prove
that
hybrid
component_7
can
be
a
reward
a
a
requirement_1
one
in
the
long
run
instagramusing
the
hybrid
development
approach
allow
developer
to
create
an
component_4
that
support

while
the
technology_12
fee
can’t
be
refresh
when
there’s
no
internet
connector_5
you
can
still
connector_4
connector_data_3
that
have
be
load
already
a
of
now
technology_12
have
over
a

this

the
convenience
and

a

when
