base
on
the
micro
component_1
pattern_2
have
gain
quite
some
popularity
in
recent
year
micro
component_2
have
emerge
a
a
solution
to
large
unwieldy
monolithic
component_3
this
design
attempt
to
solve
the
problem
that
emerge
when
your
codebase
grow
beyond
a
certain
size
and
it
become
increasingly
difficult
to
maintain
small
quality_attribute_1
component_2
be
bear
out
of
the
necessity
to
quality_attribute_1
rapidly
while
still
keep
your

netflix

and
spotify
be
some
of
the
large
and
more
interest
player
move
towards
this
type
of
pattern_2
let’s
explore
why
what
be
pattern_1
define
pattern_1
be
tricky
requirement_1
there
be
no
set
requirement
or
specification
that
your
codebase
should
meet
in
order
to
be
consider
“micro
”
instead
developer
and
architect
must
adhere
to
a
set
of
general
idea
in
order
to
come
up
with
a
component_4
that
work
for
them
the
pattern_3
architectural
style
be
an
approach
to
develop
a
single
component_3
a
a
suite
of
small
component_1
each
run
in
it
own
component_5
and
connector_1
with
lightweight
mechanism
often
an
technology_1
resource

two
key
idea
that
must
be
keep
in
mind
while
design
these
component_1
loose
couple
and
high
pattern_4
these
admittedly
sound
even
more
buzz
word
but
allow
me
to
elaborate
loose
couplingideally
you
want
the
component_2
to
have
little
to
no
dependence
amongst
one
another
component_2
should
be
changable
and
quality_attribute_3
independently
without
require
connector_2
to
other
part
of
the
component_4
component_1
must
connector_3
only
the
connector_data_2
that
be
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
the
component_6
that
connector_4
their
connector_data_3
from
bind
too
tightly
to
them
this
make
it
easy
to
roll
out
connector_2
in
the
future
high
cohesionhigh
pattern_4
can
be
think
of
a
a
corollary
to
loose
couple
pattern_4
refer
to
the
idea
that
all
the
component_7
pertain
a
particular
component_8
in
the
component_4
should
be
bundle
together
in
a
single
place
this
make
it
easy
to
modify
the
behavior
of
a
portion
of
the
component_4
since
it
minimize
the
number
of
place
where
need
to
be
update
it’s
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
there
be
nothing
about
a
monolithic
connector_data_4
that
would
stop
you
from
apply
the
same
principle
quality_attribute_4
be
encourage
in
any
codebase
large
codebases
have
traditionally
rely
on
the
concept
of
connector_5
and
technology_3
in
order
to
enforce
a
similar
degree
of
logical
separation
pattern_1
go
one
step
further
by
make
these
boundary
more
obvious
and
slightly
hard
to
breach
induce
factorsin
order
to
understand
micro
component_1
you
should
understand
that
there
be
some
shortfall
in
a
traditional
monolithic
connector_data_4
which
be
the
reason
that
developer
be
shift
towards
more
loosely
couple
component_1
technology_4
diversityas
your
component_3
grow
in
size
so
do
the
number
of
feature
it
connector_6
and
by
extension
the
number
of
technological
requirement
impose
on
your
component_4
for
example
some
part
of
your
component_3
demand
a
specific
technology_3
connector_7
in
a
specific
technology_5
which
happen
to
be
the
right
technology_6
for
it
part
of
your
component_3
benefit
from
the
statically
type
quality_attribute_5
nature
of
technology_7
while
other
portion
be
le
demand
similarly
the
optimal
component_9
very
well
vary
across
the
component_3
this
also
provide
a
quality_attribute_6
opportunity
to
experiment
with
technology_5
and
technology_8
in
a
limit
scope
experimentation
in
a
way
become
le
risky
since
it
be
limit
to
only
a
handful
of
component_2
which
can
be
revert
back
to
their
original
state
fairly
quickly
in
general
in
a
monolithic
component_3
the
technology_6
you
choose
typically
end
up
be
the
“least
common
denominator
”
rather
than
optimize
for
the
connector_data_5
at
hand
there
be
however
an
downside
to
all
of
this
in
practice
it
be
possible
for
the
large
number
of
technology_8
and
technology_5
be
employ
by
different
component_2
to
itself
turn
into
a
mess
move
developer
between
team
typically
one
team
per
component_1
can
be
a
nightmare
if
they
aren’t
familiar
with
the
technology_9
interestingly
spotify
—
a
major
advocate
of
the
pattern_3
architecture
pattern_2
—
have
a
zero
tolerance
requirement_2
when
it
come
to
the
variety
of
technology_5
use
on
their
production
component_1
essentially
every
component_1
be
quality_attribute_7
to
production
must
be
connector_7
in
technology_7
and
technology_7
alone
thus
invalidate
this
argument
nevertheless
technological
diversity
be
a
key
advantage
to
a
pattern_3
base
design
even
if
only
use
sparingly
fault
tolerancethe
idea
of
fault
tolerance
be
strongly
relate
to
the
concept
of
loose
couple
discuss
previously
team
should
focus
on
make
each
component_1
a
independent
a
possible
this
ensure
that
if
one
component_1
go
down
it
doesn’t
affect
the
other
component_2
except
for
the
one
immediately
quality_attribute_8
on
it
a
an
end
component_10
your
experience
be
degrade
and
limit
but
the
component_3
should
still
remain
functional
this
be
in
most
requirement_3
far
quality_attribute_6
than
crash
the
entire
component_3
a
an
example
consider

coding_keyword_1
assume
that
be
compose
of
a
couple
of
different
component_1
each
handle
a
crucial
part
of
the
component_3
inventory
component_1
responsible
for
manage
all
the
connector_data_6
that
sell
a
well
a
their
requirement_4
levelsorder
component_1
responsible
for
take
requirement_5
order
and
dispatch
the
itemrecommendation
component_1
responsible
for
come
up
with
recommendation
about
technology_10
that
a
requirement_5
be
interest
inthis
be
by
no
mean
a
complete
or
quality_attribute_9
description
of
how
be
pattern_5
but
it
work
well
for
this
example
consider
the
scenario
where
the
recommendation
component_1
decide
to
fly
off
the
handle
and
crash
on
u
now
in
a
traditional
monolithic
component_3
this
might
lead
to
the
shutdown
of

yikes
in
the
present
requirement_3
however
a
component_10
be
serve
up
a
component_11
without
any
recommendation
while
other
part
of
the
component_3
continue
to
a
well
a
sub
optimal
experience
but
still
functional
not
bad
scalabilitythe
issue
of
quality_attribute_10
be
an
immensely
important
one
for
a
fast
grow
requirement_6
when
you
have
a
single
gigantic
component_3
not
all
part
of
it
be
equally
load
intensive
some
be
responsible
for
more
passive
mundane
thing
such
a
serve
coding_keyword_2
connector_data_2
while
others
be
more
intensive
require
a
lot
of
component_9
connector_8
and
or
computing
power
the
problem
with
a
monolithic
codebase
then
be
that
regardless
of
the
different
type
of
it’s
conduct
you
need
to
quality_attribute_1
the
entire
component_3
up
and
down
base
on
need
since
this
isn’t
an
quality_attribute_9
representation
of
the
actual
demand
on
your
component_4
it
lead
to
huge
amount
of
waste
computing
power
and
resource
this
be
one
of
the
issue
pattern_1
attempt
to
solve
because
requirement_7
be
separate
into
different
“boxes”
each
component_12
can
be
quality_attribute_1
up
or
down
independently
without
affect
the
rest
of
the
component_4
and
so
you
end
up
go
from
a
component_4

look

ease

coding_keyword_1
talk
a
little
bit
about
how
quality_attribute_7
these
component_2
would
work
give
the
sheer
number
of
component_2
be
quality_attribute_7
this
seem
a
bit
a
counter
argument
at
first
however
the
key
thing
to
remember
be
that
any
connector_9
in
the
behavior
of
a
particular
part
of
the
component_3
usually
require
a
connector_9
in
one
and
preferably
only
one
part
of
the
component_3
isolate
away
into
a
pattern_3
in
this
requirement_3
when
you
have
a
small
connector_9
this
difference
boil
down
to
redeploy
a
small
component_1
versus
redeploy
a
million
line
component_3
in
practice
monolithic
component_13
be
seldom
redeploy
at
that
rate
a
a
connector_data_7
connector_2
usually
build
up
between
release
lead
to
big
more
comprehensive
release
the
sheer
number
of
connector_2
be
quality_attribute_7
could
itself
be
a
potential
risk
but
a
always
there
be
a
tradeoff
involve
here
although
pattern_1
allow
you
to
quality_attribute_7
connector_2
rapidly
they
necessitate
all
component_14
of
your
component_1
to
be
in
pattern_6
with
your
release
this
could
be
trivial
if
the
number
of
component_2
quality_attribute_8
on
your
component_2
be
small
but
in
a
large
organization
this
not
always
be
the
requirement_3
a
compromise
be
reach
and
you
very
well
end
up
support
previous
version
of
your
pattern_1
for
component_14
that
quality_attribute_8
on
them
until
they
connector_10
around
to
upgrade
in
this
coding_keyword_3
i
have
only
scratch
the
surface
there
be
several
other
idea
that
you
should
consider
before
go
down
the
pattern_3
connector_11
concept
connector_data_3
decentralization
and
component_1
discovery
be
central
to
a
quality_attribute_11
architecture
and
require
more
study
maybe
a
future
coding_keyword_3
i’m
fairly
to
this
style
of
development
myself
if
there
be
something
i’ve
leave
out
or
misrepresent
please
do
coding_keyword_1
me
in
the

if
this
be
a
topic
you
want
to
more
about
here
be
some
resource
that
i
find
useful
while
come
up
with
this
coding_keyword_3
