pattern_1
component_1
it
be
originally
develop
at
linkedin
corporation
and
late
on
become
a
part
of
technology_1
project
technology_2
be

by
it
design
component_9
and
replicate

requirement_11
component_3
technology_1
technology_2
differ
from
traditional
pattern_1
component_1
in
it
be
design
a
a
quality_attribute_1
component_1
which
be
very
easy
to
quality_attribute_7
out
it
offer
high
quality_attribute_8
for
both
publish
and
subscribe
it
support
multi
pattern_6
and
automatically
balance
the
component_10
during
failure
it
persist
connector_data_2
on
disk
and
thus
can
be
use
for
pattern_7
consumption
such
a
technology_17
in
addition
to
real
time
component_8
in
this

i
will
highlight
the
architecture
point
feature
and
characteristic
of
technology_1
technology_2
that
will
help
u
to
understand
how
technology_2
be
quality_attribute_9
than
traditional

reason
not
to
put
an

connector_data_1
intensive
component_11
require
high
requirement_2
+
low
quality_attribute_10
achieve
extreme
quality_attribute_7
with
the
low

more
i
will
compare
the
traditional
connector_data_3
component_6
technology_18
and
technology_1
technology_19
characteristic
with
technology_2
and
discus
certain
scenario
where
technology_2
be
a
quality_attribute_9
solution
than
traditional
connector_data_3
component_6
in
the
last
section
we
will
explore
a
work
sample
component_8
to
showcase
technology_2
usage
a
connector_data_3
component_6
complete
component_12
of
the
sample
component_8
be
quality_attribute_11
on
technology_20
a
detail
discussion
around
sample
component_8
be
in
the
last
section
of
this

architecture
firstly
i
want
to
introduce
the
basic
concept
of
technology_2
it
architecture
consist
of
the
follow
component_13
a
connector_12
of
connector_data_2
of
a
particular
type
be
define
a
a
topic
a
connector_data_3
be
define
a
a
connector_data_4
of
byte
and
a
topic
be
a
category
or
fee
name
to
which
connector_data_2
be
publish
a
component_14
can
be
anyone
who
can
publish
connector_data_2
to
a
topic
the
publish
connector_data_2
be
then
component_15
at
a
set
of
component_16
connector_13
pattern_9
or
technology_2
cluster
a
component_17
can
subscribe
to
one
or
more
topic
and
connector_14
the
publish
connector_data_2
by
connector_15
connector_data_1
from
the
pattern_9
figure

technology_2
component_14
component_17
and
pattern_9
environment
component_14
can
choose
their
favorite
serialization
to
encode
the
connector_data_3
content
for
quality_attribute_12
the
component_14
can
connector_16
a
set
of
connector_data_2
in
a
single
publish
connector_data_5
follow
example
show
how
to
create
a
component_14
to
connector_16
connector_data_3
sample
component_14

component_14

component_14
…
connector_data_3

getbytes
set
=
messageset
connector_data_3
component_14
connector_16
“topic1”
set
for
subscribe
topic
a
component_17
first
create
one
or
more
connector_data_3
connector_17
for
the
topic
the
connector_data_2
publish
to
that
topic
will
be
evenly
quality_attribute_1
into
these
connector_12
each
connector_data_3
connector_12
provide
an
iterator
over
the
continual
connector_12
of
connector_data_2
be
produce
the
component_17
then
iterate
over
every
connector_data_3
in
the
connector_12
and
component_18
the
connector_data_4
of
the
connector_data_3
unlike
traditional
iterators
the
connector_data_3
connector_12
iterator
never
terminate
if
currently
no
connector_data_3
be
there
to
connector_14
the
iterator
block
until
connector_data_2
be
publish
to
the
topic
technology_2
support
both
the
point
to
point
delivery
component_7
in
which
multiple
component_10
jointly
connector_14
a
single
copy
of
connector_data_3
in
a
component_19
a
well
a
the
pattern_5
component_7
in
which
multiple
component_10
connector_18
it
own
copy
of
the
connector_data_3
follow
example
show
a
component_17

the
overall
architecture
of

show
in

since
technology_2

quality_attribute_1
in
nature
a

cluster
typically
consist
of
multiple
pattern_9

multiple
component_9

each
pattern_9
connector_19
one
or
more
of
those

multiple
component_20

every

a

unlike
traditional

a

doesn’t
have
explicit

coding_keyword_2
connector_data_2

technology_2

unlike
other
connector_data_3
component_1
technology_2

be
stateless
this
mean
that
the
component_17
have
to
maintain
how
much
it
have
connector_14
component_17
maintain
it
by
itself
and
pattern_9
would
not
do
anything
such
design
be
very
tricky
and
innovative
in
itself
it
be
very
tricky
to
delete
connector_data_3
from
the
pattern_9
a
pattern_9
doesn
t
whether
component_17
connector_14
the
connector_data_3
or
not
technology_2
innovatively
solve
this
problem
by
use
a
quality_attribute_13

retention
requirement_12
a
connector_data_3
be
automatically
delete
if
it
have
be
retain
in
the
pattern_9
long
than
a
certain
period
this
innovative
design
have
a
big
benefit
a
component_17
can
deliberately
rewind
back
to
an
old
offset
and
re
connector_14
connector_data_1
this
violate
the
common
contract
of
a
component_19
but
prove
to
be
an
essential
feature
for
many
component_17
technology_21
and
technology_2
consider
a
quality_attribute_1
component_1
with
multiple
component_6
each
of
which

some
potential
example
be
quality_attribute_1
search
component_22
quality_attribute_1
build
component_1
or

component_1
technology_1
technology_22
one
common
problem
with
all
these
quality_attribute_1
component_5
be
how
would
you
determine
which
component_16
be
alive
and
operate
at
any
give
point
of
time
most
importantly
how
would
you
do
these
thing
quality_attribute_15
in
the
face
of
the
difficulty
of
quality_attribute_1
computing
such
a
requirement_13
failure
bandwidth

variable
quality_attribute_10
connector_26
quality_attribute_3
concern
and
anything
else
that
can
go
wrong
in
a
requirement_13
environment
perhaps
even
across
multiple
connector_data_1

these
type
of

hey

there
be
a
couple
of
misconception
in

i
think
part
of
the
problem
be
that
this
be
largely
take
connector_data_13
from
a

paper
hence
the
old
version
of

some
of

an

connector_data_3
this

have
be
around

quite
some

but
wasn
t
there
in
the
early
version
of
the
describe
in
that
paper
that
this
seem
to
be
base
on
so
there
be
a
hard
guarantee
both
for
when
connector_data_1
have
be
connector_31
by
the
pattern_9
and
when
it
have
be
replicate

other
replica
these
guarantee
be
a
strong
a
any
i
have
see
for
any
pattern_1
component_1
alexis
and
cameron
imply
that
technology_2
be
somehow
more
special
purpose
than

component_1
it
would
probably
be
quality_attribute_9
to
expand
