consider

both

the

usually
the

either

it

a
not

be

this
be
all
fine
if
the

dead

the
connector_data_1
a
a
consequence
but
this
become
a
problem
if
the
pattern_4
simply
resends
the
connector_data_1
anyway
although
the
technology_1
sender
adapter
signal
to
the
pattern_4
that
it
cannot

do
not
wish
to

if

before

back
the

again
u
consider
the
two
worst
requirement_5
scenario
scenario

the
requirement_2
flow
be
unable
to

the
connector_data_1
successfully
without
component_13
connector_16

that
mean
when
re

the

component_2
will
continue

the

sender
adapter
be
configure
not

however
the

resends
the
connector_data_1
over

over
independent
of
the
configure
delivery
status
after
max

the
retry
attempt
will
not
be
visible
i
e
via

but
since
the
pattern_4
continue
to
connector_6
this
connector_data_1
the
component_12
have
to
pattern_11
it
out
and
this
connector_18
resource
mainly
cpu
and
even
bad
it
block
the
component_2
of
subsequent
connector_data_2
from
that
component_8
in
requirement_5
of
exclusive
component_7
or
connector_data_1
group
connector_19
these
infinite

would
make

while
put
the
health

fast
infinite
retry
attempt
can
flood
the

with

potentially
long
before
you
even
take
notice
of
this
hence
requirement_1
requirement_2
decide
to
sacrifice
quality_attribute_8
for
the

of
the

of

your

the

to
the
component_12
the
component_12
will
once
again
try
to
component_2
the
connector_data_1
with
up
to
n
subsequent
retry
before
connector_13
back
the
delivery
status
after
max
retry
–
again
since
the
pattern_4
resends
the
same
connector_data_1
indefinitely
this
connector_data_5
in
infinite
retry
attempt
and
since
the
requirement_2
flow
allow
retry
attempt
it
be
not
immediately
pattern_11
out
instead
it
be
actually
be
connector_5
and
you
will
see
an
mpl
for
this
in
retry
state
if
this
go
on
and
on
without
anybody
take
notice
and
act
on
this
situation
the
component_17
can
be
flood
and
the
tenant
become
unstable
way
out
of
the
misery
choose
a
pattern_4
that
support
dead
letter
and
make
sure
it
be
configure
to
do
so
base
on
the
delivery
status
after
max
retry
when
allow
retry
it
be
recommend
to
catch
and
handle
exception
in
an
exception
subprocess
if
you
re
raise
an
exception
i
e
error
end

the
component_2
will
fail
and
the
connector_data_1
will
be
retry
it
be
advisable
to
have
an
automate
way
of
handle
the
exception
successfully
i
e
end

to
avoid
infinite
retry
attempt
during
a
time
frame
the
tenant
be
not
actively
observe
retry
configuration
base
on
jmsredelivered
jmsxdeliverycount
there
be
no
option
to
configure
a
delay
in
retry
component_2
in
the
technology_1
adapter
because
this
be
not
support
by
the
technology_1
technology_3
one
option
to
delay
the
retry
in
error
requirement_5
be
to
configure
this
retry
handle
in
the
requirement_2
flow
use
dead
letter
component_7
in
the
pattern_1
component_4
if
this
be
support
by
the
pattern_1
component_4
this
can
be
configure
use
two

set
by
most
of
the
pattern_1
component_4
jmsredelivered
this
specify
if
the
connector_data_1
be
redelivered
requirement_4
‘false’
mean
that
this
connector_data_1
be
connector_20
for
the
first
time
requirement_4
‘true’
tell
you
that
this
connector_data_1
be
already
try
to
be

before
jmsxdeliverycount
this
specify
the

of

see
below
in
the
pattern_1
component_4
specific
section
for
more
detail
configure
delay
retry
component_2
the
first
step
to
configure
a
delay
retry
would
be
to
a
pattern_12
step
and
another
receiver
to
the
requirement_2
flow
connector_21
the
connector_data_1
in
the
pattern_12
the
connector_22
to
the
second
receiver
have
to
be
configure
in
such
a
way
that
connector_data_2
which
be
connector_4
for
the
second
time
be
connector_8
to
another
component_8
in
the
pattern_1
component_4
the
condition
in
the
pattern_12
can
be
define
by
use
one
of
the
above
mention
parameter
in
the
describe
sample
i
use
the
‘jmsxdeliverycount’
and
define
the
non
technology_14
expression
a
${header
jmsxdeliverycount}
‘1’
if
the
use
connector_data_1
pattern_4
do
not
support
this
you
can
use
the
‘jmsredelivered’
and
define
the
expression
a
${header
jmsredelivered}
=
‘true’
in
the
technology_1
receiver
pattern_7
a
different
component_8
be
configure
this
component_8
have
to
be
create
in
the
pattern_1
component_4
from
this
component_8
no
requirement_2
flow
connector_18
connector_data_1
it
be
only
use
a
storage
for
the
time
to
the
next
retry
in
my
sample
i
use
the
component_8
‘retryqueue’
in
the
parameter
for
this
component_8
it
need
to
be
specify
that
connector_data_2
be
move
to
a
dead
letter
component_8
after
a
specific
time
interval
time
to
live
this
configuration
have
to
be
make
in
the
pattern_1
component_4
by
use
the
technology_5
provide
by
the
pattern_1
component_4
note
if
the
use
connector_data_1
pattern_4
support
configure
any
component_8
a
dead
letter
component_8
you
can
directly
move
the
connector_data_1
back
to
the
original
component_2
component_8
and
do
not
need
to
do
this
via
explicit
component_2
from
this
dead
letter
component_8
we
can
then
connector_4
the
connector_data_1
and
put
it
back
to
the
original
component_2
component_8
this
be
do
in
a
separate
requirement_2
component_2
the
technology_1
sender
adapter
need
to
be
configure
to
connector_4
connector_data_2
from
the
dead
letter
component_8
of
the
retry
component_8
or
the
component_8
define
a
dead
letter
component_8
in
requirement_5
technology_15
component_18
bus
be
use
a
pattern_1
component_4
the
dead
letter
component_8
can
be
connector_23
by
use
the
follow
syntax
‘
component_8
$deadletterqueue’
this
be
different
for
other
pattern_1
component_4
make
sure
you
select
the
flag
‘consume
expire
messages’
this
be
require
because
the
connector_data_2
in
the
dead
letter
component_8
be
expire
because
the
expiration
time
be
use
a
the
delay
time
the
component_2
connector_24
the
connector_data_1
back
to
the
original
component_2
component_8
via
an
technology_1
receiver
adapter
so
that
it
can
be
connector_4
from
there
again
in
addition
to
these
configuration
you
need
to
make
sure
the
jmsxdeliverycount
or
jmsredelivered
be
connector_25
by
the
requirement_2
flow
for
this
we
configure
the
a
allow
in
the
runtime
configuration
of
the
requirement_2
flow
now
we
can
quality_attribute_5
the
requirement_2
flow
and
test
the
component_2
a
soon
a
a
connector_data_1
be
quality_attribute_1
in
the
component_2
component_8
in
the
pattern_1
component_4
the
connector_data_1
be
connector_4
by
requirement_1
requirement_2
if
there
be
an
error
during
component_2
the
component_2
fail
and
an
immediate
retry
be
connector_5
this
retry
connector_26
the
connector_data_1
in
the
separate
retry
component_8
where
the
connector_data_1
be
park
for
the
amount
of
time
configure
in
the
pattern_1
component_4
a
the
connector_data_1
be
not
connector_4
from
this
retry
component_8
it
be
move
to
the
dead
letter
component_8
after
the
configure
time
to
live
a
soon
a
it
be
quality_attribute_1
in
the
dead

component_8
the
second
component_2
connector_18
the
connector_data_1
and
connector_26
it
to
the
original
component_2
component_8
from
there
it
be
connector_4
and
try
to
be
component_2
again
the
same
retry
would
be
connector_27
if
again
an
error
in
component_2
occur
you
see
with
this
we
be
able
to
define
a
kind
of
retry
interval
the
connector_data_1
would
only
be
retry
after
a
define
time
interval
what
be
not
possible
with
this
configuration
be
to
stop
a
connector_data_1
after
a
certain
number
of
retry
how
this
can
be
do
we
see
in
the
next
section
stop
retry
component_2
after
x
retry
first
we
need
to
introduce
a
counter
that
count
the
number
of
connector_5
retry
for
this
we
cannot
use
the
jmsxdeliverycount
set
by
the
pattern_1
component_4
because
we
move
the
connector_data_2
between
different
component_7
and
so
the
jmsxdeliverycount
be
always
reset
we
define
our
own
counter
in
the
component_2
that
connector_24
the
connector_data_1
back
to
the
component_2
component_8
we
do
this
in
a
small
technology_7
script
in
the
script
we
set
a
retrycount
note
that

with
prefix
technology_16
be
not
allow
such

be
not

furthermore
we
extend
the

in

that
connector_18
connector_data_2
from
the
component_2
component_8
by

an
additional
pattern_12
step
in
this
pattern_12
step
we
evaluate
the
retrycount

and
if
it
be
great
or
equal

we
do
some
alternative
handle
and
stop
the

in
my
sample
i
simply
connector_2
the
connector_data_1
to
a
connector_data_7
component_6
but
any
other

could
be
do
a

a
a
last
step
we
need
to
the

in
the
allow

in

of

now
we
can
quality_attribute_5
the

in

the

you

the

configure

in

a

in

there
be
two
way
to

i
though
this

be
outdated

quality_attribute_11
or
should
i

sad

now
switch

thus
the

the

still

me
because
i
simply
to

happen
they

at

i
must
say
that
technology_2

right
now
no

no

by
the

–
use

be
no

right
now
because
we
use

perhaps
you

find

the

way
perhaps
other

have
similar

the

isn

the

it

this
can
happen
over

over

multiple

the

this

the

that
when

you

the

connector_data_18
of

eventually

you

you
not

this

if

this

in

you

it

to

the
