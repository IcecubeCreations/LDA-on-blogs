this
reason
multiple

let’s
discus
one
use
requirement_5
in
more
detail
use
a
real

example
real

fraud
detection
this
fraud
detection
use
requirement_5
be
from
one
of
my
employer’s
component_20
in
the
finance
sector
but
it
be
relevant
for
most
vertical
the
actual
fraud
requirement_8
and
connector_data_1
component_12
differ
among
different
fraud
scenario
the
requirement_20
need
to
pattern_5
component_19
drive
algorithm
and
look
for
suspicious
pattern_2
in
this
requirement_5
the
pattern_2
of
interest
require
correlation
of
five
connector_14
of
real
time
connector_data_1
pattern_2
happen
within
second
window
during
which
thousand
of
dollar
could
be
lose
attack
come
in
burst
previously
the
connector_data_1
require
to
find
these
pattern_2
be
load
into
a
dwh
and
report
be
connector_21
each
day
decision
to
act
be
make
every
day
but
regulation
in
the
capital
requirement_15
require
firm
to
understand
requirement_13
pattern_2
in
real
time
so
the
previous
dwh
base
architecture
be
now
“too
late”
to
comply
with
requirement_13
regulation
the
connector_1
component_1
implementation
now
intercept
the
connector_data_1
before
it
hit
the
dwh
by
connector_22
streambase
directly
to
the
component_15
of
requirement_13
mark
palmer
take
up
the
story
in
more
detail
once
this
firm
could
see
pattern_2
of
fraud
they
be
face
with
a
challenge
what
to
do
about
it
how
many
time
do
the
pattern_2
need
to
be
repeat
until
active
surveillance
be
start
should
the
action
be
quarantine
for
a
period
or
halt
immediately
all
these
question
be
and
the
answer
to
them
keep
connector_12
the
fact
that
the
answer
keep
connector_12
highlight
the
importance
of
ease
of
use
requirement_8
must
be
connector_12
quickly
and
be
make

expert
in

requirement_5
in

a
understand

and
a
the
bad
guy
connector_12
their
pattern_10
the
end
of
the
will
describe
some
more
real

use
requirement_5
which
combine
connector_1
component_1
with
a
dwh
and

by
do
it
yourself
use
a

or
a

do
it

should
not
be
an
option
in
most
requirement_5
because
there
be
quality_attribute_13
open_source
technology_23
quality_attribute_11
for
free
however
a
connector_1
component_1
technology_14
might
solve
many
of
your
issue
out
of
the
component_21
while
a
technology_23
still
require
a

you

in
addition
you
have
to
evaluate
cost
of

reduce

connector_data_1
mart
etc
in

storm
it
be
sometimes
use
in

connector_1
component_1
component_11
so
connector_1
component_1
technology_14
can
be
complementary
to

storm
if

will
be
a
lot
of

time
and
high

have
discus
different
technology_23
and
technology_14
alternative
let’s
take
a
look
at
how
connector_1
component_1
fit
into
a
requirement_1
architecture
why
and
how
to
combine
connector_1
component_1
with
a
dwh
or
technology_1
be
describe
in
the
next
section
relation
of
connector_1
component_1
to
connector_data_1
requirement_2
and
technology_1
a
requirement_1
architecture
contain
connector_1
component_1
for
real
time
requirement_8
and
technology_1
for
connector_30
all
kind
of
connector_data_1
and
long
run
computation
a
third
part
be
the
connector_data_1
requirement_2
dwh
which
connector_13
pattern_6
connector_data_1
for
report
and
requirement_17
see
“hadoop
and
dwh
–
friend
enemy
or
profiteer
what
about
real
time
”
for
more
detail
about
combine
these
three
part
within
a
requirement_1
architecture
in
summary
requirement_1
be
not
technology_1
concentrate
on
requirement_12
requirement_11
so
the
question
be
not
an
“either
or”
decision
dwh
technology_1
and
connector_1
component_1
complement
each
other
very
well
therefore
the
requirement_16
pattern_12
be
even
more
important
in
the
requirement_1
era
because
you
have
to
combine
more
and
more
different
connector_31
and
component_15
connector_1
component_1
and
dwh
a
dwh
be
a
great
technology_22
to
component_10
and
analyze
pattern_6
connector_data_1
you
can
component_10
terabyte
of
connector_data_1
and
connector_2
answer
to
your
connector_15
about
historical
connector_data_1
within
second
dwh
technology_14
such
a
technology_43
or
hp
vertica
be
build
for
this
use
requirement_5
however
the
technology_44
component_23
often
take
too
long
requirement_12
want
to
query
up
to
date
connector_data_2
instead
of
use
an
approach
where
you
only
connector_2
connector_data_2
about
what
happen
yesterday
this
be
where
connector_1
component_1
come
in
and
fee
all
connector_data_1
into
the
dwh
immediately
some
vendor
already
offer
this
combination
for
example
amazon’s
requirement_10
offer
include
kinesis
for
real

connector_1
component_1
and
connector
to
it
dwh

technology_39
a

tick
component_10
then
complex
component_1
and
the
dwh
be
use

component_12
to

actual
requirement_13
component_4
use
streambase’s
connector
another
set
of
use
requirement_5
be
around
use
connector_1
component_1
a
a
“live
connector_data_1
mart”
use
that
to
front
end
both
connector_5
connector_data_1
and
a
historical
component_10
in
a
dwh
through
a
unify
technology_23
technology_36
liveview
be
an
example
for
build
such
a
“live

easily
besides
act

the
“live

offer
pattern_9
and
in

to
human
also
describe
some
interest
use
requirement_5
for

modernization
use

offload
move

connector_32
connector_data_1
from

use

connector_data_1
from

and
free
up
the
dwh
for
more
pattern_6
deep
requirement_8
connector_1
component_1
and
technology_1
a
combination
of
connector_1
component_1
and
technology_1
be
key
for
it
and
requirement_12
technology_1
be
never
build
for
real

component_1
technology_1
initially
start
with
mapreduce
which
offer
pattern_13
component_1
where
connector_15
take
hour
minute
or
at
best
second
this
be
and
will
be
great
for
complex
transformation
and
computation
of
requirement_1
volume
however
it
be
not
so
quality_attribute_13
for
hoc
connector_data_1
exploration
and
real
time
requirement_8
multiple
vendor
have
though
make
improvement
and
capability
to
technology_1
that
make
it
capable
of
be
more
than
a
pattern_13
technology_23
for
example
technology_45
stinger

from
hortonworks
to
improve

accelerate
technology_15
connector_15
with

query
component_28
e

which
do
not
use

e

technology_43
emc
greenplum
combine
technology_1

query
component_28
again
without

in
either
pattern_13

so
both
concept
can
be
combine
within
a

technology_23
for
more
detail
see
this
news
technology_29
and
technology_33
be
not
invent
to
run
on

but
now
they
be
quality_attribute_15
and
support
by
the
most
popular
technology_1
distribution
technology_34
hortonworks
technology_35
and
can
be
use
for
connector_26
connector_1
component_1
on
top
of
technology_1
the
lack
of
maturity
and
quality_attribute_13
technology_22
be
obstacle
you
usually
have
to
live
with
with
early
open_source
technology_22
and
requirement_16
but
you
can
connector_2
a
lot
do
and
these
be
great
technology_22
some
connector_1
component_1
technology_14
develop
connector
use
technology_16
technology_47
in
the
requirement_5
of
streambase
to
technology_1
storm
etc
and
might
therefore
be
a
quality_attribute_13
alternative
to
a
technology_23
for
combine
connector_1
component_1
and
technology_1
let’s
take
a
look
at
a
real

requirement_15
txodds
selected
technology_36

zero
quality_attribute_6
requirement_8
in
combination
with
technology_1
the
requirement_12
scenario
be
that

take
place
after
the
actual

have
start
and
that
txodds
need

movement
intelligent

and
in

use
technology_44
and
pattern_13
component_1
to
compute

this
requirement
be
come
more

more
into
every
vertical
many
different
technology_23
and
technology_14
be
quality_attribute_11
on
the
requirement_15
already
however
the
number
of
mature
solution
with
quality_attribute_13
technology_22
and
commercial

be
small
today
technology_16
technology_29
be
a

open_source
technology_23
however
custom
cod
be
require
due
to
a
lack
of

technology_22
and
there’s
no
commercial
