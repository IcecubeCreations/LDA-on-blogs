when
an

this
explore
the

grasp
of
the

here

up
and
use
requirement_2
down
—
focus
on
requirement_4
feedin
the
2nd
part
we
develop
use
requirement_2
which
first
lead
to
bind
component_6
and
then
to
component_1
u
take
some
more
advantage
of
the
use

for
the
illustration
of

we

firstly
assume
that
we
be
deal
with
purely
pattern_1
connector_1

will
be

this
can
be
categorize

have
to

with

order
to
transport
this
connector_data_1
to

synchronously
the
requirement_4
fee
component_9
would
need
to
to
each
of
those
apis
this
be
the
first
smell
of
this
approach
—
the
requirement_4
fee
component_1
would
need
to
about
the
other
component_10
and
make
direct
connector_data_5
to
them
this
would
make
it
dependent
on
other
component_1
in
other
word
we
would
be
introduce

“if
connector_9

the
connector_data_1
would
not
reach
the
follow
component_1
until
the
previous
one
have
component_7
the
connector_data_3
and
respond
in
high
frequency
traffic
such
a
requirement_5
connector_10
on
various
instrument
quality_attribute_1
should
be
drive
a
low
a
possible
we
could
prioritize
the
order
of
the
connector_data_2
most
likely
opt
to
start
with
the
account
requirement_6
component_1
for
it
mission
critical
but
a
quality_attribute_2
approach
here
would
be
to
use
pattern_9
when
make
the
connector_data_3
technology_2
connector_data_4
can
be
handle
synchronously
component_12
be
block
or
asynchronously
component_12
be
not
block
and
the
connector_6
will
reach
a
pattern_9
eventually
regardless
of
the
component_13
connector_11
however
the
connector_1
still
u
a
pattern_1
technology_4
mean
each
connector_data_3
require
a
connector_6
connector_8
&
quality_attribute_4
quote
connector_12
with
pattern_9
this
way
instead
of
wait
for
the
connector_6
before
connector_13
a
connector_data_3
we
could
register
pattern_2
connector_data_6
the
connector_data_4
all
at
once
and
then
wait
for
the
connector_6
this
approach
would
make
the
component_2
more
quality_attribute_5
a
mention
early
before
we
could
connector_5
a
connector_6
from
the
technology_2
connector_data_2
the
connector_7
component_1
would
need
to
component_7
the
connector_data_3
this
could
mean
directly
handle
the
quote
connector_9
and
make
the
necessary
calculation
base
on
it
to
make
it
more
quality_attribute_3
the
connector_7
party
could
publish
the
quote
connector_9
internally
and
another
component_12
handle
the
heavy
calculation
whichever
way
we
would
component_7
the
connector_data_1
however
the
initial
requester
would
still
be
hold
up
while
all
the
correspond
component_4
be
finish
with
the
handle
and
connector_5
back
with
a
connector_6
in
our
example
the
requirement_4
fee
component_1
would
have
to
wait
for
distinct
technology_2
connector_data_5
plus
the
component_7
in
between
before
it
could
move
on
to
the
next
quote
think
about
the
application’s
component_6
—
a
single
technology_5
instrument
during
active
requirement_3
hour
produce
well
over
several
requirement_5
connector_10
per
second
on
average
a
terminal
should
be
able
to
seamlessly
subscribe
to
a
whole
index
worth
of
symbol
simultaneously
which
could
mean
component_7
hundred
if
not
thousand
of
individual
quote
per
second
with
the
high
amount
of
requirement_1
connector_data_5
and
the
connector_14
on
other
component_4
while
quality_attribute_4
the
quote
the
requirement_4
fee
component_1
would
quickly
turn
into
a
bottleneck
in
our
component_2
since
connector_7
requirement_5
connector_10
be
also
the
logical
entry
point
to
our
system’s
workflow
we
would
be
set
significant
limit
to
our
capacity
in
short
the
pattern_1
pattern_5
have
introduce
u
to
the
follow
potential
issue
so
far
through
connector_7
&
quality_attribute_4
quote
the
connector_data_4
would
potentially
be
hold
up
for
a
long
time
due
to
be
dependent
on
other
component_1
this
would
quickly
turn
one
of
the
core
feature
of
our
component_2
into
a
bottleneck
accounting
the
quality_attribute_1
and
numerous
connector_data_3
handle
our
component_4
would
be
tightly
couple
lose
one
of
the
key
benefit
of
ddd
and
the
pattern_3
architecture
component_1
dependent
on
the
connector_1
would
connector_8
connector_data_4
with
a
slight
offset
mean
we
would
have
to
prioritize
connector_data_1
distribution
requirement_3

and
use

down

on
to

the

the

component_1
this
use
requirement_2
will
not
be
under
a
frequent
connector_data_3
load
a
the
other
component_4
in
this
solution
due
to
not
directly
handle
quote
regardless
of
be
idle
for
most
of
the
time
it
need
to
be
one
of
the
more

with

can
be

so
far
during

i
have
assume
that
the

with
the

will
be

a

for

sake
u
assume

the

start
with

in
this
example

will
need

first
u
skip
the
quality_attribute_6
pattern_4
for
now
after

validation
the
executor
need
to
ensure
that
the
order
comply
with
the
risk
requirement_6
rule
for
that
the
account
requirement_6
component_1
would
be
via

once
the
correspond
calculation
be
do
and
the
connector_6
be
connector_16
back
to
the
executor
assume
all
validation
have
pass
so
far
the
next
connector_data_3
would
involve
the
pattern_8
technology_3
before
the
component_14
component_1
could
finish
the
connector_data_3
lifecycle
the
executor
would
also
need
to
direct
the
order
connector_data_3
to
the
pattern_8
additional
component_7
a
requirement_3
would
need
to
be
connector_12
and
the
follow
connector_6
should
be
to
the
executor
component_1
in
other
word
it
would
mean
quality_attribute_7
on
a
series
of
sequential
technology_2
connector_data_5
to
complete
across
three
component_1
in
short
in
addition
to
tight
couple
this
sort
of
solution
would
inevitably
lead
to
low
requirement_7
due
to
block
even
if
the
individual
component_4
would
not
fail
from
time
to
time
which
they
will
chain
them
through
technology_2
connector_data_5
would
impact
the
requirement_7
and
quality_attribute_8
of
the
entire
component_2
when
any
one
of
the
component_4
in
the
chain
fail
the
whole
chain
will
if
not
handle
correctly
a
pattern_3
component_2
should
be
able
to
withstand
partial
failure
which
in
this
requirement_2
would
be
achieve
through
retry
component_15
and
circuit
breaker
however
due
to
the
tangle
nature
of
the
technology_2
chain
the
failure
component_15
would
quickly
connector_5
relatively
complex
to
handle
the
final
smell
in
this
example
be
that
the
executor
component_1
would
resemble
a
central
orchestrator
by
involve
numerous
other
component_4
in
it
work
while
this
approach
be
use
in
pattern_10
from
which
the
pattern_3
derive
it
be
consider
an
anti
pattern_5
in
pattern_3
architecture
to
summarize
handle
connector_1
synchronously
would
lead
to
high
couple
a
the
component_4
would
need
to
be
aware
of
each
other
to
make
the
necessary

moreover

where
the
initial

while
all
of
the

be
inefficient
and
prone
to

what
be
more

in
such
a
manner
closely
resemble
a

where
instead
of

we
would

of

pattern_11
furthermore
component_4

connector_14

chain
be
relatively
painful
connector_11
wise
it
would
obviously
prolong
the
connector_data_4
even
more
development
wise
due
to
the
high
couple
it
would
require
significant
enhancement
of
both

in
the
connector_18

of
mainly

the
shortcoming
of

this
be
why

suit
the

best
and
be
the
recommend

to

of
note
here
the
actual

between
the

and
the

component_8
be
pattern_1
in
this
example
it
be
a
single
technology_2
connector_data_3
that
do
not
block
any
other
component_1
since
the
pattern_8
component_8
be
not
part
of
our
internal
component_2
we
could
not
subscribe
it
to
our
connector_data_7

even
if
we
want
to
we
can
make
the
connector_1
completely
pattern_13
with

i
intend
to
achieve
for
these

however
a
pattern_7

on
the
pattern_8
side
be
perhaps
more
unifiedly

we
have
not
yet
discus
the
specific
of
fix
connector_1
which
we
will
in
the
upcoming
a
with
most
any
solution
there
be
two
side
to
the
coin
use
a
middleman
to
handle
the
connector_data_8
have
increase
the
number
of
time
the
connector_data_1
be
exchange
over
the
requirement_1
additionally
this
sort
of
back
and
forth
indirect
pattern_16
through
a
mediator
another
pattern_4
and
with
it
more
complexity
to
our
component_2
i
be
also
aware
that
the
connector_1
pattern_5
could
be
make
significantly
more
direct
and
le
chatty
if
we
be
to
merge
the
executor
and
the
account
requirement_6
component_1
whilst
the
bind
component_6
determine
in
part
make
a
relatively
clean
cut
between
the
component_1
boundary
and
nicely
segregate
the
responsibility
this
potential
refactoring
be
worth
explore
further
with
the
current
architecture
the
executor
do
not
need
to
handle
quote
it
need
to
be
technology_9
and
independent
of
the
heavy
load
that
the
component_7
of
quote
might
produce
if
we
be
to
merge
it
with
the
account
requirement_6
component_1
it
might
not
be
a
responsive
at
all
time
however
the
executor
component_1
be
highly
dependent
on
the
account
requirement_6
component_1
an
important
requirement_8
rule
in
a
requirement_3
component_3
be
that
no
connector_11
should
be
make
before
it
effect
on
the
overall
portfolio
be
ass
so
basically
the
only
one
pattern_17
to
directly
connector_data_3
order
connector_11
be
the
account
requirement_6
component_1
this
sort
of
tight
couple
hint
that
we
should
consider
merge
the
two
component_1
requirement_3
terminal
container
diagram
refactored
i
have
merge
the
executor
component_1
with
account
requirement_6
and
the
connector_data_7
pattern_8
compare
to
the
requirement_3
terminal
component_5
we
start
out
with
this
solution
pattern_2
connector_1
via
a
connector_data_7
pattern_8
and
merge
executor
and
account
requirement_6
component_1
have
produce
the
follow
advantage
the
requirement_3
terminal
solution
be
loosely
couple
component_1
only
need
to
be
aware
of
their
own
respective
responsibility
and
respond
to
certain
great
pattern_18
strongly
relate
connector_11
and
account
requirement_6

be
component_5
close
together
core

quality_attribute_4

between

handle

asynchronously
refactored
before
dive
deep
into
the
mechanic
of
the
connector_data_7
pattern_8
component_5
the
specific
component_19
and
we
should
figure
out
one
more
important
aspect
—
connector_data_9
requirement_6
this
will
be
the
final
piece
to
the
puzzle
on
a
high
level
a
it
require
u
to
determine
where
and
how
do
we
keep
the
connector_data_9
within
the
component_2
pattern_2
connector_1
enable
u
to
use
pattern_5
such
a
eventual
consistency
or
component_24
note
pattern_2
connector_1
do
not
only
include
connector_data_7
pattern_8
and
webhooks
websockets
and
pattern_19
be
also
part
of
this
category
to
name
a
few
to
keep
the
focus
on
the
matter
at
hand
however
these
example
be
not
explore
at
this
time
summarymanaging
a
pattern_3
solution
synchronously
would
be
direct
and
easy
to
comprehend
but
would
quickly
tangle
and
couple
the
component_4
with
chain
technology_2
connector_data_2
and
make
the
component_2
resemble
a
quality_attribute_4
monolith
pattern_2
pattern_5
with
pattern_14
connector_1
eliminate
these
issue
and
make
the
solution
more
quality_attribute_11
this
do
not
come
without
cost
however
a
a
connector_data_7
mediator
bring
on
an
additional
pattern_4
to
the
connector_1
and
with
it
more
complexity
analyze
inter
component_1
connector_1
reveal
where
the
exchange
of
connector_data_1
might
connector_5
too
chatty
signal
the
need
for
great
pattern_18
the
component_5
be
bind
to
connector_9
or
rather
quality_attribute_12
in
light
of
connector_data_1
refactoring
should
not
be
avoid
rather
welcome
whenever
it
lead
to
a
deep
component_5
our
blueprint
have
solve
yet
another
piece
of
the
puzzle
there
be
load
of
interest
topic
to
cover
such
a
autonomy
resiliency
and
connector_data_9
consistency
in
the
next
part
we
will
figure
out
how
connector_data_9
will
be
manage
within
the
requirement_3
terminal
after
which
we
should
have
quite
a
clear
overview
of
how
the
requirement_3
terminal
be
go
to
this
enable
u
to
move
deep
into
