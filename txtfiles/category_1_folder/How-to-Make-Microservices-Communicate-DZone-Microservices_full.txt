i’m
sure
you
want
to
build
quality_attribute_3
component_2
right
who
doesn’t
if
so
you
must
have
come
across
the
word
“cloud
requirement_7
”
this
approach
be
an
angel
which
can
resolve
most
of
your
quality_attribute_4
challenge
so
what
exactly
be
requirement_4
requirement_7
requirement_4
requirement_7
be
an
approach
use
to
build
component_2
which
can
harness
all
the
capability
of
the
requirement_4
yup
you
connector_4
that
right
it’s
an
approach
not
a
technology_2
not
a
bunch
of
step
to
follow
and
due
to
this
there
be
a
million
different
approach
to
go
requirement_4
requirement_7
and
achieve
requirement_4
computing
“moksha
”
one
key
principle
of
requirement_4
requirement_7
be
pattern_1
pattern_1
be
tiny
sometimes
not
so
tiny
which
can
work
independently
of
each
other
they
could
have
connector_5
on
other
pattern_1
or
even
a
connector_data_1
persistence
pattern_3
a
component_1
but
the
key
be
to
use
loose
couple
pattern_1
coordinate
by
mean
of
“communication
”
this
mean
each
pattern_4
sit
in
a
different
pattern_5
and
be
be
quality_attribute_5
independently
for
the
devops
folk
out
there
you
have
an
independent
continuous
delivery
pipeline
dedicate
to
each
pattern_4
but
that
bring
me
to
the
most
important
question
how
can
we
make
pattern_1
talk
keep
aside
the
difficulty
in
decide
on
a
“forward
compatible”
component_3
for
pattern_1
make
them
talk
isn’t
a
quality_attribute_6
a
it
look
there
be
multiple
parameter
you
need
to
consider
these
be
quality_attribute_7
quality_attribute_8
and
quality_attribute_9
now
there
be
many
way
to
classify
the
different
mode
of
connector_6
pattern_6
block
and
pattern_7
non
block
be
use
quite
often
but
i
feel
these
be
mostly
the
characteristic
of
a
programing
technology_3
i’m
also
go
to
disregard
half
vs
full
duplex
mode
since
these
day
it’s
very
easy
to
use
either
or
even
both
in
most
requirement_4
architecture
so
let’s
dive
in
the
brokerless
design
what
it
be
in
here
we
make
our
pattern_1
talk
to
each
other
directly
you
could
use
technology_4
for
traditional
connector_data_2
connector_7
or
use
websockets
or
http2
for
connector_8
there
be
no
pattern_8
technology_5
except
pattern_9
and
load
balancer
between
two
or
more
pattern_1
you
can
connector_9
to
any
component_4
directly
provide
you
their
component_4
connector_10
and
the
component_3
use
by
them
sound
pretty
basic
right
it
pretty
much
be
there
be
wonderful
technology_6
grpc
to
make
life
much
easy
the
pro
low
quality_attribute_8
this
have
the
low
quality_attribute_8
possible
there
be
no
middle
man
here
it’s
fast
the
limitation
be
impose
mostly
due
to
poor
component_3
implementation
but
again
technology_7
grpc
make
sure
you
connector_4
maximum
requirement_6
at
the
component_3
pattern_3
easy
to
connector_11
a
brokerless
design
be
easy
to
visualise
and
connector_11
this
make
life
much
easy
and
the
world
a
happy
place
to
live
in
easy
debug
this
be
fairly
easy
to
debug
especially
from
the
next
one
i’m
go
to
talk
about
debug
or
trace
where
the
error
be
be
a
super
important
topic
in
quality_attribute_10
component_5
this
become
even
more
important
when
you
be
release
connector_data_3
multiple
time
a
day
high
quality_attribute_7
in
this
mechanism
more
cpu
cycle
be
actually
spend
on
do
work
rather
than
connector_12
it
not
be
that
apparent
now
but
a
pattern_10
design
would
make
this
a
bit
more
clear
it’s
not
a
surprise
that
most
of
the
component_1
component_6
actually
use
a
brokerless
design
the
con
component_4
discovery
in
such
a
design
component_4
discovery
have
utmost
importance
the
component_4
discovery
mechanism
need
to
be
responsive
and
quality_attribute_3
enough
to
reflect
the
late
state
of
the
cluster
connector_13
nightmare
imagine
if
all
the
pattern_1
need
to
connector_9
to
each
other
that
would
be
a
lot
of
connector_13
most
of
these
connector_13
be
fairly
idle
a
a
connector_data_4
a
lot
of
resource
be
waste
due
to
this
tightly
couple
by
nature
brokerless
design
be
tightly
couple
imagine
you
have
a
pattern_4
to
component_7
online
payment
now
you
want
another
pattern_4
to
give
you
a
real
time
update
of
number
of
payment
happen
per
minute
this
will
require
you
to
make
modification
in
multiple
pattern_1
which
be
undesirable
in
many
requirement_8
a
brokerless
design
doesn’t
work
you
often
have
requirement
to
simply
publish
the
connector_data_5
once
and
have
multiple
pattern_11
connector_14
it
this
be
where
a
pattern_10
design
come
into
the
picture
the
pattern_12
bus
pattern_10
design
what
it
be
in
this
architecture
all
connector_6
be
connector_12
via
a
group
of
pattern_10
pattern_10
be
component_8
component_9
run
some
advance
connector_15
algorithm
each
pattern_4
connector_16
to
a
pattern_10
the
pattern_4
can
connector_17
and
connector_18
connector_data_6
via
the
same
connector_13
the
component_4
connector_19
connector_data_6
be
connector_20
a
pattern_13
and
receiver
be
connector_20
a
pattern_11
connector_data_6
be
publish
to
a
particular
“topic
”
a
pattern_11
connector_21
those
connector_data_6
for
topic
to
which
it
have
subscribe
the
pro
load
balance
most
pattern_12
pattern_10
support
load
balance
out
of
the
component_10
this
make
the
overall
architecture
much
quality_attribute_6
and
highly
quality_attribute_3
some
pattern_10

technology_8
have
build
in
retry
and
more
for
make
the
connector_6
pattern_14
more
quality_attribute_11
component_4
discovery
component_4
discovery
be
not
require
when
use
a
pattern_12
backend
all
pattern_1
act
a
component_11
the
only
component_4
which
need
to
be
discoverable
be
the
connector_data_5
pattern_10
fan
in
and
fan
out
a
pattern_12
backend
make
it
easy
to
quality_attribute_10
workload
and
aggregate
the
connector_data_4
the
best
part
be
that

component_12
pattern_1
can
be
do
transparently
without
have
to
update
the
other
pattern_1
connector_8
base
design
such
an
approach
also
give
birth
to
a
concept
of
connector_8
each
topic
be
essentially
a
connector_8
of
connector_data_5
any
pattern_11
can
tap
into
these
connector_22
a
and
when
require
the
possibility
of
component_13
a
component_5
design
use
connector_22
be
endless
the
con
quality_attribute_4
the
pattern_10
while
the
advantage
be
amaze
quality_attribute_4
the
pattern_10
themselves
become
a
challenge
for
highly
quality_attribute_10
component_5
it’s
another
piece
to
maintain
alongside
your
pattern_1
high
quality_attribute_8
the
number
of
hop
in
a
connector_data_5
bus
increase
the
overall
quality_attribute_8
this
be
especially
true
for
a
pattern_15

use
requirement_8
in
mission
critical
component_2
this
might
not
be
a
feasible
solution
high
resource
utilization
the
pattern_10
need
cpu
memory
and
storage
resource
to
run
these
resource
could
otherwise
be
utilize
for
run
other
pattern_1
the
overhead
associate
with
a
pattern_10
design
could
be
too
much
for
a
small
cluster

the
advantage
and
disadvantage
of
various
architecture
isn’t
enough
it
be
important
to
when
to
use
what
you
must
always
default
to
a
brokerless
design
make
the
switch
if
you
need
the
quality_attribute_12
of
connector_22
or
need
to
leverage
the
pattern_16
semantics
of
a
connector_data_5
bus
if
you’re
start
off
fresh
it
would
make
sense
to
start
with
a
brokerless
design
and
then
switch
once
the
need
rise
it’s
not
necessary
to
choose
one
you
can
use
both
for
our
technology_7
we
be
use
a
pattern_10
design
to
connector_11
the
pattern_15
connector_data_7
the
connector_6
with
our
component_1
pattern_3
be
brokerless
to
provide
lower
quality_attribute_8
if
you
be
opt
for
a
pattern_1
base
architecture
i
always
recommend
go
drive
drive
architecture
can
be
see
a
have
an
advance
pattern_10
at
it
core
which
have
a
a
ton
of
capability

connector_data_8
schedule
build
in
wrap
up
use
the
right
approach
for
the
be
important
choose
the
mode
of
connector_6
be
a
fundamental
decision
which
need
to
be
take
with
great
care
there
be
multiple
option
for
both
stick
to
a
well
establish
technology_2
almost
always
make
more
sense
than
make
something
from
scratch
there
be
so
many
option
out
there
for
connector_data_5
pattern_10
you’ve
connector_4
technology_8
nats
technology_9
etc
and
each
one
be
build
for
particular
pattern_12
semantics
another
awesome
way
be
to
use
a
backend
a
a
component_4
space
requirement_4
space
requirement_4
will
automate
the
entire
backend
so
you
can
focus
on
the
requirement_9
component_14
rather
than
the
the
requirement_4
architecture
do
this
help
you

do
you
make
