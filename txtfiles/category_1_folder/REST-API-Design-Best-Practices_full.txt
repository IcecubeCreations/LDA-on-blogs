hey
guy
in

we
will
discus
a

best

for

s
design
this
belong
to
my
favorite
technology_1
best

series
category
before
design
and
develop
rest
technology_41
i
suggest
you
connector_3
this
to
develop
a
quality_attribute_4
restful
technology_41
what
be

the
pattern_1
stand
for
representational

understand
the

be
a

to
design

use
noun
for

identificationthe
fundamental
concept
of
a
rest
base
component_10
be
the
resource
a

anything
you
want

to
use

for
an
easy
understand
use

connector_data_5
for

bad
practice
do
not
use
verb

getallusers
getuserbyid
createnewuser
updateuser
deleteuser

use
plural
noun
to
name
a
resourcewhen
you
have
to
develop
the
resource
in
pattern_1
technology_41
go
with
plural
noun

t
mix
up
singular
and
plural
use
plural
noun
to
name
a
resource
for
example
use
student
instead

studentuse
requirement_2
instead
of
employeeuse
order
instead
of
orderuse
component_3
instead
of
useruse
requirement_4
instead
of
customer3
use
proper
technology_47

for
serialization
technology_42
both
component_12
and
component_13
need
to
which
technology_42
be
use
for
the
connector_9
the
technology_42
have
to
be
specify
in
the
technology_47

content
type
define
the
connector_data_8
technology_42
connector_10
define
a
connector_data_6
of
acceptable
connector_11
technology_42
on
the
component_13
side
an
incoming
connector_data_8
have
an
component_14
attach
to
it
to
determine
it
type
the
component_13
us
the
technology_47
connector_data_8
content
type
some
common
example
of
content
type
be
“text

“application

“text

“application

“image

and
“image

jsonsimilarly
to
determine
what
type
of
representation
be
desire
on
the
component_12
side
an
technology_47
connector_10
be
use
it
will
have
one
of
the
requirement_5
mention
for
content
type
above
connector_10
component_4
json4
connector_5
and
query
parameter
should
not
alter
the
state
use
put

and
delete
instead
of
the
connector_5
to
alter
the
state
do
not
use
connector_5
for

connector_12
connector_5

activate

use
sub

for

if
a

can
only
exist
within
another
resource
pattern_4
principle
provide
useful
guidance
in
rest
the
relationship
be
often
component_15
by
a

use
the
follow
