be
the

i
spend
a

deal
of

technology_3
especially
after
connector_4
quality_attribute_3
technology_2
3rd

where
joshua
bloch
advise
how
to
use
exist
component_2
for
development
rather
than
connector_5
piece
of
for
common
stuff
that
advise
make
sense
to
me
because
of
the
test
exposure
2nd
party
technology_1
connector_3
in
this
i
be
go
to
connector_6
some
of
the
most
useful
and
essential
technology_1
and
component_2
that
a
technology_2
developer
should
be
familiar
with
however
i
be
not
include
technology_4
e
g
technology_5
and
technology_6
because
they
be
pretty
well
and
have
specific
feature
in
general
i
be

include

technology_9
and
unit
test
component_2
junit
and
mockito
if
you
need
to
use
them
in
your

then
you
can
either
include
jar
of
these
technology_1
in
your

s
classpath
to
start
use
them
or
you
can
use
technology_10
for
connector_7
requirement_8
when
you
use
technology_10
for
connector_7
requirement_8
it
will
automatically
download
these

include
the

they
quality_attribute_4
on
a
the
transitive
connector_7
for
example
if
you
download
the

technology_4
it
will
also
download
all
other
jar
on
which
technology_5
be

for
example
technology_7
you
might
not
realize
but
have
the
right

of

be
a

headache
if

useful
open_source
technology_1
for
technology_2
programmer
here
be
my
collection
of
some
of
the
useful
third
party
technology_1
technology_2
developer
can
use
in
their
component_3
to
do
a
lot
of
useful
connector_data_1
in
order
to
use
these
technology_1
technology_2
developer
should
be
familiar
with
that
and
this
be
the
whole
point
of
this
if
you
have
an
idea
then
you
can
research
about
that
technology_1
and
use
it
requirement_1
technology_1
requirement_1
technology_1
be
very
common
because
you
need
them
in
every
project
they
be
the
most
important
thing
for
component_4
side
component_3
because
requirement_1
be
only
place
where
you
can
see
what
s
go
on
your
component_3
even
though
jdk
ship
with
it
own
requirement_1
technology_1
there
be
quality_attribute_2
alternative
quality_attribute_5
e
g
technology_7
slf4j
and
technology_11
a
technology_2
developer
should
be
familiar
with
the
pro
and
con
of
the
requirement_1
technology_1
and
why
use
slf4j
be
quality_attribute_2
than
plain
technology_7
if
you
t
why
i
suggest
you
connector_8
my
early
on
the
same
subject
technology_8
requirement_7
technology_1
in
today
s
world
of
web
component_5
and
the
iot
technology_8
have
become
the
go
to
technology_12
to
carry
connector_data_2
from
the
component_6
to
the
component_4
they
have
replace
the
connector_data_3
a
the
most
prefer
way
to
transfer
connector_data_2
in
a
component_7
independent
way
unfortunately
jdk
doesn
t
have
a
technology_8
technology_1
but
there
be
many
quality_attribute_2
third
party
technology_1
that
allow
you
to
both
requirement_7
and
create
technology_8
connector_data_4
technology_9
and
technology_13
a
technology_2
web
developer
should
be
familiar
with
at
least
one
of
these
technology_1
if
you
want
to
more
about
technology_9
and
technology_14
i
suggest
go
through
technology_8
with
the
technology_2
component_8
from
udemy
unit
test
technology_1
unit
test
be
the
single
most
important
thing
that
separate
an
average
developer
from
a
quality_attribute_2
developer
programmer
often
be
give
excuse
for
not
connector_5
unit
test
but
the
most
common
excuse
for
avoid
unit
test
be
lack
of
experience
and
knowledge
of
popular
unit
test
technology_1
include
junit
mockito
and
powermock
i
have
a
goal
in
to
improve
my
knowledge
of
unit
test
and
requirement_5
test
technology_1
junit
cucumber
robot
technology_4
and
a
few
others
i
have
also
sign
up
for
a
junit
and
mockito
crash
in
udemy
even
if
you
junit
and
the
basic
of
unit
test
you
want
to
refresh
and
upgrade
your
own
knowledge
general
purpose
technology_1
there
be
a
couple
of
quality_attribute_2
general
purpose
third
party
technology_1
quality_attribute_5
to
technology_2
developer
technology_15
technology_16
and
technology_17
i
always
include
these
technology_1
in
my
project
because
they
simplify
a
lot
of
connector_data_1
a
joshua
bloch
rightly
say
in
quality_attribute_3
technology_2
there
be
no
point
in
re
invent
the
wheel
we
should
prefer
use
try
and
test
technology_1
instead
of
connector_5
our
own
routine
every
now
and
then
it
s
quality_attribute_2
for
a
technology_2
developer
to
connector_3
themselves
familiar
with
technology_17
and
the
technology_15
technology_16
technology_1
technology_18
technology_1
one
thing
i
t
about
jdk
be
their
lack
of
support
for
technology_18
though
you
can
make
an
technology_18
connector_9
use
in
the
technology_2
netpackage
it
s
not
a
easy
or
seamless
to
use
open_source
third
party
technology_1
technology_15
httpclient
and
httpcore
though
jdk
be
bring
the
support
of
technology_18
and
quality_attribute_2
support
for
technology_18
i
strongly
suggest
all
technology_2
developer
connector_3
familiar
with
popular
technology_18
component_6
technology_1
include
httpclient
and
httpcore
you
can
also
connector_1
out
this
what
s
in
technology_2
and
more
to
more
about
jdk
s
technology_18
support
connector_data_3
requirement_7
technology_1
there
be
many
connector_data_3
requirement_7
technology_1
include
xerces
technology_19
jaxp
dom4j
and
xstream
xerces2
be
the
next
generation
of
high
requirement_6
fully
compliant
connector_data_3
requirement_9
in
the
technology_15
xerces
family
this
version
of
xerces
introduce
the
xerces
requirement_10
xni
a
complete
technology_4
for
build
requirement_9
component_9
and
configuration
that
be
extremely
modular
and
easy
to
component_10
the
technology_15
xerces2
requirement_9
be
the
reference
implementation
of
xni
but
other
requirement_9
component_11
configuration
and
requirement_9
can
be
connector_10
use
the
xerces
requirement_10
dom4j
be
another
quality_attribute_6
connector_data_3
technology_4
for
technology_2
component_3
if
you
want
to
more
about
connector_data_3
requirement_7
in
technology_2
i
suggest
you
take
a
look
at
the
technology_2
web
component_5
and
connector_data_3
online
on
udemy
connector_4
technology_1
believe
it
or
not
—
all
real
world
component_12
have
to
connector_11
with
office
in
some
form
or
another
many
component_3
need
to
provide
requirement_11
to
export
connector_data_5
in
and
if
you
have
to
do
same
from
your
technology_2
component_3
you
need
the
technology_15
technology_20
technology_3
this
be
a
very
rich
technology_1
that
allow
you
to
both
connector_8
and
connector_10
xl
from
a
technology_2
component_10
you
can
see
that
connector_12
for
a
work
example
of
connector_4
an
in
a
core
technology_2
component_3
bytecode
technology_1
if
you
be
connector_5
a
technology_4
or
technology_1
that
generate
or
connector_11
with
bytecodes
then
you
need
a
bytecode
technology_1
they
allow
you
to
connector_8
and
modify
bytecode
generate
by
an
component_3
some
of
the
popular
bytecode
technology_1
in
the
technology_2
world
be
javassist
and
cglib
nodep
the
javassist
technology_2
programming
assistant
make
technology_2
bytecode
manipulation
very
quality_attribute_7
it
be
a
technology_1
for
edit
bytecodes
in
technology_2
asm
be
another
useful
bytecode
edit
technology_1
if
you
be
not
familiar
with
bytecode
i
suggest
you
connector_1
the
introduction
to
technology_2
programmer
to
more
about
it
component_1
connector_9
pool
technology_1
if
you
be
connector_13
with
the
component_1
from
a
technology_2
component_3
but
not
use
component_1
connector_9
pool
technology_1
then
you
be
miss
something
since
create
component_1
connector_9
at
runtime
take
time
and
make
connector_data_6
component_13
slow
it
s
always
advise
to
use
db
connector_9
technology_1
some
of
the
popular
one
be
technology_16
pool
and
dbcp
in
a
web
component_3
it
s
web
component_4
generally
provide
these
requirement_11
but
in
core
technology_2
component_3
you
need
to
include
these
connector_9
pool
technology_1
into
your
classpath
to
use
the
component_1
connector_9
pool
if
you
want
to
more
about
technology_21
and
the
connector_9
pool
in
a
web
component_3
i
suggest
you
take
a
look
at
the
technology_22
servlet
and
technology_21
for
beginner
in
udemy
pattern_3
technology_1
similar
to
requirement_1
and
component_1
connector_9
pattern_3
be
also
a
common
feature
of
many
real
world
technology_2
component_3
technology_2
provide
technology_23
or
the
technology_2
pattern_3
component_14
that
s
not
part
of
jdk
for
this
component_11
you
need
to
include
a
separate
technology_23
jar
similarly
if
you
be
use
third
party
pattern_3
technology_12
technology_24
technology_25
then
you
need
to
use
a
third
party
jar
—
tibrv
jar
—
in
your
component_3
classpath
pdf
technology_1
similar
to
pdf
technology_1
be
another
ubiquitous
technology_26
if
you
need
to
support
pdf
requirement_11
in
your
component_3
export
connector_data_5
in
pdf
you
can
use
the
technology_27
and
technology_15
fop
technology_1
both
provide
useful
pdf
relate
requirement_11
but
technology_27
be
rich
and
quality_attribute_2
see
here
to
more
about
technology_27
date
and
time
technology_1
before
technology_2
jdk
s
connector_data_5
and
time
technology_1
have
so
many
flaw
because
they
be
not
component_15
quality_attribute_8
immutable
and
error
prone
many
technology_2
developer
rely
on
jodatime
for
connector_14
their
date
and
time
requirement
from
jdk
there
be
no
reason
to
use
joda
because
you
connector_3
all
that
requirement_11
in
the
jdk
s
date
and
time
technology_3
but
if
you
be
work
in
an
old
technology_2
version
then
jodatime
be
a
worth
technology_1
if
you
want
to
more
about
the
date
and
time
technology_3
i
suggest
you
connector_1
the
what
s
in
technology_2
on
udemy
it
provide
a
nice
overview
of
all
important
feature
of
technology_2
include
the
date
and
time
technology_3
collection
technology_1
even
though
jdk
have
a
rich
collection
technology_1
there
be
be
some
3rd
party
technology_1
that
provide
more
option
the
technology_15
technology_16
collection
goldman
sachs
collection
collection
and
trove
the
trove
technology_1
be
particularly
useful
because
it
provide
high
quality_attribute_9
regular
and
primitive
collection
for
technology_2
fastutil
be
another
similar
technology_3
it
extend
the
technology_2
collection
technology_4
by
provide
type
specific
connector_data_7
set
connector_data_8
and
priority
component_16
with
a
small
memory
footprint
fast
connector_15
and
insertion
it
also
provide
big
bit
set
and
connector_data_8
with
fast
practical
i
o
for
binary
and
text
component_2
the
javax
mail
and
technology_15
technology_16
both
provide
an
component_8
for
connector_16
an
from
technology_2
it
be
build
on
top
of
the
technology_28
technology_3
which
it
aim
to
simplify
technology_29
requirement_7
technology_1
similar
to
technology_8
and
technology_30
hmtl
be
another
common
technology_26
many
of
u
have
to
deal
with
thankfully
we
have
technology_31
which
greatly
simplify
work
with
technology_29
in
a
technology_2
component_3
you
can
use
technology_31
to
not
only
requirement_7
technology_29
but
also
to
create
technology_29
document
it
provide
a
very
convenient
component_8
for
extract
and
manipulate
connector_data_5
use
the
best
of

technology_1
i
really
love
in

component_1
technology_35
which
you
can
embed
in
your
technology_2
component_3
they
be
great
for
test
your
technology_34
script
and
run
unit
test
that
need
a

however
technology_35
be
not
the
only

you
also
have
technology_15
technology_36
and
hsql
to
choose
from
technology_21
troubleshoot
technology_1
there
be
some
quality_attribute_2
technology_21
extension
technology_1
that
exist
and
can
make
debug
easy
the
p6spy
this
be
a
technology_1
that
enable
component_1
connector_data_5
to
be
seamlessly
intercept
and
requirement_1
with
no
connector_18
to

you
can
use
these
to
requirement_1
technology_34
connector_19
and
their

be
a
way
of

technology_26
it
s
a
rich
