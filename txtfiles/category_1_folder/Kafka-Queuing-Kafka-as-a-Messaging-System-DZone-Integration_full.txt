the

experience
join
for
free
objective
in
this
we
will
the
concept
of
technology_3
technology_1
component_1
basically
pattern_4
in
technology_1
be
one
of
the
component_4
for
pattern_1
traditionally
so
let’s
begin
with
the
brief
introduction
to
technology_1
a
a
pattern_1
component_2
which
will
help
u
to
understand
technology_1
component_1
moreover
we
will
see
some
of
the
component_5
of
technology_1
component_1
to
clear
the
concept
quality_attribute_2
technology_1
a
a
pattern_1
component_2
there
be
two
component_4
for
pattern_1
traditionally
such
a
technology_1
pattern_4
and
pattern_5
in
technology_1
let’s
discus
both
technology_1
component_4
in
detail
technology_1
component_1
in
this
technology_1
pattern_1
component_2
a
pool
of
technology_1
component_6
connector_3
from
a
component_7
also
each
component_8
go
to
one
of
them
here
it
have
some
strength
a
well
a
some
weakness
it
strength
be
that
it
permit
u
to
divide
up
the
component_9
of
connector_data_1
over
multiple
component_10
instance
that
help
u
quality_attribute_3
our
component_9
but
it
weakness
be
it
be
not
multi
pattern_6
a
soon
a
one
component_9
connector_4
the
connector_data_1
it’s
go
technology_1
pattern_5
whereas
in
this
technology_1
pattern_5
component_2
the
component_8
be
pattern_7
to
all
the
technology_1
component_10
it
permit
u
to
pattern_7
connector_data_1
to
multiple
component_9
however
it
also
have
some
limitation
there
be
no
way
of
quality_attribute_4
component_9
because
here
every
connector_data_2
go
to
every
pattern_6
in
technology_1
these
two
concept
be
generalize
by
the
technology_1
component_10
group
however
the
component_10
group
in
technology_1
permit
u
to
divide
up
component_9
over
a
collection
of
component_9
with
a
technology_1
component_1
here
the
collection
of
component_11
refer
to
the
member
of
the
component_10
group
moreover
technology_1
permit
u
to
pattern_7
connector_data_3
to
multiple
component_10
group
with
technology_1
publish
subscribe
so
the
benefit
of
kafka’s
component_12
be
both
these
property
be
quality_attribute_5
in
every
technology_1
topic
—it
can
quality_attribute_3
component_9
a
well
a
it
be
multi
pattern_6
hence
that
imply
we
do
not
have
to
select
one
or
the
other
technology_1
have
strong
order
guarantee
than
a
traditional
pattern_1
component_2
too
since
there
be
no
parallelism
in
the
component_9
in
the
traditional
component_2
technology_1
perform
it
well
with
the
notion
of
parallelism
because
technology_1
can
offer
both
order
guarantee
and
load
balance
over
a
pool
of
component_10
component_9
need
for
technology_1
pattern_4
one
of
technology_1
pattern_4
component_13
be
pattern_8
architecture
it
essentially
demand
some
sort
of
connector_data_2
pattern_4
component_2
let’s
understand
pattern_8
architecture
first
it
be
a
concept
of
decouple
an
interconnect
monolithic
component_13
into
different
independent
a
well
a
external
connector_data_1
component_14
along
with
apis
thus
for
the
purpose
of
handle
pattern_3
external
component_15
and
inter
pattern_8
and
connector_5
connector_data_2
pattern_4
come
into
the
picture
in
addition
while
we
divide
a
big
monolithic
component_13
into
small
pattern_3
loosely
couple
at
that
time
the
pattern_9
component_16
connector_data_4
increase
which
be
amongst
those
pattern_3
and
the
number
of
connector_6
to
external
connector_data_1
component_14
also
increase
however
keep
this
huge
component_2
pattern_10
be
not
desirable
because
it
can
render
the
entire
component_13
unresponsive
also
it
can
defeat
the
whole
purpose
of
divide
into
pattern_3
in
the
first
place
hence
have
technology_1
at
that
time
make
the
whole
connector_data_1
flow
easy
because
it
be
quality_attribute_6
highly
fault
tolerant
and
also
it
have
constant
pattern_11
of
pattern_12
technology_4
through
component_17
technology_5
so
it
make
it
quality_attribute_7
to
work
connector_data_2
pattern_4
in
ml
solution
pipeline
apart
from
that
we
can
also
use
technology_1
pattern_4
for
the
various
ml
solution
pipeline
however
ml
solution
be
build
a
a
component_18
on
the
component_19
side
requirement_7
web
—
→an
component_16
component_7
and
the
component_3
—
→machine_learning
blackbox
however
ml
black
component_20
be
very
compute
heavy
and
also
it’s
not
practically
easy
to
have
those
connector_data_5
on
a
pattern_13
pattern_10
mode
moreover
all
the
connector_data_5
can
be
in
a
component_1
and
configure
component_10
component_16
to
take
those
connector_data_5
one
by
one
and
fee
them
into
the
ml
black
component_20
in
this
scenario
so
while
it
come
to
compute
intensive
connector_data_6
this
pipeline
can
easily
handle
such
a
recognize
connector_data_7
from
thousand
of
image
that
might
take
considerable
time
even
without
miss
any
connector_data_8
basically
pattern_3
quality_attribute_8
into
container
such
a
by
fault
tolerant
quality_attribute_6
cluster
of
technology_1
pattern_12
technology_4
it
be
mediate
and
use
a
technology_5
it
pattern_14
it
which
seem
a
way
of
enterprising
development
so
this
be
all
about
technology_1
component_1
technology_1
a
a
pattern_1
component_2
hope
you
our
explanation
conclusion
hence
we
have
see
the
complete
concept
of
technology_1
component_1
moreover
we
discus
why
technology_1
a
a
connector_data_2
component_1
along
with
this
we
the
two
component_12
technology_1
component_1
and
technology_1
publish
subscribe
also
we
saw
why
we
need
technology_1
component_1
lastly
we
discus
connector_data_2
pattern_4
in
ml
solution
pipeline
