2015data
component_4
have
mostly
focus
on
the
passive
storage
of
connector_data_1
phrase
“data
warehouse”
or
“data
lake”
or
even
the
ubiquitous
“data
store”
all
evoke
place
connector_data_1
go
to
sit
but
in
the
last
few
year
a
style
of
component_5
and
architecture
have
emerge
which
be
build
not
around
passive
storage
but
around
the
flow
of
real
time
connector_data_1
connector_2
this
have
become
a
central
architectural
element
of
silicon
valley’s
technology_6
requirement_4
many
of
the
large
of
these
have
build
themselves
around
real
time
connector_3
a
a
kind
of
central
nervous
component_5
that
connector_4
component_6
and
connector_data_1
component_5
and
make
quality_attribute_2
in
real
time
a
connector_2
of
everything
happen
in
the
requirement_3
you
can
easily
find
example
of
how
these
architecture
be
use
at
requirement_4
uber
ebay
netflix
yelp
or
virtually
any
other
modern
technology_6
requirement_4
at
the
same
time
a
whole
ecosystem
have
emerge
around
component_7
real
time
connector_data_1
connector_2
often
relate
to
technology_6
technology_2
storm
samza
flink
or
spark’s
connector_1

though
there
be
a
lot
of
excitement
not
everyone

how
to
fit
these
technology_6
into
their
technology_6
technology_7
or
how
to
put
it
to
use
in
practical
component_8
this
guide
be
go
to
discus
our
experience
with
real
time
connector_data_1
connector_3
and
what
be
require
to
be
successful
with
this
area
of
technology_6
all
of
this
be
base
on
real
experience
we
spend
the
last
five
year
build
technology_1
technology_2
transition
linkedin
to
a
fully
connector_2
base
architecture
and
help
a
number
of
silicon
valley
tech
requirement_4
do
the
same
thing
the
first
part
of
the
guide
will
give
a
high
level
overview
of
what
we
come
to
connector_data_2
an
“event
connector_1
platform”
a
central
hub
for
real
time
connector_3
of
connector_data_1
it
will
cover
the
what
and
why
of
this
idea
the
second
part
will
dive
into
a
lot
of
specific
and
give
advice
on
how
to
put
this
into
practice
effectively
but
first
what
be
an
connector_1
component_1
recommend
content
jay
kreps
confluent
ceo
and
technology_1
technology_2
co
creator
provide
an
introduction
to
technology_1
technology_2
and
how
it
serve
a
a
foundation
for
connector_1
connector_data_1
pipeline
and
component_6
that
connector_5
and
component_7
real
time
connector_data_1
connector_2
watch
the
component_9
of
his
online
talk
the
connector_1
component_1
a
clean
well
light
place
for
we
build
technology_1
technology_2
at
linkedin
with
a
specific
purpose
in
mind
to
serve
a
a
central
hub
of
connector_data_1
connector_2
but
why
do
this
there
be
a
few
motivation
the
first
problem
have
to
do
with
build
real
time
component_8
we
have
a
pattern_2
pattern_3
for
build
connector_data_3
connector_6
component_10
but
we
find
that
there
be
a
large
of
component_6
for
which
this
be
a
poor
fit
in
particular
component_6
that
connector_7
asynchronously
off
of
activity
elsewhere
in
the
component_5
such
a
our
newsfeed
our
component_5
and
other
connector_data_1
drive
feature
these
type
of
component_3
be
different
from
the
web
and
requirement_5
component_11
we
build
because
they
do
their
core
work
decouple
from
the
ui
action
that
connector_7
them
but
this
be
not
possible
to
connector_8
with
transient
pattern_2
connector_data_2
we
try
instead
to
adopt
off
the
shelf
pattern_4
component_4
such
a
technology_8
but
find
these
very
difficult
to
manage
and
quality_attribute_1
the
second
problem
be
around
dataflow
the
pip
of
connector_data_1
between
component_5
we
have
lot
of
connector_data_1
component_5
relational
oltp
component_12
technology_1
technology_9
technology_10
a
search
component_5
pattern_5
component_5
technology_11
component_13
and
derive
key
requirement_6
component_13
each
of
these
need
quality_attribute_3
feed
of
connector_data_1
in
a
geographically
quality_attribute_4
environment
i’ll
connector_data_2
this
problem
“data
requirement_7
”
though
we
could
also
connector_data_2
it
technology_5
i’ll
talk
a
little
about
how
these
idea
develop
at
linkedin
at
first
we
didn’t
realize
that
these
problem
be
connector_9
at
all
our
approach
be
very
hoc
we
build
jerry
rig
pip
between
component_4
and
component_6
on
an
a
need
basis
and
shoe
horned
any
pattern_6
component_7
into
connector_data_3
connector_6
web
component_10
over
time
this
set
up
connector_10
more
and
more
complex
a
we
end
up
build
pipeline
between
all
kind
of
different
component_5
each
of
the
pipeline
be
problematic
in
it
own
way
our
pipeline
for
requirement_8
connector_data_1
be
quality_attribute_5
but
lossy
and
could
only
connector_11
connector_data_1
with
high
quality_attribute_6
our
pipeline
between
technology_3
instance
be
fast
exact
and
real
time
but
not
quality_attribute_5
and
not
quality_attribute_2
to
non
technology_3
component_5
our
pipeline
of
technology_3
connector_data_1
for
technology_9
be
periodic
csv
dumps—high
quality_attribute_7
but
pattern_7
our
pipeline
of
connector_data_1
to
our
search
component_5
be
low
quality_attribute_6
but
unscalable
and
tie
directly
to
the
component_12
our
pattern_4
component_4
be
low
quality_attribute_6
but
unreliable
and
unscalable
a
we

connector_data_1
center
geographically
quality_attribute_4
around
the
world
we
have
to
build
out
geographical
pattern_8
for
each
of
these
connector_data_1
flow
a
each
of
these
component_4
quality_attribute_1
the
support
pipeline
have
to
quality_attribute_1
with
them
build
quality_attribute_8
duct
tape
pipeline
have
be
easy
enough
but
quality_attribute_9
these
and
operationalizing
them
be
an
enormous
effort
i
felt
that
my
team
which
be
suppose
to
be
make
up
of
quality_attribute_4
component_4
engineer
be
really
act
more
a
quality_attribute_4
component_5
plumber
bad
the
complexity
mean
that
the
connector_data_1
be
always
unreliable
our
report
be
untrustworthy
derive
index
and
connector_12
be
questionable
and
everyone
spend
a
lot
of
time
battle
connector_data_1
quality
issue
of
all
kind
i
remember
an
incident
where
we
connector_13
two
component_4
that
have
similar
connector_data_1
and
find
a
discrepancy
we
connector_13
a
third
to
try
to
determine
which
of
these
be
correct
and
find
that
it
match
neither
at
the
same
time
we
weren’t
ship
connector_data_1
from
place
to
place
we
also
want
to
do
thing
with
it
technology_9
have
give
u
a
component_1
for
pattern_7
component_7
connector_data_1
archival
and
hoc
component_7
and
this
have
be
successful
but
we
lack
an
analogous
component_1
for
low
quality_attribute_6
component_7
most
component_14
and
requirement_9
face
component_6
be
difficult
to
build
in
a
pattern_7
fashion
a
this
require
pip
large
amount
of
connector_data_1
into
and
out
of
technology_9
we
need
something
pattern_6
from
the
component_14
but
fast
but
these
type
of
component_6
have
no
natural
home
in
our
infrastructure
technology_7
and
we
mostly
end
up
try
to
cram
these
requirement
into
component_12
and
connector_data_3
connector_6
component_3
that
be
a
particularly
unnatural
fit
after
struggle
with
the
connector_data_4
sprawl
for
year
we
decide
in

to
focus
on
build
a
component_5
that
would
focus
on
component_15
connector_3
of
connector_data_1
this
would
allow
u
to
both
transport
these
connector_3
of
connector_data_1
to
all
the
component_4
and
component_6
that
need
them
a
well
a
build
rich
real
time
component_6
on
top
of
them
this
be
the
origin
of
technology_1
technology_2
we
imagine
something
this
for
a
long
time
we
didn’t
really
have
a
name
for
what
we
be
do
we
connector_14
it
“kafka
stuff”
or
“the
global
connector_15
requirement_8
thingy”
but
over
time
we
come
to
connector_data_2
this
kind
of
connector_data_1
“stream
data”
and
the
concept
of
manage
this
centrally
an
“event
connector_1
component_1
”
our
connector_data_4
component_5
architecture
go
from
the
ugly
spaghetti
of
pipeline
i
describe
before
to
a
much
clean
connector_2
centric
component_5
a
modern
connector_2
centric
connector_data_1
architecture
build
around
technology_1
technology_2
in
this
setup
technology_2
act
a
a
kind
of
universal
pipeline
for
connector_data_1
each
component_5
can
fee
into
this
central
pipeline
or
be
feed
by
it
component_6
or
connector_2
processor
can
tap
into
it
to
create

derive
connector_2
which
in
turn
can
be
feed
back
into
the
various
component_4
for
serve
continuous
feed
of
well
form
connector_data_1
act
a
a
kind
of
lingua
franca
across
component_5
component_8
and
connector_data_1
center
for
example
if
a
component_14
connector_data_5
their
profile
that
update
might
flow
into
our
connector_2
component_7
pattern_3
where
it
would
be
component_7
to
standardize
their
requirement_4
connector_data_6
geography
and
other
attribute
from
there
that
connector_2
might
flow
into
search
index
and
our
social
graph
for
query
into
a
recommendation
component_5
for
match
all
of
this
would
happen
in
millisecond
this
same
flow
would
load
into
technology_9
to
provide
that
connector_data_1
to
the
requirement_10
environment
this
usage
at
linkedin
grow
to
phenomenal
quality_attribute_1
today
at
linkedin
technology_2
handle
over

trillion
per
day
spread
over
a
number
of
connector_data_1
center
it
become
the
technology_12
for
connector_data_1
flow
between
component_4
of
all
kind
the
core
pipeline
for
technology_9
connector_data_1
and
the
hub
for
connector_2
component_7
and
real
time
component_8
since
technology_2
be
open_source
this
usage
spread
beyond
linkedin
into
requirement_4
of
all
kind
do
similar
thing
in
the
rest
of
this
i’m
go
to
outline
a
few
detail
about
this
connector_2
centric
world
pattern_9
how
it
work
and
what
problem
it
solve
connector_1
connector_data_1
most
of
what
a
requirement_3
do
can
be
think
of
a
connector_3
of

sometimes
this
be
obvious
retail
have
connector_3
of
order
sale
shipment
requirement_11
adjustment

and
so
on
finance
have
order
requirement_12
requirement_11
and
other
financial
time
series
web
sit
have
connector_3
of
click
impression
search
and
so
on
big
component_4
have
connector_3
of
connector_data_3
quality_attribute_10
error
component_16
metric
and
requirement_8
indeed
one
pattern_9
of
a
requirement_3
be
a
a
kind
of
connector_data_1
component_7
component_5
that
take
various
input
connector_3
and
produce
correspond
output
connector_3
and
maybe
some
physical
quality_attribute_11
along
the
way
this
pattern_9
of
connector_data_1
can
seem
a
little
foreign
to
people
who
be
more
accustomed
to
think
of
connector_data_1
a
row
in
component_12
rather
than
a

so
let’s
look
at
a
few
practical
aspect
of
connector_data_1
the
rise
of
and
connector_3
your
component_12
connector_12
the
current
state
of
your
connector_data_1
but
the
current
state
be
always
cause
by
some
action
that
take
place
in
the
past
the
action
be
the

your
inventory
component_17
be
the
state
that
connector_data_7
from
the
purchase
and
sale
that
have
be
make
bank
balance
be
the
connector_data_4
of
credit
and
debit
and
the
quality_attribute_6
graph
for
your
web
component_18
be
an
aggregation
of
the
connector_2
of
technology_13
connector_data_3
time
much
of
what
people
refer
to
when
they
talk
about
“big_data”
be
really
the
act
of
capture
these
that
previously
weren’t
component_9
anywhere
and
put
them
to
use
for
analysis
optimization
and
decision
make
in
some
sense
these
be
the
other
half
of
the
story
the
component_12
component_19
don’t
tell
they
be
the
story
of
what
the
requirement_3
do
connector_data_1
requirement_13
have
always
be
present
in
finance
where
requirement_12
tick
requirement_12
indicator
requirement_14
and
other
time
series
connector_data_1
be
naturally
think
of
a
connector_2
but
the
tech
requirement_15
popularize
the
most
modern
incarnation
of
technology_6
for
capture
and
use
of
this
connector_data_1
transform
the
connector_2
of
click
and
impression
into
a
multi
billion
dollar
requirement_3
in
the
web
space
connector_data_1
be
often
connector_14
“log
data”
because
lack
any
proper
infrastructure
for
their

requirement_8
be
often
where
the
be
put
component_4
technology_9
be
often
describe
a
be
for
“log
processing”
but
that
usage
might
be
quality_attribute_11
describe
a
pattern_7
storage
and
component_7
web
requirement_4
be
probably
the
early
to
do
this
because
the
component_7
of
capture
connector_data_1
in
a
web
be
very
easy
a
few
line
of
can
track
that
component_20
what
component_21
on
a
do
a
a
connector_data_4
a
single
component_22
load
or
requirement_5
screen
on
a
popular
be
likely
component_9
dozen
or
even
hundred
of
these
for
analysis
and
pattern_10
you
will
sometimes
hear
about
“machine
generate
data”
but
this
be
connector_data_1
by
another
name
in
some
sense
virtually
all
connector_data_1
be
component_16
generate
since
it
be
make
by
component_23
component_5
likewise
there
be
a
lot
of
talk
about
component_24
connector_data_1
and
the
“internet
of
things”
this
be
a
phrase
that
mean
a
lot
of
thing
to
different
people
but
a
large
part
of
the
promise
have
to
do
with
apply
the
same
connector_data_1
collection
and
requirement_16
of
big
web
component_4
to
industrial
component_25
and
component_26
quality_attribute_11
in
other
word
more
connector_2
component_12
be
connector_3
connector_3
be
an
obvious
fit
for
requirement_8
connector_data_1
or
thing
“orders”
“sales”
“clicks”
or
“trades”
that
be
obviously


but
most
people
you
probably
keep
much
of
your
connector_data_1
in
component_12
whether
relational
component_12
technology_3
technology_14
and
postgres
or

quality_attribute_4
component_12
technology_15
technology_16
and
technology_17
these
would
seem
at
first
to
be
far
remove
from
the
world
of
or
connector_2
but
in
fact
connector_data_1
in
component_12
can
also
be
think
of
a
an
connector_2
the
easy
way
to
understand
the
connector_2
representation
of
a
component_12
be
to
think
about
the
component_7
of
create
a
backup
or
standby
copy
of
a
component_12
a
naive
approach
to
do
this
might
be
to
connector_data_8
out
the
content
of
your
component_12
periodically
and
load
this
up
into
the
standby
component_12
if
we
do
this
only
infrequently
and
our
connector_data_1
isn’t
too
large
than
take
a
full
connector_data_8
of
all
the
connector_data_1
be
quite
feasible
in
fact
many
backup
and
technology_5
do
exactly
this
however
this
approach
won’t
quality_attribute_1
a
we
increase
the
frequency
of
the
connector_data_1
capture
if
we
do
a
full
connector_data_8
of
connector_data_1
twice
a
day
it
will
take
twice
the
component_5
resource
and
if
we
do
it
hourly

time
a
much
the
obvious
approach
to
make
this
more
quality_attribute_12
be
to
take
a
“diff”
of
what
have
connector_16
and
fetch
row
that
have
be
newly
create
update
or
delete
since
our
last
diff
be
take
use
this

if
we
take
our
diffs
twice
a
often
the
diffs
themselves
will
connector_10
roughly
half
a
big
and
the
component_5
resource
will
remain
more
or
le
the
same
a
we
increase
the
frequency
of
our
connector_data_1
capture
why
not
take
this
component_7
to
the
limit
and
take
our
diffs
more
and
more
frequently
if
we
do
this
what
we
will
be
leave
with
be
a
continuous
sequence
of
single
row
connector_16
this
kind
of
connector_2
be
connector_14
connector_16
capture
and
be
a
common
part
of
many
component_12
component_4
technology_3
have
xstreams
and
goldengate
technology_14
have
binlog
pattern_8
and
postgres
have
logical
requirement_8
connector_1
pattern_8
by
publish
the
component_12
connector_17
into
the
connector_1
component_1
you
this
to
the
other
set
of
connector_2
you
can
use
these
connector_3
to
synchronize
other
component_4
a
technology_9
cluster
a
replica
component_12
or
a
search
index
or
you
can
fee
these
connector_17
into
component_6
or
connector_2
processor
to
directly
compute
thing
off
the
connector_16
these
connector_17
be
in
turn
publish
back
a
connector_3
that
be
quality_attribute_2
to
all
the
quality_attribute_13
component_5
what
be
an
connector_1
component_1
for
an
connector_1
component_1
have
two
primary
us
connector_2
component_7
it
enable
continuous
real
time
component_6
build
to
technology_18
to
component_7
or
transform
connector_2
this
be
the
natural
evolution
of
the
world
of
requirement_17
pattern_4
which
focus
on
single
connector_data_9
delivery
connector_2
component_7
give
you
that
and
more
connector_data_1
requirement_7
the
connector_1
component_1
capture
connector_3
of
or
connector_data_1
connector_17
and
feed
these
to
other
connector_data_1
component_4
such
a
relational
component_12
key
requirement_6
component_13
technology_9
or
the
connector_data_1
requirement_10
this
be
a
connector_1
version
of
exist
connector_data_1
movement
technology_6
such
a
technology_5
component_5
the
connector_1
component_1
act
a
a
central
hub
for
connector_data_1
connector_2
component_6
that
quality_attribute_13
don’t
need
to
be
concern
with
the
detail
of
the
original
connector_data_1
component_2
all
connector_3
look
the
same
it
also
act
a
a
buffer
between
these
systems—the
pattern_11
of
connector_data_1
doesn’t
need
to
be
concern
with
the
various
component_4
that
will
eventually
connector_5
and
load
the
connector_data_1
this
mean
component_27
of
connector_data_1
can
come
and
go
and
be
fully
decouple
from
the
component_2
if
you
adopt
a
component_5
you
can
do
this
by
tap
into
your
exist
connector_data_1
connector_3
rather
than
instrument
each
individual
component_2
component_5
and
component_8
for
each
possible
destination
the
connector_3
all
look
the
same
whether
they
originate
from
an
component_8
a
requirement_8

a
component_12
technology_9
a
connector_2
component_7
component_5
or
wherever
else
this
make

a
connector_data_1
component_5
a
much
cheap
proposition—it
need
only
quality_attribute_13
with
the
connector_1
component_1
not
with
every
possible
connector_data_1
component_2
and
connector_18
directly
a
similar
story
be
important
for
technology_9
which
want
to
be
able
to
maintain
a
full
copy
of
all
the
connector_data_1
in
your
organization
and
act
a
a
“data
lake”
or
“enterprise
connector_data_1
hub”
directly
quality_attribute_13
each
connector_data_1
component_2
with
technology_19
be
a
hugely
time
connector_19
proposition
and
the
end
connector_data_4
only
make
that
connector_data_1
quality_attribute_2
to
technology_9
this
type
of
connector_data_1
capture
isn’t
suitable
for
real
time
component_7
or
pattern_12
other
real
time
component_8
likewise
this
same
design
pipeline
can
run
in
reverse
technology_9
and
the
connector_data_1
requirement_10
environment
can
publish
out
connector_data_7
that
need
to
flow
into
appropriate
component_4
for
serve
in
requirement_9
face
component_8
the
connector_2
component_7
use
requirement_2
play
off
the
connector_data_1
requirement_7
use
requirement_2
all
the
connector_3
that
be
capture
for
loading
into
technology_9
for
archival
be
equally
quality_attribute_2
for
continuous
“stream
processing”
a
connector_data_1
be
capture
in
the
connector_2
the
connector_data_7
of
the
connector_2
component_7
be
a

derive
connector_2
this
connector_2
look
any
other
connector_2
and
be
quality_attribute_2
for
loading
in
all
the
connector_data_1
component_4
that
have
quality_attribute_13
with
the
connector_1
component_1
once
a
connector_2
of
connector_data_1
be
in
technology_2
there
be
a
number
of
option
for
build
real
time
component_6
around
it
this
connector_2
component_7
can
be
do
use
quality_attribute_8
component_8
that
connector_20
and
connector_21
connector_3
of
connector_data_1
use
technology_2
a
a
pattern_4
pattern_3
however
technology_2
requirement_13
also
provide
a
very
powerful
connector_2
component_7
technology_20
that
allow
easily
build
state
of
the
art
connector_2
component_7
component_6
with
no
additional
move
part
need
beyond
the
technology_2
cluster
technology_2
can
also
quality_attribute_13
with
external
connector_2
component_7
pattern_3
such
a
storm
samza
flink
or
technology_21
connector_2
connector_2
component_7
act
a
both
a
way
to
develop
real
time
component_6
but
it
be
also
directly
part
of
the
connector_data_1
requirement_7
usage
a
well
quality_attribute_13
component_4
often
require
some
munging
of
connector_data_1
connector_3
in
between
what
do
an
connector_1
component_1
need
to
do
i’ve
discuss
a
number
of
different
technology_2
use
requirement_2
each
of
these
technology_2
use
requirement_2
have
a
correspond
connector_2
but
each
connector_2
have
slightly
different
requirements—some
need
to
be
fast
some
high
quality_attribute_7
some
need
to
quality_attribute_1
out
etc
if
we
want
to
make
a
single
component_1
that
can
handle
all
of
these
us
what
will
it
need
to
do
i
think
the
follow
be
the
key
capability
of
an
connector_1
component_1
pub
sub
an
connector_1
component_1
must
enable
real
time
publish
and
subscribe
to
connector_data_1
connector_3
at
quality_attribute_1
in
particular
it
must
provide
single
digit
quality_attribute_6
so
it
be
quality_attribute_14
by
real
time
component_6
it
must
be
able
to
handle
high
volume
connector_data_1
connector_3
such
a
be
common
for
requirement_8
connector_data_1
iot
or
other
usage
across
many
component_6
in
a
requirement_4
it
must
enable
requirement_7
with
passive
connector_data_1
component_4
such
a
component_12
a
well
a
component_6
that
actively
publish
component_7
it
must
enable
the
real
time
connector_2
component_7
of
connector_3
at
quality_attribute_1
must
support
modern
connector_2
component_7
capability
to
power
real
time
component_6
or
connector_1
transformation
component_13
it
must
be
able
to
quality_attribute_15
component_13
connector_3
of
connector_data_1
at
quality_attribute_1
in
particular
it
must
give
strong
pattern_8
and
order
guarantee
to
be
able
to
handle
critical
connector_data_5
such
a
replicate
the
changelog
of
a
component_12
to
a
replica
component_13
a
search
index
connector_22
this
connector_data_1
in
order
and
without
loss
it
must
be
able
to
buffer
or
persist
connector_data_1
for
long
period
of
time
this
enable
requirement_7
with
pattern_7
component_4
such
a
a
connector_data_1
requirement_10
that
only
load
connector_data_1
periodically
a
well
a
allow
connector_2
component_7
component_4
to
reprocess
feed
when
their
component_28
connector_16
this
storage
must
quality_attribute_1
cheaply
enough
to
make
the
component_1
viable
at
quality_attribute_1
an
connector_1
component_1
need
to
do
all
of
these
while
remain
continuously
quality_attribute_2
and
be
use
at
requirement_4
wide
quality_attribute_1
this
type
of
component_1
usually
begin
with
a
single
component_8
but
the
ability
to
serve
a
single
component_8
isn’t
sufficient
since
the
power
of
the
connector_1
component_1
grow
a
more
component_6
connector_23
it
it
need
to
be
able
to
grow
to
support
the
full
set
of
component_6
and
connector_data_1
flow
that
power
a
modern
digital
requirement_4
what
be
technology_1
technology_2
technology_1
technology_2
be
a
quality_attribute_4
component_5
design
for
connector_2
it
be
build
to
be
fault
tolerant
high
quality_attribute_7
horizontally
quality_attribute_5
and
allow
geographically
quality_attribute_4
connector_data_1
connector_3
and
connector_2
component_7
component_8
technology_2
be
often
categorize
a
a
pattern_4
component_5
and
it
serve
a
similar
role
but
provide
a
fundamentally
different
abstraction
the
key
abstraction
in
technology_2
be
a
pattern_13
connector_15
requirement_8
of
update
a
component_29
of
connector_data_1
connector_24
a
connector_2
of
component_20
which
be
append
to
this
requirement_8
and
any
number
of
component_27
can
continually
connector_2
these
connector_data_5
off
the
tail
of
the
requirement_8
with
millisecond
quality_attribute_6
each
of
these
connector_data_1
component_27
have
it
own
position
in
the
requirement_8
and
advance
independently
this
allow
a
quality_attribute_3
order
connector_2
of
connector_data_5
to
be
quality_attribute_4
to
each
component_26
the
requirement_8
can
be
sharded
and
spread
over
a
cluster
of
component_16
and
each
shard
be
replicate
for
fault
tolerance
this
give
a
component_15
for
parallel
order
consumption
which
be
key
to
kafka’s
use
a
a
connector_16
capture
component_5
for
component_12
connector_data_5
which
must
be
connector_11
in
order
technology_2
be
build
a
a
modern
quality_attribute_4
component_5
connector_data_1
be
replicate
and
component_30
over
a
cluster
of
component_31
that
can
grow
and
shrink
transparently
to
the
component_6
use
the
cluster
component_27
of
connector_data_1
can
be
quality_attribute_1
out
over
a
pool
of
component_31
a
well
and
automatically
adapt
to
failure
in
the
connector_19
component_7
a
key
aspect
of
the
technology_2
architecture
be
that
it
handle
persistence
well
a
technology_2
pattern_14
can
component_13
many
tb
of
connector_data_1
this
allow
usage
pattern_15
that
would
be
impossible
in
a
traditional
component_12
a
technology_9
cluster
or
other
offline
component_5
that
be
feed
off
technology_2
can
go
down
for
quality_attribute_16
and
come
back
hour
or
day
late
confident
that
all
connector_17
have
be
safely
persist
in
the
up
connector_2
technology_2
cluster
when
synchronize
from
component_12
component_19
it
be
possible
to
initialize
a
“full
dump”
of
the
component_12
so
that
downstream
component_27
of
connector_data_1
have
connector_25
to
the
full
connector_data_1
set
these
feature
make
technology_2
applicable
well
beyond
the
us
of
traditional
requirement_17
pattern_4
component_5
pattern_16
component_6
since
we
build
technology_2
a
an
open_source
project
we
have
have
the
opportunity
to
work
closely
with
requirement_4
who
put
it
to
use
and
to
see
the
general
pattern_15
of
technology_2
adoption
how
it
first
be
adopt
and
how
it
role
quality_attribute_17
over
time
in
their
architecture
the
initial
adoption
be
usually
for
a
single
particularly
large
quality_attribute_1
component_32
that
require
quality_attribute_18
beyond
what
a
traditional
pattern_4
component_5
can
handle
from
there
though
the
usage
spread
all
connector_3
in
technology_2
be
innately
multi
pattern_17
a
topic
in
technology_2
can
be
connector_5
by
one
component_32
or
many
this
mean
that
connector_3
in
technology_2
naturally
draw
in
additional
component_6
that
need
that
connector_data_1
exist
component_6
will
end
up
tap
into
the
connector_3
to
technology_18
to
what
be
happen
more
intelligently
and
component_6
will
be
build
to
harness
intelligence
derive
off
these
connector_2
these
component_6
tend
to
draw
in
their
own
connector_data_1
connector_2
which
in
turn
draw
in
more
component_8
a
long
a
these
connector_data_1
connector_3
be
well
pattern_13
this
can
be
a
powerful
virtuous
cycle
that
build
a
rich
connector_1
ecosystem
for
example
at
linkedin
we
originally
begin
capture
a
connector_2
of
pattern_9
to
display
on
the
a
one
of
many
feed
to
connector_11
to
technology_9
and
our
relational
connector_data_1
requirement_10
however
this
technology_5
centric
use
requirement_2
soon
become
one
of
many
and
the
connector_2
of
pattern_9
over
time
begin
to
be
use
by
a
variety
of
component_5
note
that
the
component_8
that
show
didn’t
need
any
particular
modification
to
quality_attribute_13
with
these
other
us
it
produce
the
connector_2
of
that
be
pattern_9
the
other
component_6
tap
into
this
connector_2
to
their
own
component_7
likewise
when
pattern_9
begin
happen
in
other
applications—mobile
applications—these
be

to
the
global
fee
of

the
downstream
processor
don’t
need
to
quality_attribute_13
with
upstream
component_2
how
do
an
connector_1
component_1
relate
to
exist
thing
let’s
talk
briefly
about
the
relationship
this
connector_1
component_1
concept
have
with
other
thing
in
the
world
pattern_4
an
connector_1
component_1
be
similar
to
an
requirement_17
pattern_4
system—it
connector_26
connector_data_10
and
quality_attribute_4
them
to
interest
pattern_17
you
consider
it
a
a
kind
of
pattern_4


if
you

but
there
be
three
important
difference
pattern_4
component_4
be
typically
run
in
one
off
deployment
for
different
component_8
because
an
connector_1
component_1
run
a
a
cluster
and
can
quality_attribute_1
a
central
instance
can
support
an
entire
datacenter
pattern_4
component_4
do
a
poor
of
connector_27
connector_data_1
and
this
limit
them
to
connector_3
which
have
only
real
time
consumption
however
many
requirement_7
require
more
than
this
pattern_4
component_4
do
not
provide
semantics
that
be
easily
quality_attribute_19
with
rich
connector_2
component_7
therefor
they
can’t
really
be
use
a
the
basis
for
the
component_7
part
of
an
connector_1
component_1
in
other
word
an
connector_1
component_1
be
a
pattern_4
component_5
whose
role
have
be
re
think
at
a
requirement_4
wide
quality_attribute_1
connector_data_1
requirement_7
technology_22
an
connector_1
component_1
do
a
lot
to
make
requirement_7
between
component_4
easy
however
it
role
be
different
from
a
technology_22
informatica
an
connector_1
component_1
be
a
true
component_1
that
any
other
component_5
can
choose
to
tap
into
and
many
component_6
can
build
around
one
practical
area
of
overlap
be
that
by
make
connector_data_1
quality_attribute_2
in
a
uniform
technology_23
in
a
single
place
with
a
common
connector_2
abstraction
many
of
the
routine
connector_data_1
clean
up
connector_data_11
can
be
avoid
entirely
i’ll
dive
into
this
more
in
the
second
part
of
this

requirement_17
component_10
bus
i
think
an
connector_1
component_1
embody
many
of
the
idea
of
an
requirement_17
component_10
bus
but
with
quality_attribute_11
implementation
the
challenge
of
requirement_17
component_10
bus
adoption
have
be
the
couple
of
transformation
of
connector_data_1
with
the
bus
itself
some
of
the
challenge
of
requirement_17
component_10
bus
adoption
be
that
much
of
the
component_28
require
for
transformation
be
bake
into
the
connector_data_9
bus
itself
without
a
quality_attribute_11
component_15
for
pattern_18
requirement_1
deployment
and
of
this
component_28
the
advantage
of
an
connector_1
component_1
be
that
transformation
be
fundamentally
decouple
from
the
connector_2
itself
this
can
live
in
component_6
or
connector_2
component_7
connector_data_12
allow
team
to
iterate
at
their
own
pace
without
a

also

what
do
this
look
in
practice
one
of
the
interest
thing
about
this
concept
be
that
it
isn’t
an
idea
we
have
actually
have
the
opportunity
to
“do
the
experiment”
we
spend
the
last
five
year
build
technology_2
and
help
requirement_4
put
an
connector_1
component_1
to
use
at
a
number
of
silicon
valley
requirement_4
today
you
can
see
this
concept
in
action—everything
that
happen
in
the
requirement_3
from
component_14
activity
to
transaction
component_7
to
component_12
connector_17
to
operational
pattern_5
be
capture
in
real
time
connector_3
that
be
universally
quality_attribute_2
to
subscribe
to
and
component_7
in
real
time
what
be
interest
about
this
be
that
what
begin
a
quality_attribute_8
plumb
quickly
quality_attribute_17
into
something
much
more
these
connector_data_1
connector_3
begin
to
act
a
a
kind
of
central
nervous
component_5
that
component_6
organize
themselves
around
the
second
half
of
this
guide
will
cover
some
of
the
practical
aspect
of
build
out
and
manage
an
connector_1
component_1
next
step
we
think
this
technology_6
be
connector_16
how
connector_data_1
be
put
to
use
in
requirement_4
we
be
build
confluent
component_1
a
distribution
of
technology_2
aim
at
help
requirement_4
adopt
and
use
it
a
an
connector_1
component_1
we
think
confluent
component_1
represent
the
best
place
to
connector_10
start
if
you
be
think
about
put
an
connector_1
component_1
to
use
in
your
organization
whether
for
a
single
component_32
or
at
requirement_4
wide
quality_attribute_1
there
be
a
few
other
resource
that
be
useful
i
have
previously
connector_28
a
and
short
book
about
some
of
the
idea
in

relationship
between
