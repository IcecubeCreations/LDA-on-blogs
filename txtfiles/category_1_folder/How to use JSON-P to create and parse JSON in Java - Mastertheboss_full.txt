by
f
marchioni
this
show
how
to
use
technology_2
component_4
jsr
technology_20
part
of
the
jakarta
ee
specification
in
general
term
there
be
two
component_5
to
handle
technology_2
in
technology_3
technology_1
p
technology_1
component_4
jsr
specify
a
very
low
level
component_4
technology_21
which
can
be
carry
out
with
two
component_6
for
technology_2
component_4
the
connector_data_1
component_7
component_2
and
the
connector_1
technology_20
technology_1
b
technology_1
bind
jsr
provide
a
bind
pattern_4
on
top
of
technology_1
p
make
it
easy
to
convert
connector_data_2
to
and
from
technology_1
if
you
want
an
overview
on
both
technology_20
we
recommend
connector_2
this
how
to
requirement_1
technology_2
in
technology_3
connector_3
start
with
technology_2
component_4
component_2
technology_1
p
be
split
into
two
core
apis
the
connector_1
component_2
javax
technology_1
connector_4
and
the
technology_2
connector_data_1
component_7
component_2
javax
technology_1
the
connector_1
component_2
be
use
to
requirement_1
jsonparser
and
generate
technology_2
connector_data_3
jsongenerator
the
connector_data_1
component_7
technology_20
which
be
a
quality_attribute_3
easy
to
use
component_2
connector_5
on
top
of
the
connector_1
technology_20
it
create
an
in
memory
tree
connector_data_4
of
the
technology_2
connector_data_3
firstly
let’s
see
a
basic
example
which
encode
some
technology_2
connector_data_3
in
various
technology_22
package
technology_23
sample

}
a
you
can
see
this
u
the
jsongenerator
to
define
a
technology_1

and
connector_7
it
to
the

use

if
you
don’t
have
it
instal
a

will
be
enough
use

in
the
second
example
we
be
use
the
jsonobjectbuilder
to
generate
a

}
to
create
these
connector_data_1
component_7
you
can
use
the
builder
pattern_6
jsonobjectbuilder
or
jsonarraybuilder
or
connector_9
them
from
an
input
component_10
inputstream
or
reader
use
jsonreader
you
can
then
connector_7
these
connector_data_1
component_6
to
an
output
component_10
outputstream
or
writer
use
the
jsonwriter
do
with
connector_data_1
connector_4
let’s
see
how
to
requirement_1
out
example
for
this
purpose
we
will
use
the
jsonparser
which
provide
connector_9
only
connector_10
to
technology_2
connector_data_3
in
a
connector_1
way
this
be
the
most
quality_attribute_4
way
for
connector_11
technology_2
connector_data_3
the
technology_1
contain
to
create
requirement_8
from
input
component_11
inputstream
and
reader
the
follow
example
demonstrate
how
to
create
a
requirement_8
from
a
stringreader
which
contain
the

package
