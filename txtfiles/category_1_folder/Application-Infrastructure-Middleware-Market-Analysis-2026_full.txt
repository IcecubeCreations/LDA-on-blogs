methodology
component_1
infrastructure
technology_1
aim
be
that
be
consider
a
a
midway
among
the
various
component_4
and
component_5
a
common
component_1
of
technology_1
be
to
allow
component_6
connector_3
for
connector_4
to
a
particular
component_7
to
connector_4
other
component_7
typically
technology_1
component_6
provide
pattern_1
component_3
so
that
different
component_4
can
connector_5
in
addition
technology_1
be
use
a
a
mediator
between
requirement_6
operate
component_8
and
component_1
it
provide
well

quality_attribute_2
solution
to
frequently
encounter
problem
such
a
heterogeneity
quality_attribute_3
quality_attribute_4
and
quality_attribute_5
thus
component_1
infrastructure
technology_1
aim
play
a
very
quality_attribute_6
role
in
component_1
requirement_7
in
various
requirement_4
in
recent
year
most
requirement_8
have
develop
component_4
that
run
simultaneously
in
order
to
accomplish
their
requirement_9
connector_data_2
more
appropriately
and
precisely
the
global
component_1
infrastructure
and
technology_1
aim
requirement_1
be
expand
at
a
rapid
pace
a
an
enabler
of

architecture
aim
have
successfully
establish
itself
and
be
increasingly
quality_attribute_7
a
a
base
technology_2
for
requirement_10
requirement_11
and
requirement_12
technology_2
along
with
requirement_13
computing
further
with
requirement_6
become
increasingly
pervasive
technology_1
appear
a
a
major
build
block
for
the
development
of
future
component_9
over
the
year
the
role
of
technology_1
have
prove
central
to
connector_6
the
ever
increasing
complexity
of
quality_attribute_8
component_8
that
can
be
transform
in
a
quality_attribute_2
way
recent
development
in
connector_data_3
component_8
have
be
a
drive
factor
for
the
component_1
infrastructure
technology_1
requirement_1
this
be
the
connector_data_4
of
adoption
of
connector_data_3
component_8
in

component_1
requirement_7
eai
which
provide
the
ability
to
merge
many
component_4
run
in
an
requirement_8
through
an
pattern_3

it
can
combine
all
component_1
their
component_7

requirement_8

a
they
provide

moreover
a

have
be

the

however
a
major
challenge
face
by
the
component_1
infrastructure
technology_1
requirement_1
be
commoditization
of

base
around
technology_1
quality_attribute_10
