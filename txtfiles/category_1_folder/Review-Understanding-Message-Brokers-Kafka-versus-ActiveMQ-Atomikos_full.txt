this
be
our
review
of
the
ebook
understand
connector_data_1
pattern_1
publish
by
o
reilly
it
s
a
bias
review
because
we
approach
pattern_5
from
the
perspective
of
pattern_6
exactly
once
delivery
but
if
you
re
interest
in
exactly
once
delivery
then
this
be
probably
a
must
connector_1
introduction

our
take
without
technology_1
with
technology_1
next
step
reference
introduction
the
author
of
the
ebook
have
lot
of
past
expertise
with
technology_2
and
technology_9
and
recently
start
work
on
the
technology_1
project
the
ebook
give
his
perspective
on
both
these
connector_data_1
pattern_1
by
discus
each
one
in
turn
technology_2
a
the
author
explain
a
lot
of
the
technology_2
architecture
be
dictate
by
the
technology_4
specification
the
power
of
the
technology_4
specification
be
a
technology_10
way
of
interfacing
with
connector_data_1
pattern_1
and
for
this
reason
technology_4
have
be
nominate
a
one
of
the
best
technology_11
requirement_4
apis
a
big
part
of
technology_4
be
concern
about
quality_attribute_4
persistent
pattern_5
without
put
too
much
burden
on
the
pattern_5
component_2
for
instance
it
be
the
connector_data_1
pattern_1
s
responsibility
to
keep
connector_data_3
until
the
component_3
have
component_1
them
this
make
the
pattern_1
a
bit
more
complex
and
at
least
for
technology_7
this
make
requirement_2
degrade
a
the
number
of
component_3
go
up
consequently
technology_4
connector_data_1
pattern_1
technology_2
be
le
suit
for
the
universal
connector_data_2
pipeline
pattern_4
in
fact
it
s
consider
an
anti
pattern_4
for
the
technology_4
pattern_1
architecture
and
because
the
pattern_1
keep
connector_data_3
for
the
component_4
too
many
component_3
that
go
offline
can
connector_2
a
bit
more
disk
space
if
this
make
you
think
technology_1
u
le
disk
space
connector_1
on
note
that
many
technology_4
pattern_1
allow
set
a
connector_data_1
lifetime
after
which
unconsumed
connector_data_3
can
be
discard
so
in
practice
the
problem
not
be
a
big
a
you
might
expect
technology_1
the
design
goal
of
technology_1
be
reportedly
to
enable
the
universal
connector_data_2
pipeline
at
linkedin
this
require
a
different
pattern_1
because
it
s
an
anti
pattern_4
in
technology_4
for
the
reason
explain
above
so
where
technology_4
and
technology_2
be
tune
for
quality_attribute_4
persistent
pattern_5
and
therefore
can
t
support
connector_data_2
pipeline
very
well
technology_1
s
design
focus
on
exactly
these
connector_data_2
pipeline
it
do
offer
persistence
but
it
s
not
a
guarantee
a
with
technology_8
base
pattern_1
to
achieve
it
goal
technology_1
u
a
unify
destination
component_5
connector_3
topic
something
in
between
the
notion
of
a
technology_4
topic
and
a
technology_4
component_6
connector_data_3
be
keep
for
a
while
and
can
be
connector_2
more
than
once
via
resettable
pointer
if
desire
however
connector_data_1
persistence
be
limit
in
time
and
it
be
the
component_4
s
responsibility
to
connector_2
relevant
connector_data_3
before
the
pattern_1
delete
them
so
connector_data_3
can
be
lose
in
addition
to
be
connector_4
more
than
once
overall
the
design
of
the
technology_1
pattern_1
increase
disk
usage
by
a
much
a
time
what
technology_2
or
technology_4
pattern_1
need
without
any
guarantee
for
component_3
that
fail
to
pick
up
their
connector_data_3
before
the
pattern_1
decide
to
delete
them
however
it
s
really
fast
and
can
handle
up
to
million
of
connector_data_3
per
second
author
s
note
i
find
several
discussion
suggest
that
persistence
be
not
guarantee
in
technology_1
because
it
do
not
immediately
flush
to
disk
if
this
be
true
then
there
be
actually
no
persistence
guarantee
at
all
only
best
effort
this
probably
explain
why
it
can
be
very
fast
at
the
cost
of
possible
connector_data_1
loss
conclusion
our
take
whereas
the
book
claim
that
exactly
once
delivery
do
not
exist
we
have
show
how
easy
it
be
in
this
that
be
it
s
easy
if
you
use
technology_8
xa
capable
pattern_1
technology_7
in
the
requirement_5
of
technology_1
it
s
quite
different
because
technology_1
delegate
the
burden
of
exactly
once
to
the
connector_data_1
component_4
you
re
bind
to
encounter
the
pitfall
of
the
idempotent
component_4
connector_data_1
loss
be
also
possible
needle
to
say
xa
be
not
support
by
technology_1
we
recommend
use
technology_1
for
high
requirement_2
pattern_7
use
requirement_5
where
connector_data_1
loss
be
not
important
such
a
diagnostic
requirement_3
requirement_2
metric
or
other
statistical
type
but
if
you
care
about
exactly
once
delivery
if
your
connector_data_3
be
valuable
or
if
you
t
need
a
universal
connector_data_2
pipeline
then
it
s
best
to
stick
to
a
classical
pattern_1
technology_7
without
technology_1
without
technology_1
you
benefit
from
the
infrastructure
component_7
offer
by
your
technology_12
and
or
connector_data_1
pattern_1
for
regular
component_8
this
be
probably
what
you
want
with
technology_1
with
technology_1
you
only
have
requirement_3
mean
you
have
to
do
everything
else
yourself
in
your
if
you
re
linkedin
or
any
other
internet
giant
then
this
be
acceptable
to
you
alternatively
if
manage
requirement_3
be
your
thing
then
this
be
what
you
want
in
all
other
requirement_5
you
want
to
stick
to
what
be
out
there
already…
