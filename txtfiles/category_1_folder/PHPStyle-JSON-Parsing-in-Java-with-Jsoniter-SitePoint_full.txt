summary

technology_2
originate
from
a
weakly
type
and
dynamic
technology_7
technology_8
there
be
an
impedance
mismatch
between
json‚Äôs
dynamic
nature
and
java‚Äôs
rigid
type
i
find
exist
solution
too
focus
on
the
concept
of
connector_data_1
bind
which
be
too
heavy
weight
in
some
circumstance
contrast
that
with
technology_1
where
technology_1
we
have
the
all
in
one
connector_data_1
type

and
by
one
line
of
json_decode
we
can
requirement_1
a
complex
technology_2
document
jsoniter
be
a
technology_9
connector_2
in
technology_3
determine
to
make
technology_2
requirement_1
in
technology_3
a
easy
a
in
technology_1
through
a
similar
connector_data_1
type
any
the
most
remarkable
feature
be
the
underlie
lazy
requirement_1
technique
which
make
the
requirement_1
not
only
easy
but
very
fast
why
technology_2
be
hard
to
component_2
in
technology_3
there
be
three
reason
why
technology_2
document
can
be
hard
to
component_2
use
exist
requirement_5
i
connector_data_2
this
the
‚Äújson
impedance
mismatch‚Äù
reason

type
mismatch
when
technology_2
be
use
a
a
connector_data_1
exchange
technology_10
between
technology_3
and
dynamic
technology_7
technology_1
the
connector_data_3
type
might
become
a
problem
for
example
have
a
look
at
this
technology_11
{
order_id

order_details
{
pay_type
cash
}
}
99%
of
the
time
the
technology_1
might
the
exact
connector_data_4
we
expect
but
it
might
also
slightly
different
technology_2
for
different
input
condition
due
to
the
fact
most
technology_1
developer
do
not
care
if
a
variable
be
or

{
order_id

order_details
}
why
be
order_details
an
empty
instead
of
an
empty
connector_data_3
it
be
a
common
problem
when
work
with
technology_1
where
everything
be
an

an
use
a
a
non
empty
connector_data_5
will
be
encode
{
key
requirement_4
}
but
an
empty
connector_data_5
be
an
empty

which
will
be
encode
a
instead
of
{}
it
be
not
a
big
problem
definitely
fixable
but
for
historical
connector_data_1
requirement_6
we
have
to
deal
with
it
anyway
reason

heterogeneous
connector_data_1
in
jave
we
be
use
to
homogeneous
connector_data_1
for
example



be
an




a

but
how
do
you
represent



in
technology_3
an
connector_data_3
connector_data_3
be
awkward
to
work
with
how
about



technology_3
do
not
have
a
convenient
container
to
hold
this
kind
of
connector_data_1
moreover
it
be
very
common
in
technology_2
to
have
slightly
different
connector_data_6
represent
the
same
thing
for
example
a
success
connector_3
{


connector_data_1
success
}
but
for
an
error
connector_3
{


error
{
msg
wrong
parameter
stacktrace
‚Ä¶
}
}
if
we
want
to
connector_4
the
connector_data_1
or
error
connector_data_7
we
have
make
a
number
of
connector_5
assume
the
connector_3
be
represent
a
connector_data_5

connector_data_3
the
to
extract
the
error
connector_data_7
will
look
a
follow
connector_data_3
errorobj
=
connector_3
connector_4
error
if
errorobj
==

n
a
connector_data_5

connector_data_3
error

connector_data_5

connector_data_3
errorobj
connector_data_3
msgobj
=
errorobj
connector_4
msg
if
msgobj
==

n
a

msgobj
the
type
cast
and
connector_6
be
not
fun
at
all
unfortunately
it
be
common
to
extract
requirement_4
from
a
technology_2
five
level
deep
reason

requirement_3
and
quality_attribute_1
balance
by
go
with
technology_11
we
have
already
chosen
quality_attribute_1
instead
of
raw
requirement_3
however
it
still
feel
bad
to
requirement_1
a
technology_2
document
a
connector_data_5

connector_data_3

that
it
will
be
very
costly
i
be
not
argue
we
should
choose
the
requirement_3
over
expressiveness
but
the
guilt
of
deliberately
compromise
requirement_3
constantly
trouble
me
it
be
a
dilemma
i
find
myself
in
frequently
requirement_1
the
technology_2
a
connector_data_5

connector_data_3
and
connector_7
requirement_4
from
it
connector_8
the
trouble
of
define
a
schema
but
we
have
to
unmarshall
all
the
byte
regardless
if
we
need
them
or
not
define
a
and
use
connector_data_1
bind
it
can
skip
unneeded
requirement_1
work
and
connector_9
an
connector_data_3
be
fast
than
a
hash
connector_data_5
but
be
it
worth
the
trouble
every
time
some
technology_2
requirement_5
come
with
a
connector_10
technology_12
but
it
be
consider
too
low
level
there
be
a
long
way
between
totally
type
le
requirement_1
and
rigid
connector_data_1
bind
it
would
be
quality_attribute_2
if
we
have
more
option
to
choose
between
requirement_3
and
quality_attribute_1
or
both
how

to

let‚Äôs
install
it

the

you

where
the

a

which
par
the

with

component_3
to
iterate

a
for

which
be
best
for

large

and
you
will
not

force
to

all
the
time
use

for

and
combine

for

now
i

go
to
show
you
how
to
easily
deal
with

use
these
three
apis
connector_data_1

jsoniter
do
not

to
use

for

requirement_7
connector_data_1
bind
be
still
the
most
comfortable
technology_12
quality_attribute_4
let‚Äôs
bind
this
quality_attribute_4
example
{
order_id

order_details
{
pay_type
cash
}
}
for
that
we
will
design
a
this
order
{
long
order_id
orderdetails
order_details
}
orderdetails
{
pay_type
}
to
deserialize
the
technology_2
input
we
will
use
jsoniterator
order
order
=
jsoniterator
deserialize
input
order

the
input
can
be
or
byte
if
you
need
to
use
an
inputstream
a
input
it
will
be
a
little
bit
more
verbose
jsoniterator
iter
=
jsoniterator
requirement_1
input
order
order
=
iter
connector_7
order

you
can
close
the
underlie
inputstream
via
iter
or
directly
it
do
not
have
it
own
resource
to
dispose
iter
close
a
requirement_7
for
annotation
everybody

how
quality_attribute_4
bind
work
but
what
about
messy
input
{
order_id

order_details
}
we
will
need
annotation
support
in
this
requirement_7
first
we
enable
this
optional
feature
through
jsoniterannotationsupport
enable
this
only
need
to
be
do
once
you
can
put
it
in
the
or
initializer
now
annotation
to
the
order
order
{
@jsonproperty
decoder
=
maybestringlongdecoder

long
order_id
@jsonproperty
decoder
=
maybeemptyarraydecoder

orderdetails
order_details
}
by
use
the
maybe
decoder
we
can
make
the
bind
fuzzy
about
connector_data_1
type
in
some
requirement_7
if
the
connector_data_4
itself
be
‚Äúdynamic‚Äù
we‚Äôd
quality_attribute_2
use
any
instead
any
connector_data_1
type
instead
of
define
a
describe
the
connector_data_1
schema
we
can
use
the
any
connector_data_1
type
it
be
pretty
much
a
replacement
for
connector_data_5

connector_data_3
or
connector_data_9
connector_data_3
let‚Äôs
connector_7
the
same
technology_2
a
before
{
order_id

order_details
{

}
this
be
the
to
do
that
any
order
=
jsoniterator
connector_7
input
paytype
=
order
tostring
order_details
pay_type
the
tostring
might
look
weird
so
me
explain
connector_4
order_details
then
connector_4
pay_type
from
the
order_details
then
convert
the
requirement_4
of
pay_type
from
whatever
type
to
a
even
in
the
follow
requirement_7
the
still
work
because
it
convert

to

{
order_details
{
pay_type
5}
}
what
if
the
input
be
not
what
we
expect
for
example
{
order_details
}
the
tostring
order_tails
pay_type
will
not
throw
a
nullpointerexception
instead
it
will
the
empty

most
of
the
time
the
empty
be
what
we
expect
it
be
worth
mention
that
the
requirement_1
be
do
lazily
for
those
part
you
do
not
connector_7
from
they
will
be
keep
in

connector_12
the
