pattern_1
in
a
pattern_2
worldok
so
you
drink
the
pattern_2
kool
aid
and
that’s
everything
you
intend
to
do
from
now
on
by
the
time
you
connector_2
your
second
component_1
or
even
quality_attribute_1
refactor
an
exist
one
into
two
small
piece
you
have
to
think
of
connector_1
between
msa

at
first
thing
be
quality_attribute_2
enough
so
you
pick
a
weapon
of
choice
say
rest
and
use
it
then
again
and
yet
another
time
and
before
you
it
you
have
connector_2
a
chatty
reflective
and
frail
set
of

hardcore
fan
of
a
give
connector_1
component_2
be
probably
already
shout
in
their
head
i
hope
seriously
people
stop
it
“this
be
a
perfect
requirement_1
for
rest

component_3
actor
unicorn
base
connector_data_1
”
when
in
reality
it
usually
isn’t
these
approach
either
preconize
a
very
specific
way
of
set
up
or
be
broad
enough
that
different
inconsistent
pattern_1
arise
if
no
care
be
give
and
that
violate
an
important
rule
of
thumb
while
pattern_3
allow
easy
disposal
of

they
require
careful
consideration
of
cross
cut
technology_1
so
let’s
break
that
statement
into
chunk
and
justify
it
shall
we
easy
disposal
of

if
each
component_1
be
sufficiently
a
small
and
b
isolate
they
should
be
cheap
and
fast
to
create
and
maintain
this
allow
a
fast
pace
delivery
of
feature
while
keep
potential
technical
doubt
under
control
they
require
careful
consideration
of
cross
cut
technology_1
pattern_3
be
no
silver
bullet
against
complexity
connector_3
it
outside
of
component_1
boundary
where
do
it
go
then
to
the
connector_4
between
these

connector_data_2
to
connector_2
something
akin
to
quality_attribute_3
pattern_4
behavior
across
component_4
or
simply
perform
connector_data_3
over
diverse
syntax
eg
connector_data_4
url
connector_5
technology_2
verb
can
easily
become
nightmarish
if
team
do
not
reach
a
consensus
in
term
of
technology_3
yeah
that
ugly
word
commandsa
command
happen
when
a
component_5
component_6
need
an
action
to
be
perform
by
a
give
component_1
technology_4
the
component_5
also
need
a
connector_6
in
either
a
pattern_5
or
pattern_6
way
inform
about
the
connector_data_5
the
core
thing
to
keep
in
mind
be
this
promote
some
couple
a
component_5
and
potentially
technology_4
be
make
aware
of
one
another
couple
become
tight
in
requirement_1
the
component_5
need
a
connector_6
a
this
mean
it
will
need
to
a
wait
and
b
handle
all
possible
outcome
of
the
include
unavailability
couple
become
tight
in
requirement_1
of
pattern_7
connector_data_6
since
the
technology_4
need
to
component_7
the
connector_data_7
at
the
time
it
be
make
for
an
in
between
solution
a
common
pattern_1
be
to
provide
a
quality_attribute_2
“accepted”
answer
synchronously
and
do
the
heavy
lift
in
an
pattern_6
fashion
time
bind
increase
connector_4
complexity
if
a
component_5
issue
a
command
and
need
an
answer
in
up
to
a
minute
what
should
it
do
after
the
timeout
what
should
it
do
if
the
technology_4
still
component_7
the
connector_data_7
after
say

minute
a
cousin
to
the
this
pattern_1
be
the
query
while
a
different
beast
in
nature
it
shouldn’t
be
connector_data_8
alter
for
example
and
potentially
something
that
can
be
connector_2
in
a
radically
different
way
see
cqrs
which
btw
propose
similar
concept
the
bullet
point
above
be
still
valid
for
such

a
part
of
the
popularity
of
command
be
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
be
very
easy
—
no
wonder
most
of
u
be
introduce
to
programming
by
rely
exclusively
on
it
yeah
helloworld
i
be
talk
about
you
have
say
all
that
this
pattern_1
be
frequently
unavoidable
you
will
need
an
answer
from
the
credit
card
component_1
in
your
e
commerce
before
you
move
connector_7
in
the
order
component_7
no
matter
how
much
you
would
to
avoid
it
eventsan
refer
to
an
occurrence
in
the
past
that
quality_attribute_2
statement
carry
a
number
of
consequence

be
immutable
you
can’t
say
“nonono
that
order
wasn’t
submit
i
won’t
have
that
”
it’s
a
do
deal
there’s
nothing
you
can
connector_8
about
it
you
can
at
most
technology_5
to
it
the
emitter
can
be
completely
oblivious
of
the
component_8
publish
it
somewhere
and
component_9
technology_5
to
it
a
they
see
fit
the
component_8
also
be
oblivious
of
the
emitter
—
in
requirement_1
the
connector_data_9
flow
through
a
connector_9
pattern_8
eg
a
connector_data_1
component_10
this
be
the
only
connector_10
they
need
the
overall
component_7
be
pattern_6
by
nature
therefore
this
pattern_1
allow
fairly
decouple
connector_1
the
emitter
be
say
“look
buddy
this
be
what
happen
do
what
you
will”
if
well
connector_2
the
technology_4
do
not
even
who
be
the
component_11
listen
to
that
—
it
simply
doesn’t
care
think
of
it
a
a
news
outlet
pattern_9
to
a
large
audience
be
fairly
the
same
component_7
no
matter
the
audience
size
this
pattern_1
have
be
around
for
age
especially
in
ui
focus
technology_6
old
time
technology_7
such
a
technology_8
have
a
a
first

citizen
and

trendy
libs
such
a
redux
be
design
around
pattern_10
flow
in
the
big
architecture
world
buzzword
such
a
pattern_11
architecture
component_3
and
others
revolve
around
this
concept
in
requirement_1
this
be
start
to
sound
a
sale
pitch
please
beware
that
it’s
not
all
flower
in
the
world
due
to
it
pattern_6
nature
developer
have
to
worry
about
correlation
you
ask
for
something
eg
create
an
order
for
me
and
thing
start
happen
eg
pick
pack
invoice
in
parallel
to
other
people’s
connector_data_7
to
find
the
you
care
about
you
need
a
track
number
of
sort
so
you
can
tie
thing
together
connector_2
something
similar
to
a
quality_attribute_3
transaction
become
a
major
challenge
a
each
be
a
independent
and
b
immutable
hence
you
cannot
roll
it
back
there
be
no
quality_attribute_2
answer
to
that
and
possible
approach
include
requirement_2
component_7
connector_8
compensate
and
eventual
consistency
and
quite
commonly
a
mix
of
them
since
component_7
be
so
quality_attribute_3
component_4
that
be
sensitive
to
order
have
a
major
hard
time
cop
with
all
the
inherent
non
determinism
of
when
they
connector_11
connector_data_1
there
be
component_4
out
there
such
a
technology_9
that
allow
some
order
support
but
quite
frequently
any
order
bind
component_12
need
some
level
of
revision
in
a
web
world
technology_1
for
this
pattern_1
be
not
a
close
to
consensus
a
for
command
aka
rest
but
in
requirement_1
the
component_13
be
publish

how
can
they
be
make
easily
quality_attribute_4
for
component_14
web
connector_data_10
sse
pattern_12
yuck
web
hook
the
fact
that
so
many
exist
show
that
none
can
be
claim
king
of
the
hill
all
the
point
above
consider
while
this
approach
quality_attribute_5
and
extend
quality_attribute_1
over
time
it
usually
present
a
high
ticket
to
entry
lead
team
to
defer
a
connector_12
towards
until
it’s
require
or
unfortunately
even
late
in
a
nutshelluse
command
if
the
component_1
component_5
need
the
connector_6
in
order
to
move
further
with
it
component_7
the
need
to
be
pattern_7
the
connector_data_6
be
a
quality_attribute_2
query
long
run
one
require
schedule
consider
use
this
approach
if
you
be
connector_13
start
a
it
tend
to
be
quality_attribute_2
at
first
use
if
it
be
a
commonly
seek
after
connector_data_1
eg
an
order
have
be
invoice
mean
a
single
connector_data_1
be
connector_14
by
multiple
component_5
the
component_15
of
the
connector_data_11
do
not
care
about
extra
component_7
do
by
whoever
be
connector_15
it
—
those
extraneous
should
have
no
impact
on
the
original
connector_data_5
consider
introduce
this
a
your
architecture
grow
a
a
pure
command
pattern_1
do
not
quality_attribute_5
well
over
a
large
problem
set
further
readingnone
of
the
concept
above
be
radically
and
can
be
find
in
seminal
text
on
topic
such
a

drive
architecture
propose
a
a
centerpiece
kind
of
connector_data_1
for
decouple
connector_1
between
different
component_6

component_3
go
one
step
further
and
suggest
that
component_16
state
emanate
from

allow
a
a
clear
separation
of
both
each
kind
of
connector_data_8
can
be
component_17
with
different
strategy
and
b
the
composition
of
into
multiple
consolidate
vision
financial
and
fulfillment
aggregation
on
order
connector_data_8
cqrs
us
the
difference
between
command
and
to
propose
component_18
in
which
connector_16
and
connector_14
be
asymmetric
to
one
another
so
it
be
a
great
match
with
component_3
reactive
programming
in
many
of
it
flavor
us
a
a
core
concept
