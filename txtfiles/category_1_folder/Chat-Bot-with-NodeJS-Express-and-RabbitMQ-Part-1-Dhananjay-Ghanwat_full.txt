2018this
be
the
first
part
of
build
a
quality_attribute_1
quality_attribute_2
and
drive
requirement_2
component_1
use
technology_1
j
express
and
technology_2
the
component_2
will
connector_2
the
below
design
where
we
connector_3
a
chat
requirement_1
pattern_1
which
will
connector_4
the
connector_data_1
to
a
technology_2
component_3
and
answer
the
user’s
query
use
our
requirement_1
develop
use
chatterbotdetails
of
chatterbot
be
outside
the
scope
of
this
connector_5
up
but
you
can
have
a
look
at
it
at
their
to
more
it
a
quality_attribute_3
example
of
how
we
can
combine
technology_3
world
which
be
of
type
connector_data_1
connector_6
with
drive
world
which
be
of
the
type
fire
and
forget
world
it
not
very
often
that
we
need
this
requirement_3
but
there
could
be
some
use
requirement_4
the
one
we
be
build
or
to
be
more
general
any
use
requirement_4
where
you
have
a
long
run
component_4
but
still
need
to
connector_6
the
component_5
it
shouldn’t
be
a
long
series
let’s
see
what
we
can
build
in
this
part
we
will
start
with
express
part
and
requirement_3
with
technology_2
let’s
connector_7
our
environment
work
first
we’ll
need
to
install
the
technology_4
that
we’ll
use
create
a
dir
and
initialize
the
nodejs
component_2
inside
it
npm
init
and
then
let’s
install
the
deps
npm
install
connector_8
express
technology_3
body
requirement_5
technology_3
error

requirement_5
normalize
port
rabbot
now
let’s
connector_5
the
entry
point
for
our
component_1
we’ll
have
one
entry
point
the
path
chat
that
will
handle
the
connector_data_1
and
produce
a
connector_data_2
for
our
technology_2

work
great
now

try
to
quality_attribute_4
with

for
that
first
we
need
to
define
some
configuration
for
technology_2
create
a

create
some
technology_2
configuration
create

export

the
above
be

which
basically
define

and
then
bind
