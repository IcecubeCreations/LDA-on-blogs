pattern_1
join
the
and
connector_2
the
full
member
experience
join
for
free
a
you
i
m
open
component_2
and
completely
overhaul
my
phd
component_3
one
of
my
goal
be
to
replace
internal
technology_1
component_4
with
technology_2
today
i
ll
show
you
how
i
do
it
and
why
i
be
force
to
connector_3
technology_3
to
technology_5
technology_7
technology_9
in
short
technology_9
be
an
open
technology_10
component_5
pattern_3
technology_11
for
connector_data_1
orient
technology_12
the
most
important
feature
be
that
technology_9
be
a
wire
level
technology_11
and
be
quality_attribute_2
by
design
technology_1
be
an
technology_13
altough
technology_1
pattern_4
can
be
use
in
technology_14
component_6
see
my

technology_15
and
technology_14
combine
the
whole
technology_1
specification
do
not
guarantee
quality_attribute_3
also
the
technology_9
technology_10
be
by
design
more
quality_attribute_4
and
powerful
e
g
support
two
way
connector_4
by
design
they
simply

from
technology_1
mistake
oh
forget
to
mention
the
technology_9
be
originally
develop
by
bank
so
i

t
have
to
say
that
technology_9
be
quality_attribute_5
fault
tolerant
and
so
on
technology_3
technology_3
be
the
most
mature
technology_9
pattern_4
technology_3
be
connector_5
in
technology_16
so
you
have
to
download
that
first
technology_3
window
installer
do
it
for
you
download
it
from
here
technology_17
www
technology_3
technology_18
i
also
recommend
instal
the
web
requirement_7
console
from
rabbit
s
sbin
directory
connector_6
technology_3
plugins
enable
rabbitmq_management
if
you
re
on
window
and
you
instal
a
rabbit
component_7
you
have
to
restart
it
that
s
it
technology_4
well
it
turn
out
that
vmware
buy
technology_3
and
springsource
developer
be
now
develop
it
give
this
fact
you
shouldn
t
be
surprise
that
technology_4
technology_3
requirement_1
be
childishly
quality_attribute_6
technology_4
rabbit
connector_7
to
your
technology_19
project
and
then
in
technology_4
configuration
paste
the
follow
rabbit
connector_8
factory
id=
connectionfactory
rabbit
template
connector_8
factory=
connectionfactory
id=
amqptemplate
connector_9
key=
myqueue
rabbit
admin
connector_8
factory=
connectionfactory
rabbit
component_8
name=
myqueue
the
default
configuration
assume
that
technology_3
be
run
on
a
local
component_9
use
the
default
port
and
default
credential
guest
guest
of
all
these
setting
be
quality_attribute_7
to
connector_10
a
connector_data_1
to
myqueue
component_8
inject
an
instance
of
amqptemplate
into
your
component_7
and
connector_11
the
connector_data_1
an
example
would
be
@service
homecontroller
{
@autowired
private
amqptemplate
amqptemplate
sendmessage
bundle
bundle
throw
ioexception
{
byte
body
=
ioutils
tobytearray
bundle
getinputstream
messageproperties
messageproperties
=

messageproperties
setcontenttype
bundle
getcontenttype
messageproperties
setcontentlength
bundle
getsize
messageproperties
settimestamp

date
messageproperties
setdeliverymode
messagedeliverymode
persistent
connector_data_1
connector_data_1
=
connector_data_1
body
messageproperties
amqptemplate
connector_11
connector_data_1
}
}you
can
open
the
web
console
technology_17
localhost

mgmt
and
see

connector_data_1
in
myqueue
component_8
technology_5
technology_6
to
connector_12
a
connector_data_1
from
technology_5
technology_6
you
first
have
to
technology_6
technology_2
connector_7
to
your
pom
then
copy
and
paste
the
follow
connector_13
definition
camelcontext
xmlns=
technology_17
technology_6
technology_5

schema
technology_4
connector_13
from
uri=
technology_2
component_8
myqueue
to
uri=
requirement_2
connector_data_1
connector_13
camelcontext
run
the
connector_13
by
connector_6
mvn
technology_6
run
and
you
ll
see
an
error
make
a
long
story
short
technology_5
technology_6



doesn
t
work
with
technology_3
this
be
because
the
technology_6
technology_2
component_10
be
use
the
technology_5
technology_7
component_11
under
the
hood
the
current
technology_7
version
be


but
technology_7
guy
forget
to
connector_14
jar
to
the
technology_19
repo
thus
technology_6
technology_2
be
still
use
technology_7


whose
component_11
doesn
t
seem
to
negotiate
technology_11
even
if
you
exclude
technology_7
common
and
technology_7
component_11
connector_7
and
explicitly
technology_7


one
download
them
and
install
in
your
local
repo
there
will
be
an
exception
throw
from
the
technology_6
technology_2
component_10
a
there
be
no
long
a
default
connectionfactory
constructor
thus
i
be
force
to
install
technology_7
technology_7
i
download
the
technology_8
component_9
and
simply
run
it
there
be
no
web
requirement_7
console
but
that
s
ok
you
can
use
jconsole
for
technology_20
technology_4
technology_9
and
technology_7
in
order
to
make
technology_4
technology_9
work
with
technology_7
copy
and
paste
the
follow
configuration
camelcontext
xmlns=
technology_17
technology_6
technology_5

schema
technology_4
connector_13
from

a
you
can
see
in
the
above
snippet
i
explicitly
create
ampqcomponent
with
connectionfactory
set
to

technology_7
amqconnectionfactory
connector_data_2

and
work
example
this
solution
be
a
part
of
the
qualitas

i
use

bundle

component_15
and

it
to

then
technology_5
technology_6
connector_15
the
connector_data_1
do
additional

and
install
it
