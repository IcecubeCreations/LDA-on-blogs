what
be
the
difference
between
technology_3
technology_1
and
technology_2
what
be
the

technology_2

kafka’s
be
a
quality_attribute_1
pattern_2
pattern_3
component_2
most
of
the
development
effort
be
involve
with
allow
pattern_4
to
connector_1
exactly
the
connector_data_2
they
be
interest
in

technology_2
be
be
a
connector_2
component_2
i
e
technology_2
provide
back
pressure
to
prevent
overflow
component_3
by
persistently
connector_3
the
incoming
connector_data_2
until
they
expire
so
that
late
component_4
can
pick
the
connector_data_2
up
at
their
own
pace

technology_2
will
component_5
the
connector_data_3
for
some
day
or
week
or
traffic
that
would
be
able
to
be
reprocess
any
number
of
time
by
any
number
of
component_3
group
but
most
importantly
the
create
rate
of
those
will
not
overload
the
component_6
or
the
component_7
try
to
connector_4
connector_data_3
into
component_6

it
can
be
use
for
any
component_2
to
connector_5
to
other
component_8
that
require
requirement_2
level
pattern_3

activity
track
operational
metric
connector_6
component_9
etc
it’s
a
general
purpose
publish
subscribe
or
component_10
component_2
and
can
mesh
with
any
component_11
or
component_3

technology_2
be
very
quality_attribute_2
one
of
the
key
benefit
of
technology_2
be
that
it
be
very
easy
to
large
number
of
component_4
without
affect
requirement_3
and
without
down
time

high
quality_attribute_3
of
quality_attribute_4
in
requirement_4
of
failure
technology_1

technology_1
have
be
develop
to
ingest
connector_data_3
into
technology_4
it
be
tightly
quality_attribute_5
with
hadoop’s
pattern_5
component_2
component_2
technology_5
and
utility
mostly
technology_1
development
be
to
make
it
quality_attribute_6
with
technology_4

technology_1
be
a
connector_7
component_2
which
imply
connector_data_3
loss
when
component_4
can’t
keep
up
build
around
technology_4
ecosystem
for
the
primary
purpose
of
connector_8
connector_data_2
to
technology_6
&
technology_7

technology_1
be
not
a
quality_attribute_2
a
technology_2
a

more
component_4
to
technology_1
mean
connector_9
the
topology
of
technology_1
pipeline
design
replicate
the
pattern_6
to
connector_10
the
connector_data_2
to
a
connector_11
it
be
not
really
a
quality_attribute_2
solution
when
you
have
a
huge
number
of
component_3
also
since
the
technology_8
topology
need
to
be
connector_9
it
require
some
down
time

technology_1
do
not
replicate
–
in
requirement_4
of
technology_8
agent
failure
you
will
lose
in
the
pattern_6
when
to
use

technology_8
when
work
with
non
relational
connector_data_3
component_12
such
a
requirement_1
which
be
to
be
connector_6
into
technology_4
technology_2
when
in
need
of
highly
quality_attribute_7
and
quality_attribute_2
requirement_2
pattern_3
component_2
to
connector_5
many
multiple
component_8
include
technology_4

technology_2
for
technology_4
technology_2
be
a
pipeline
that
connector_12
connector_data_3
in
real
time
and
connector_7
to
technology_4
technology_4
component_7
it
inside
and
then
a
per
the
requirement
either
serve
to
other
component_4
requirement_5
pattern_7
etc
or
connector_13
it
for
further
