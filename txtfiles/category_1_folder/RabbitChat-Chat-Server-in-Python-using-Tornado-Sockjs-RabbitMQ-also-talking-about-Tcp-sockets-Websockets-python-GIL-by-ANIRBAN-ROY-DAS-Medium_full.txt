if
you
be
not
convinced
then
i
be
go
to
coin
some
name
and
try
to
lure
you
into
believe
me
anyway
have
you
hear
of
whatsapp
snapchat
messenger
wechat
they
be
giant
that
be
rule
the
world
presently
they
be
the
king
of
startup
and
every
other
guy
who
want
to
start
their
own
startup
be
probably
dream
weave
these
giant’s

m
personal

image
sourcestill
no
have
you
hear
of
this
sudden
phenomenon
that
start
with
this
one
requirement_1
connector_1
magic
the
one
stop
pattern_1
component_2
which
create
a
wave
of
many
similar
requirement_1
with
the
idea
of
a
personal
assistant
component_2
yes
this
idea
have
take
the
world
be
in
india
we
for
certain
that
there
be
close
to

requirement_1
try
to
do
this
chat
be
their
asgard
their
holy
place
without
it
they
cannot
do
anything
their
whole
requirement_2
be
base
on
the
fundamental
of
chat
even
the
mighty
have
announce
it
candidacy
in
this
personal
assistant
component_2
runway
see
i
make
chat
and
instant
pattern_1
cool
for
you
i
make
it
important
for
you
now
you
definitely
need
to
connector_2
on
and
late
go
ahead
and
try
to
start
up
a
requirement_1
base
on
it
notei
generally
connector_3
my

with
a
certain
wit
and
try
to
connector_3
in
a
quality_attribute_1
word
a
possible
and
avoid
the
tech
jargon
to
be
on
the
light
side
though
i
intend
to
do
so
for
all
my

but
some
of
the
topic
would
deal
with
real
discussion
about
the
project
that
i
will
be
blogging
about
in
those

i
will
try
to
be
more
technical
about
stuff
and
talk
more
from
a
technical
perspective
with
example
and
diagram
image
sourceintroducing
rabbitchattoday’s
be
one
such
where
i
would
to
talk
about
this
project
that
i
recently
do
it
a
guess
what
chat
component_1
it
connector_3
in
technology_1
technology_5
cpython
it
us
technology_2
to
handle
the
requirement_3
and
web
connector_data_2
it
us
websockets
to
do
instant
pattern_1
use
the
sockjs
technology_6
technology_7
it
also
us
technology_3
a
a
connector_data_3
pattern_2
to
component_3
and
connector_4
connector_data_4
over
technology_8
technology_9
pika
be
an
technology_10
technology_1
component_4
technology_7
that
be
use
to
talk
to
technology_3
from
technology_1
that’s
a
gist
of
the
tech
spec
i
will
talk
about
each
of
them
in
detail
one
by
one
for
the
impatient
one
go
ahead
and
play
with
it
already
technology_11
connector_5
let’s
do
the
engineering
nowhere
be
a
diagram
of
what
i
draw
on
my
whiteboard
while
try
to
engineer
the
component_5
this
diagram
be
hazy
and
disgust
and
my
apology
for
not
come
up
with
anything
quality_attribute_2
but
i
always
the
concept
of
keep
it
raw
raw
mean
the
exact
brainstorming
that
go
through
an
idea
or
a
project
also
i
be
lazy
to
draw
diagram
in
some
word
processor
so
please
bear
with
me
i
will
try
to
come
up
with
more
professional
diagram
in
my
future

so
what
we
see
be
a
high
level
diagram
of
the
entrire
component_5
at
the
top
they
be
the
web
browser
or
the
web
component_4
b1
b2
b3
b4
etc
these
component_6
or
component_7
be
outside
of
the
dot
black
colour
circle
the
dot
circle
be
part
of
the
backend
the
component_1
side
now
in
the
backend
there
be
two
major
group
the
one
on
the
top
be
the
technology_2
component_1
the
web
connector_data_5
actually
hit
technology_2
itself
from
there
few
connector_data_5
technology_12
connector_data_2
auth
connector_data_2
etc
be
directly
respond
back
from
technology_2
itself
and
the
concern
instant
pattern_1
connector_data_5
be
first
connector_6
to
the
lower
component_8
and
the
lower
component_8
respond
with
some
connector_data_6
back
to
the
upper
component_8
i
e
the
technology_2
component_1
and
then
technology_2
connector_7
back
the
appropriate
connector_8
back
to
the
component_4
now

talk
a
little
more
about
the
lower
component_8
the
lower
component_8
be
our
technology_3
connector_data_3
pattern_2
now
we
will
talk
in
detail
about
each
part
and
try
to
understand
the
entire
workflow
and
also
see
some
example
torndaothis
be
not
the
technology_2
we
keep
hearing
about
in
the
news
it
a
technology_1
web
and
requirement_3
technology_7
develop
by
the
folk
at
friendfeed
which
now
doesn’t
exist
but
this
project
continue
to
grow
a
an
open_source
project
on
technology_13
technology_2
be
a
unicorn
in
the
technology_1
world
technology_2
be
technology_1
community’s
answer
to
the
nodejs
and
they
stand
proud
in
represent
technology_2
a
it
work
similar
to
technology_14
with
a
similar
single
component_9
loop
component_10
which
be
why
it
make
both
of
them
highly
concurrent
in
their
component_11
and
the
reason
for
the
buzz
only
difference
be
technology_2
be
a
technology_1
technology_7
that
mean
it
run
on
the
technology_1
vm
eg
the
cpython
vm
but
nodejs
itself
be
a
run
time
component_12
which
run
the
technology_15
technology_5
though
both
of
them
aren’t
actually
comparable
on
eye
to
eye
basis
but
nodejs
be
unique
because
nobody
can
explain
nodejs
to
you
directly
but
most
of
them
actually
compare
nodejs
with
a
technology_5
counterpart
technology_1
technology_16
technology_17
which
actually
be
funny
since
technology_15
be
the
technology_5
and
not
nodejs
but
hey
you
what
we
component_13
science
engineer
be
talk
about
technology_1
technology_5
be
a
very
humanly
technology_5
and
easy
to
understand
you
can
become
a
technology_1
pro
in
a
very
le
time
a
compare
to
other
technology_5
technology_17
sigh…
but
technology_1
have
it
drawback
since
it
try
to
make
everything
so
easy
to
work
with
in
the
front
but
it
do
it
at
the
expense
of
be
pretty
slow
in
computational
work
in
the
backend
it’s
requirement_4
comparison
with
other
statically
type
technology_5
technology_18
technology_19
technology_17
and
it
child
technology_20
technology_21
go
be
slow
by
many
many
time
since
technology_1
be
dynamically
type
make
work
easy
in
the
component_14
for
developer
but
it
have
to
deal
with
many
type
conversion
bad
memory
allocation
pattern_3
of
cod
before
it
actually
make
the
real
component_5
connector_data_7
or
technology_22
connector_data_7
for
cpython
it
also
have
the
deadly
gil
global
pattern_4
lock
which
be
although
present
in
a
few
other
technology_5
technology_16
but
it
widely
and
loudly
talk
about
in
technology_1
than
anywhere
else
to
give
you
some
perspective
on
gil
exist
or
not
in
other
technology_5
please
follow
these
connector_9
and
amaze
and
educate
yourself
be
gil
a
problem
in
nodejs
too
other
technology_5
that
have
gilnodejs
have
a
gil
nobody
talk
about
it
why
do
technology_23
component_12
have
a
gil
gilgil
be
what
make
technology_1
come
down
to
it
knee
gil
basically
hold
a
global
lock
at
the
pattern_4
the
technology_1
component_15
level
it
doesn’t
allow
more
than
one
component_9
to
run
simultaneously

see
what
this
actually
mean
it
mean
when
technology_1
be
run
and
component_15
something
it
be
use
cpu
cycle
and
the
technology_1
component_15
be
connector_10
some
in
a
component_9
now
gil
will
hold
a
lock
on
this
component_9
and
won’t
allow
any
other
component_9
to
run
while
this
component_9
be
run
now
suppose
the
component_9
or
the
component_15
create
another
component_9
to
run
part
of
the
in
the
component_9
but
unfortunately
if
the
first
component_9
be
still
run
then
the
component_9
will
not
be
able
to
run
at
all
even
if
the
component_5
you
be
run
on
have
multiple
cpu
core
this
be
the
gil
the
evil
gil
but
if
the
component_9
be
do
some
i
o
then
gil
be
release
and
other
component_16
can
run
also
if
the
component_9
be
make
any
technology_22
level
connector_data_8
the
gil
be
release
even
in
that
requirement_5
it
pretty
weird
right
but
it
what
it
be
the
reason
why
and
how
this
be
do
be
beyond
the
scope
of
this

be
sometime
in
the
future
now
if
technology_1
be
so
slow
and
it
also
have
the
evil
gil
how
come
people
still
in
technology_1
and
it
one
of
the
most
love
and
favour
technology_5
to
work
on
and
how
be
there
so
many
startup
who
prefer
work
on
technology_1
instead
of
technology_17
or
technology_19
etc
folk
the
thing
be
most
of
the
startup
or
the
project
that
we
see
now
a
day
be
web
base
and
all
of
them
require
some
sort
of
requirement_3
and
requirement_3
mean
more
of
i
o
and
le
of
cpu
bind
work
and
a
i
mention
technology_1
gil
be
release
while
do
i
o
thus
wait
or
pattern_5
for
i
o
in
technology_17
or
technology_18
technology_19
be
a
quality_attribute_2
a
wait
in
technology_1
then
why
not
wait
in
technology_1
and
use
it
humanly
and
easy
to
syntax
here
be
few
connector_9
which
will
really
connector_11
you
from
to
master
on
gil
and
python’s
component_16
and
component_15
inside
the
technology_1
gilpython’s
hard
problemimage
sourcewhy
torndao
why
not
technology_24
or
technology_25
guy
please
don’t
do
this
if
i
say
one
of
them
be
quality_attribute_2
than
the
other
there
will
be
connector_data_9
force
from
each
behind
me
but
me
give
you
some
perspective
and
i
will
try
to
explain
my
slight
bias
toward
one
with
much
humility
at
the
end
of
the
day
every
component_1
have
two
thing
one
be
a
number
of
raw
technology_4
technology_26
listen
on
some
port
at
an
ip
connector_12
two
a
technology_9
to
connector_13
with
the
component_4
technology_27
component_1
be
a
component_1
which
us
technology_27
technology_9
to
connector_13
with
the
component_4
and
it
listen
on
port

of
a
particular
connector_data_1
in
general
when
we
start
an
technology_27
component_1
we
be
actually
create
technology_4
connector_data_1
listen
on
port

at
a
particular
ip
connector_12
the
technology_27
component_1
listen
or
similar
command
be
a
sugar
for
the
entire
complex
connector_data_1
creation
connector_data_1
bind
and
listen
on
the
connector_data_1
component_15
technology_28
and
technology_25
be
web
technology_29
that
help
you
do
those
above
work
in
a
much
abstract
way
it
give
you
technology_27
component_1
and
also
a
technology_7
or
bunch
of
to
use
to
connector_14
listen
component_15
respond
to
technology_27
connector_data_2
quality_attribute_1
well
technology_2
almost
do
the
same
thing
the
difference
be
technology_2
be
a
single
component_9
and
evented
component_1
wait
wait
don’t
worry
i
be
here
to
explain
this
technology_28
and
technology_25
when
start
it
start
a
component_15
and
when
you
connector_15
connector_data_2
to
technology_24
or
technology_25
it
start
component_15
the
connector_data_2
but
it
not
single
component_9
if
the
component_15
be
run
and
block
on
something
the
further
connector_data_5
be
delay
until
the
component_15
currently
run
be

from
cpu
gil
be
release
technology_30
technology_31
all
these
be
technology_1
technology_32
component_17
which
help
run
technology_24
or
technology_25
component_18
in
a
production
environment
by
fork
multiple
component_15
and
each
individual
technology_27
connector_data_2
be
serve
by
each
of
these
component_15
but
in
technology_2
every
connector_data_2
be
serve
by
a
single
component_15
it
work
in
an
evented
component_10
where
each
connector_data_2
if
wait
on
i
o
wait
on
some
kind
of
pattern_6
mechanism
epoll
linux
or
kqueue
bsd
and
mac
o
x
if
they
be
quality_attribute_3
or
else
fall
back
on
select
this
allow
large
pattern_7
to
more
here
be
few
connector_5
they
be
real
quality_attribute_2
connector_2
what
the
heck
be
the
loop
this
be
more
for
technology_33
and
technology_34
component_19
but
it
give
a
fantastic
introduction
to
loop
in
general
a
must
watch
actually
the
future
of
pattern_8
i
o
in
pythonunderstanding
technology_1
concurrencya
curious
on
coroutines

concurrencytornado
and
geventrabbitmq
technology_8
and
pikaamqp
be
a
technology_9
use
to
do
instant
connector_data_3
it
lightweight
and
fast
and
it
quality_attribute_4
make
for
connector_data_3
connector_16
technology_3
be

connector_data_3
technology_3
talk
use
the
technology_8
technology_9
so
any
component_4
which
want
to
connector_13
with
technology_3
should
be
talk
use
the
technology_8
technology_9
pika
be
a
component_4
technology_7
use
to
talk
with
technology_3
use
the
technology_8
technology_9
technology_6
and
sockjswebsocket
be
a
technology_4
technology_9
which
be
similar
to
technology_27
but
it
keep
a
connector_17
active
unlike
technology_27
technology_9
which
be
a
quality_attribute_1
connector_data_2
connector_8
technology_9
and
close
the
connector_17
a
soon
a
a
connector_8
be
connector_18
from
the
component_1
websockets
be
the
best
technology_35
for
instant
pattern_1
where
the
connector_17
need
to
remain
active
during
the
chat
component_20
sockjs
be
a
technology_7
which
help
to
talk
via
technology_6
technology_9
or
fall
back
to
other
technology_36
long
pattern_9
comet
base
connector_16
if
technology_6
be
not
present
in
the
browser
the
connector_16
be
between
a
browser
component_4
and
a
component_1
have
an
implementation
for
websockets
i
e
ready
to
connector_14
technology_6
connector_data_5
it
connector_14
technology_27
connector_data_2
the
workflowif
you
look
at
the
figure
again
which
show
the
high
level
overview
it
start
with
the
web
browser
the
component_4
it
connector_7
the
first
technology_6
connector_data_2
use
the
sockjs
j
technology_7
on
the
component_4
side
technology_2
connector_14
it
and
open
a
technology_6
connector_17
between
the
browser
component_4
and
itself
component_1
technology_2
itself
start
an
independent
technology_10
connector_17
with
technology_3
use
the
pika
technology_7
for
each
active
technology_6
connector_17
it
create
this
create
a
whole
connector_data_3
flow
passage
start
from
the
cleint
to
technology_2
to
technology_3
and
back
to
component_4
note
that
technology_3
be
not
connector_19
to
the
component_7
directly
but
via
technology_2
this
be
important
from
quality_attribute_5
point
of
pattern_10
now
let’s
do
a
dry
run
of
people
chat
use
this
workflow
so
when
a
component_19
want
to
chat
in
a
chatroom
first
the
technology_6
connector_17
be
establish
then
technology_2
establish
an
technology_10
connector_17
with
technology_3
in
this
component_15
technology_2
create
pika
pattern_11
and
us
the
pattern_11
to
talk
to
an
exchange
and
attach
a
component_3
with
this
exchange
and
connector_17
with
a
particular
topic
technology_8
topic
determine
which
connector_data_4
pass
through
an
exchange
and
which
be
discard
what
we
be
use
here
be
pattern_12
mechanism
where
a
component_4
subscribe
to
a
pattern_11
which
be
determine
by
a
topic
and
when
some
other
component_4
publish
to
a
pattern_11
with
match
a
topic
pattern_13
then
the
exchange
pass
the
connector_data_3
to
the
subscribe
component_7
via
the
component_21
that
be
actually
attach
to
the
exchange
this
way
multiple
component_19
component_4
can

everybody
subscribe
to
the
pattern_11
connector_20
the
connector_data_3
similarly
if
two
person
component_4
want
to
talk
privately
then
each
of
them
would
subscribe
to
each
other’s
pattern_11
and
hence
when
anybody
connector_7
a

with
a
topic

match
the
receiver’s
attach
queue’s

the
receiver
connector_20
the
connector_data_3
there
be
mechanism
acknowledgement
which
can
help
you
determine
thing
connector_data_3
have
be
connector_2
already
or
not
then
there
be
way
trick
use
the
technology_6
connector_17
to
show
the
type
indication
all
of
these
be
connector_21
in
this
project
go
ahead
and
connector_22
the
component_22
from
technology_13
or
install
the
component_2
from
pypi
use
pip
install

if
you
have
any
