tl

the

some
use

furthermore
you
also

you
do
not

decouple

they

analysis

be
great
but
it
be
even
quality_attribute_11
if
you
can

maybe
even

quality_attribute_7
all

high
quality_attribute_15
build

to

however
even
if

the

typically
have
to
run


in

the

be
that
most

they

a

this
be
a
real
technology_21
however
it
have
all
the
pro
and
con
of
an

it
be
often
poorly
connector_19
by
the

require
an

on

in
most
scenario
i
have
see
connector_9

be
require
too
even
in
one
single

you
typically
have
many
different
technology_14

connector_23
paradigm
to
quality_attribute_8
there
be
more
than
the
component_9
and
plcs…
no
matter
how
you
quality_attribute_8
to
the

floor
component_22
this
be
the
first
step
to
connector_21
connector_data_1
correlate
with
other
component_16
from
your
requirement_18
connector_9
to
all
the
component_9
in
the
shop
floor
be
not
sufficient
requirement_8
and
combination
of
the
iot
connector_data_1
with
other
requirement_18
component_25
be
crucial
you
also
want
to
provide
and
sell
additional
component_10
in
the
connector_data_1
center
or
requirement_6
in
addition
you
might
even
want
to
quality_attribute_8
with
partner
and
supplier
this

additional
requirement_16
to
your
technology_16
you
can
provide
feature
you
don’t
sell
by
yourself
therefore
an

do
not
solve
all
the

there
be
huge

to

let’s
take
a

at
one
of
them
which
fit
perfectly
into
this
coding_keyword_1
eclipse
ditto
–
an
open_source
technology_13
for
build
a

with

it

therefore
ditto
and

complement
each

very
well
to

typically
mean
you
spin
up

the
follow
scenario
be
very
common
local

technology_2

in

floor
each

have

also
with

this
be
typically
a

sometimes
one
single

be

this
be
fine
if
you
do
not

and
prefer
low

and
very
quality_attribute_4

central

technology_2
cluster
be

in

each

be
use
to

and
aggregate
connector_data_1
from
different
factory
in
that

or
from
all
car
within

these
technology_2

be
big
than
the

a
they
need
to

edge
technology_2

the
requirement_8
can
be
realize
easily
and
quality_attribute_2
with
confluent

or
in
the
future
maybe
with
mirrormaker

if
it
mature
over

don’t
use

at

–
you
can
find
many
quality_attribute_11
reason
on

another
option
be
to
directly
quality_attribute_8

component_36
quality_attribute_7
at
the

to
a
central

either
with

use

you
can

in

then
replicate
the
connector_data_1
between

bidirectional
in

use

you
can
leverage

pattern_15
technology_2
feature
from

to
spin
up

this
be

–
there
be
no

you
need
to

you
