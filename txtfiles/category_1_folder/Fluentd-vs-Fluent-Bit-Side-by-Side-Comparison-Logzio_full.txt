we
all
a
pretty
requirement_10
for
u
connector_data_1
nerd
there’s
something
extremely
entice
about
the
color
and
graph
depict
our
environment
in
real
time
but
while
kibana
and
grafana
bask
in
glory
there
be
a
lot
of
heavy
lift
be
do
behind
the
scene
to
actually
connector_2
the
connector_data_1
this
be
where
technology_4
fluentd
and
fluent
bit
come
in
this
heavy
lift
be
perform
by
a
variety
of
different
technology_4
connector_3
requirement_1
forwarders
aggregator
or
shipper
these
technology_4
handle
the
connector_data_2
of
connector_4
and
connector_5
the
connector_data_1
from
multiple
component_5
transform
it
into
a
meaningful
set
of

and
eventually
connector_6
the
output
to
a

for

fluentd
be
one
of
the
most
popular
requirement_1

use
in

requirement_1

in
fact
it’s
so
popular
that
the

fluent
bit
be
a
relatively
player
in
town
but
be
also
rise
in
popularity
especially
in
technology_5

technology_6
environment
and
so
component_6
be
now
wonder
what
part
fluent
bit
should
and
can
play
in
a
requirement_1

be
this
a
and
improve
version
of
fluentd
should
we
retire
fluentd
in
favor
of
fluent

should
the
two
be
use
in
tandem
in
this

i’ll
be
provide
a
high

so
component_6
can
understand
the

between
the

and
when
to
use
them

requirement_11
quality_attribute_3

some
of

a

that
can
be
instal
a
agent
on

component_14

component_15
in

per

a
a

connector_12

connector_13
connector_data_1
to

connector_14
connector_data_1

fluent

use

of

capability

with

much
small
amount
of

for
quality_attribute_13
with
other
solution
sum
it
upthe
difference
between
fluentd
and
fluent

can
therefore
be
sum
up
simply
to
the
difference
between
requirement_1
forwarders

requirement_1
aggregator
the
former
be
instal
on
edge
component_14
to
connector_15

the
be
connector_10

the
requirement_1
aggregator
the
latter
be
daemon
that
connector_15
connector_16
of
from
the
requirement_1
forwarders
buffer
them
and
periodically
connector_17
the
connector_data_1
to
a
connector_data_1
component_18
of
some
sort
the
combination
of
fluentd
and
fluent
bit
be
become
extremely
popular
in
technology_6
deployment
because
of
the
way
they
compliment
each
other
—
fluent
bit
act
a
a
lightweight
shipper
connector_12
connector_data_1
from
the
different
technology_11
in
the
cluster
and
connector_13
the
connector_data_1
to
fluentd
for
aggregation
component_9
and
connector_11
to
any
of
the
support
output
destination
the
rise
of
technology_6
will
only
help
drive
adoption
of
fluent
bit
and
it
would
not
surprise
anyone
if
the
