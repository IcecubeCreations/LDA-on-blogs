out
the

overview
this
will
show
you
how
to
component_1
technology_1
use
only
core
technology_2
ee
without
the
use
of
third
party
connector_3
technology_7
or
technology_6
pretty
much
everything
we
ll
be
use
be
provide
by
the
javax

package

connector_4
an
connector_data_2
to
technology_1
coding_keyword_1
convert
a
technology_2
connector_data_2
into
a
technology_1
coding_keyword_1
be
super
easy
coding_keyword_2
s
assume
we
have
a
quality_attribute_2
person

coding_keyword_3
person
{
private
coding_keyword_1
firstname
private
coding_keyword_1
lastname
private
date
birthdate
getters
and
setter
}
to
convert
an
instance
of
that
to
a
technology_1
coding_keyword_1
first
we
need
to
create
an
instance
of
jsonobjectbuilder
and
property
requirement_1
pair
use
the


jsonobjectbuilder

it
can

most
of
the
primitive
type
a
well
a
component_4
connector_data_2
a
it

once
we

we

and
that
s
it
the
generate
coding_keyword_1
will
look
this
{

}


use
jsonarraybuilder
to
build
coding_keyword_5
now
to
a
little
more
complexity
to
our
example
coding_keyword_2
s
assume
that
the
person
be
modify
to
a
property
connector_7

which
will
contain
a
connector_data_3
of
connector_8
coding_keyword_3

coding_keyword_1

getters
and
setter
}
to
all
the
requirement_1
from
that
connector_data_3
to
the
jsonobjectbuilder
we
ll
need
the
help
of
jsonarraybuilder
jsonarraybuilder
arraybuilder
=
technology_8
createarraybuilder
for
coding_keyword_1
person
getemails
{
arraybuilder


}
objectbuilder


arraybuilder
notice
that
we
re
use
yet
another
overload
version
of
the

that
take
a
jsonarraybuilder
connector_data_2
a
it
second
parameter
so
coding_keyword_2
s
look
at
the
generate
coding_keyword_1
for
a
person
connector_data_2
with
two
connector_8
{
firstname
michael

technology_9
the
output
with
pretty_printing
so
we
have
successfully
convert
a
technology_2
connector_data_2
to
a
valid
technology_1
coding_keyword_1
now
before
move
to
the
next
section
coding_keyword_2
s
some
quality_attribute_2
technology_9
to
make
the
output
more
“json
like”
and
easy
to
connector_9
in
the
previous
example
we
create
a
jsonwriter
use
the
straightforward
technology_8
createwriter
coding_keyword_6

in
order
to
connector_1
more
control
of
the
generate
coding_keyword_1
we
will
leverage
technology_2

s
jsonwriterfactory
ability
to
create
a
writer
with
a
specific
configuration
connector_data_4
coding_keyword_1
boolean

try

createwriter

connector_6
coding_keyword_4
jsonstring
=

tostring
}
the
look
a
bit
verbose
but
it
really
doesn
t
do
much
first
it
create
an
instance
of
jsonwriterfactory
pass
a
configuration
connector_data_4
to
it
constructor
the
connector_data_4
contain
only
one
entry
which
set
true
to
the
pretty_printing
property
then
we
use
that
factory
instance
to
create
a
writer
instead
of
use
technology_8
createwriter
the
output
will
contain
the
distinctive
line
break
and
tabulation
that
characterize
a
technology_1
coding_keyword_1

build
a
technology_2
connector_data_2
from
a
coding_keyword_1
now
coding_keyword_2
s
do
the
opposite

convert
a
technology_1
coding_keyword_1
into
a
technology_2
connector_data_2
the
coding_keyword_7
part
of
the
conversion
component_1
revolve
around
coding_keyword_4
to
create
an
instance
of
this

use
the
coding_keyword_6
technology_8
createreader
follow
by
readobject
jsonreader
reader
=
technology_8
createreader

stringreader
jsonstring
coding_keyword_4
coding_keyword_4
=
reader
readobject
the
createreader
take
an
inputstream
a
a
parameter
in
this
example
we
re
use
a
stringreader
since
our
technology_1
be
contain
in
a
coding_keyword_1
connector_data_2
but
this
same
could
be
use
to
connector_9
content
from
a

for
example
use
fileinputstream
with
an
instance
of
coding_keyword_4
at
hand
we
can
connector_9
the
property
use
the
getstring
and
assign
the
obtain
requirement_1
to
a
newly
create
instance
of
our
person

use
jsonarray
to
connector_1
connector_data_3
requirement_1
we
ll
need
to
use
a
special

connector_7
jsonarray
to
extract
connector_data_3
requirement_1
from
coding_keyword_4
jsonarray
emailsjson
=
coding_keyword_4
getjsonarray

connector_data_3
coding_keyword_1

=
arraylist
for
jsonstring
j
emailsjson
getvaluesas

{


j
getstring
}
person
setemails

that
s
it
we
have
create
a
complete
instance
of
person
from
a
technology_8
coding_keyword_1

query
for
requirement_1
now
coding_keyword_2
s
assume
we
be
interest
in
a
very
specific
piece
of
connector_data_1
that
lie
inside
a
technology_1
coding_keyword_1
consider
the
technology_1
below
represent
a
component_5
from
a
pet
shop
coding_keyword_2
s
say
that
for
some
reason
you
need
to
connector_1
the
name
of
the
third
pet
from
the
pet
connector_data_3
{
ownername
robert
pet
{
name
kitty
type
cat
}
{
name
rex
type
dog
}
{
name
jake
type
dog
}
}
convert
the
whole
text
into
a
technology_2
connector_data_2
to
connector_1
a
single
requirement_1
wouldn
t
be
very
quality_attribute_3
so
coding_keyword_2
s
connector_2
a
couple
of
strategy
to
query
technology_1
coding_keyword_1
without
have
to
go
through
the
whole
conversion
ordeal


query
use
connector_data_2
component_6
component_2
query
for
a
property
s
requirement_1
with
a

location
in
the
technology_1
connector_data_5
be
straightforward
we
can
use
an
instance
of
coding_keyword_4
the
same
use
in
previous
example
jsonreader
reader
=
technology_8
createreader

stringreader
jsonstring
coding_keyword_4
coding_keyword_4
=
reader
readobject
coding_keyword_1
searchresult
=
coding_keyword_4
getjsonarray
pet
getjsonobject

getstring
name
the
catch
here
be
to
navigate
through
coding_keyword_4
property
use
the
correct
sequence
of
get*

in
this
example
we
first
connector_1
a
reference
to
the
“pets”
connector_data_3
use
getjsonarray
which
coding_keyword_8
a
connector_data_3
with

component_7
then
we
use
getjsonobject

which
take
an
index
a
a
parameter
coding_keyword_8
another
coding_keyword_4
represent
the
third
item
in
the
connector_data_3
finally
we
use
getstring
to
connector_1
the
coding_keyword_1
requirement_1
we
be
look
for


query
use
connector_10
component_2
another
way
to
perform
precise
connector_11
on
a
technology_1
coding_keyword_1
be
use
the
connector_10
technology_10
which
have
jsonparser
a
it
coding_keyword_7

jsonparser
provide
extremely
fast
connector_9
only
connector_12
connector_13
to
j
with
the
drawback
of
be
somewhat
more
complicate
than
the
connector_data_2
component_6
jsonparser
jsonparser
=
technology_8
createparser

stringreader
jsonstring
coding_keyword_9
count
=

coding_keyword_1
connector_data_6
=
coding_keyword_10
while
jsonparser
hasnext
{
e
=
jsonparser
next
if
e
==

key_name
{
if
jsonparser
getstring
equal
name
{
jsonparser
next
if
++count
==

{
connector_data_6
=
jsonparser
getstring
break
}
}
}
}
this
example
connector_14
the
same
connector_data_6
a
the
previous
one
it
coding_keyword_8
the
name
from
the
third
pet
in
the
pet
connector_data_3
once
a
jsonparser
be
create
use
technology_8
createparser
we
need
to
use
an
iterator
hence
the
“forward
access”
nature
of
the
jsonparser
to
navigate
through
the
technology_1
connector_data_7
until
we
connector_1
to
the
property
or
property
we
be
look
for
every
time
we
step
through
the
iterator
we
move
to
the
next
connector_data_7
of
the
technology_1
connector_data_1
so
we
have
to
be
careful
to
connector_2
if
the
current
connector_data_7
have
the
expect
type
this
be
do
by
connector_15
the
coding_keyword_8
by
the
next
connector_data_8
there
be
many
different
type
of
connector_data_7
in
this
example
we
be
interest
in
the
key_name
type
which
represent
the
name
of
a
property
e
g
“ownername”
“pets”
“name”
“type”
once
we
step
through
a
key_name
connector_data_7
with
a
requirement_1
of
“name”
for
the
third
time
we
that
the
next
connector_data_7
will
contain
a
coding_keyword_1
requirement_1
represent
the
name
of
the
third
pet
from
the
connector_data_3
this
be
definitely
hard
than
use
the
connector_data_2
component_6
technology_10
especially
for
more
complicate
technology_1
connector_data_5
the
choice
between
one
or
the
other
a
always
quality_attribute_4
on
the
specific
scenario
you
will
be
deal
with
