of

down

etc
if
the
be
one
single
large
monolithic
component_3
it
cannot
effectively
utilize
this
capability
of

infrastructure
because
the

sub

connector_4
pattern_4
across

be
the
bottle

which

not

be
one
of
the
important

style
help
in

there

more
architecture

and
design
principle
need
to

while

they

martin
each

must
be
responsible
for
a

or
a
requirement_12
or
aggregation
of

the
thump
rule
to
apply
this
principle
be
gather

which
connector_7
for
the

reason
separate
those

architectural
principle
in

orient
approach
it
recommend
design

to
reflect
the
real
world
domain
it
consider
the
requirement_11
domain
element
and
behavior
and
connector_6
between
requirement_11

for
example
in
bank
domain
individual
pattern_1
can
be

to
handle
various
requirement_11
such
a
retail
bank
on

bank
on

requirement_13
etc
the
retail
bank
pattern_3
can
offer

withdraw

technology_8
be
an
architecture
style
which
enforce
certain
principle
and
philosophy
follow
be
the
principle
of
pattern_5
to
be
adhere
while
design
pattern_1
for
requirement_1
encapsulationthe
component_14
must
pattern_6
the
internal
implementation
detail
so
that
the
external
component_3
utilize
the
component_14
need
not
worry
about
the
internals
pattern_7
reduce
the
complexity
and
enhance
the
quality_attribute_6
quality_attribute_7
to
connector_7
of
the
component_3
loose
couplingthe
connector_9
in
one
microsystem
should
have
zero
or
minimum
impact
on
other
component_14
in
the
eco
component_3
this
principle
also
suggest
have
a
loosely
couple
connector_5
between
the
pattern_1
a
per
technology_8
pattern_8
component_15
be
more
suitable
than
technology_1
technology_9
where
the
late
enforce
a
technology_3
on
other
pattern_1
separation
of
concerndevelop
the
pattern_1
base
on
distinct
feature
with
zero
overlap
with
other
the
objective
be
to
reduce
the
connector_6
between
component_14
so
that
they
be
highly
cohesive
and
loosely
couple
if
we
separate
the
requirement_12
across
wrong
boundary
will
lead
tight
couple
and
increase
complexity
between
component_10
the
above
core
principle
of
pattern_5
provide
only
a
gist
of
technology_8
there
be
more
principle
and
philosophy
of
pattern_5
which
nicely
fit
into
design
principle
of
pattern_1
for
requirement_1
hexagonal

propose
by

it
allow
an

to

where
the

handle
the

convert
them
into

for

golden
rule

so
that

the

where
it
suggest
have
