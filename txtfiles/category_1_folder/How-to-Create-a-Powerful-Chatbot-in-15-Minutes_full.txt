pre

requirement_1
here’s
where
to
find
a
bunch
of
them
there’s
a
lot
that
we
could
do
here
but
we’re
go
to
dive
straight
into
the
requirement_9
builder

open
up
the
requirement_9
builder
when
you
start
make
chatbots
you’ll
be
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
the
requirement_1
builder
let’s
open
it
up
and
start
look
around
there
be
two
option
when
opening
the
requirement_9
builder
—
dialogue
and
q&a
dialogue
be
the
heart
and
soul
of
chatbots
—
ask
question
provide
option
connector_5
content
basically
anything
that
a
requirement_1
do
q&a
involve
a
of
teaching
your
requirement_1
what
to
do
when
face
with
certain
keywords
for
example
if
a
requirement_3
be
connector_6
with
your
requirement_1
and
mention
requirement_2
or
cost
you
can
component_7
your
requirement_1
to
respond
with
requirement_2
connector_data_8
to
use
the
q&a
feature
you’ll
have
to
create
dialogue
that
be
connector_7
base
on
certain
keywords
so
we’re
go
to
work
on
dialogue
not
q&as
in
this
coding_keyword_3

open
the
dialogue
requirement_9
builder
when
you
open

builder
for
the
first
time
you’ll
see
a
pre

could
go
tell
your
bos
“i

that
take
five
minute

more
to
customize
thing

make
this
requirement_1
your
very
own
let’s
take
a
look
at
the
dialogue
builder
to
see
what’s
what
don’t
connector_1
overwhelm
at
first
pass

to
take
in
with
the

search
through
all

more
important
this
will
be
the
coding_keyword_2
