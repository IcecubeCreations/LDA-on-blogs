bernard

the
tech
world
be
all
agog
over
pattern_6
why
because
the
ability
to
break
up
monolithic

small
independently
manage
and
update
component_7
seem
a
heaven
connector_5

organization
overwhelm
by
demand
to

pattern_1
success
story
such
a
what
wix
have
accomplish
certainly
generate
excitement
but
pattern_6
design
isn
t
exactly
easy
in
truth
pattern_6
do
hold
enormous
potential
for
connector_1
the
requirement_1
component_2
grind
rule
pattern_6
base
component_6
you
quality_attribute_7
work
across
multiple
group
in
such
a
way
that
each
group
can
work
on
individual
component_2
section
without
impose
additional
work
on
the
others
pattern_1
architecture
also
you
decompose
an
component_2
into
independently
connector_6
component_8
you
can
update
individual
pattern_6
more
easily
and
place
the
connector_data_3
update
into
production
without
the
need
for
lengthy
requirement_7
work
across
all
of
your
different
development
team
unfortunately
most
of
the
connector_data_1
out
there
about
pattern_6
explain
why
you
should
use
them
but
not
how
it’s
quality_attribute_6
to
that
pattern_6
could
revolutionize
component_2
design
implementation
and
but
exactly
how
do
you
build
an
individual
pattern_1
you
need
to
understand
the
fundamental
component_7
of
a
pattern_1
if
you
want
the
connector_data_3
artifact
to
operate
properly
and
not
end
up
look
the
same
old
monolithic
component_2
with
a
paint
here
be
five
element
that
your
pattern_1
will
need
before
it
can
take
it
place
in
a
quality_attribute_7
component_2
architecture
properly
scoped
functionalitythe
big
design
issue
with
monolithic
component_2
architecture
be
that
there’s
so
much
in
them
that
connector_7
widely
differ
requirement_8
to
make
any
connector_1
to
a
monolithic
component_1
you
must
coordinate
across
different
group
in
order
to
ensure
that
everyone’s
continue
operate
properly
a
a
connector_data_3
developer
often
spend
more
time
on
requirement_7
and
test
than
on
connector_8
component_2
capability
for
this
reason
the
first
element
of
a
pattern_1
be
to
define
what
it
should
do
what
be
the
breadth
of
requirement_8
it
should
connector_9
on
their
initial
foray
into
pattern_6
many
people
be
concern
that
they’ll
overpartition
their
requirement_8
and
end
up
with
too
many
tiny
pattern_6
in
my
experience
overpartitioning
be
rarely
the
issue
it
s
more
common
to
stuff
too
much
into
each
component_8
one
way
to
define
the
proper
scope
be
to
component_9
the
component_10
along
logical
requirement_8
line
for
example
if
you
have
a
tax
pattern_7
in
your
monolithic
component_1
that
many
other
connector_data_4
it’s
a
candidate
to
be
break
out
into
it
own
component_8
another
scoping
approach
be
to
mirror
the
development
organization’s
connector_data_5
each
component_2
subgroup
e
g
the
pattern_8
group
responsible
for
component_3
identity
and
pattern_9
take
responsibility
for
create
one
or
more
pattern_6
for
the
requirement_8
that
fall
into
it
area
a
third
approach
recommend
in
the
excellent
build
pattern_6
book
by
sam
newman
be
to
minimize
a
component_8
to
the
amount
of
that
could
be
re
connector_9
by
the
team
in
a
two
week
period
ration
the
size
of
the
pattern_1
in
this
fashion
ensure
that
you’ll
avoid
the
problem
of
bloat
component_8
present
an
apionce
you
break
up
a
single
component_2
into
multiple
cooperate
component_8
how
should
the
component_10
talk
to
one
another
typically
this
be
do
with
pattern_10
web
component_10
component_11
connector_data_4
although
you
can
use
other
transport
mechanism
a
well
present
an
component_11
to
connector_10
component_10
in
some
way
represent
the
old
challenge
of
requirement_7
for
an
overall
component_2
to
run
properly
each
of
the
individual
component_10
must
be
able
to
quality_attribute_8
connector_5
and
connector_11
connector_data_2
and
test
that
component_12
operate
properly
be
necessary
to
ensure
that
everything
hang
together
the
foundation
of
an
component_11
be
connector_12
the
component_8
at
a
location
with
a
technology_3
that
when
connector_13
by
a
component_13
component_8
can
respond
with
the
appropriate
requirement_8
and
or
connector_14
connector_data_2
recognize
though
that
a
individual
component_10
mature
they
requirement_8
that
require
a
rich
technology_4
this
in
turn
imply
that
the
component_11
must
be
connector_15
alongside
the
old
one
absent
this
every
component_11
connector_1
cascade
into
a
requirement
that
all
caller
update
their
and
retest
which
connector_data_6
in
the
same
problem
that
monolithic
component_6
pose
it’s
a
quality_attribute_6
idea
to
avoid
jump
into
component_11
cod
immediately
instead
do
some
work
on
paper
or
whiteboards
to
define
what
a
specific
component_8
must
connector_16
to
operate
properly
it
will
undoubtedly
take
several
iteration
to
fully
flesh
out
an
component_11
capable
of
present
the
component_8
behind
the

everything’s
ok
right

no
actually
in
the
real
world
of

a

and
connector_data_7
to
it
to
take
a
long
time
or
a
component_8
can
be
overwhelm
with
connector_data_7
and
lack
the
component_14
power
need
to
respond
quickly
enough
even
bad
a
component_8
might
simply
stop
run
due
to
a
or
hardware
crash
and
sometimes
a
component_13
be
issue
too
many

for
the
lower
level

connector_17
this

situation
require
requirement_6
there
must
be
a
way
for

component_10
to

and
coordinate

from
the
perspective

should
always
track

be
prepare

terminate
them
if
the
connector_14
take
too
long
from
the
perspective
of
the
connector_13
component_8
the
component_11
design
should
include
the
ability
to
connector_5
a
connector_14
that
indicate
overload
this
connector_14
typically
refer
to
a
backpressure
signal
that
the
connector_10
component_8
should
reduce
or
redirect
it
load
one
important
note
here
about
manage
traffic
connector_10
component_10
should
have
a
graceful
way
to
handle
a
nonresponsive
connector_13
component_8
if
the
connector_data_1
the
connector_13
component_8
be
suppose
to
be
unavailable
then
your
connector_10
component_8
should
still
be
able
to
connector_19
that
the
connector_13
component_8
will
not
respond
and
continue
to

up

this

that

quite
different
from

of

to

inevitably
mean
a
more
complex
component_2

—
a
lot
more
complex
for
this
reason
traditional
