to

the

which
directly
determine
whether
you
can
achieve
out

if

of

do
not

then
secondary
development
be
require
which
increase
the
technical
difficulty

project
cycle
of
the

functional

the
functional

can
be
divide

multiple
sub

which
can
be
roughly
divide

the
follow
priority
component_7
the
priority
component_7
be
different
from
the

component_7
and
the
connector_data_1
with
high
priority
have
the
privilege
of
be
preferentially
connector_6
which
can
provide
different
connector_data_1
level
guarantee
for
the
downstream
however
this
priority
also
need
to
have
a
premise
if
the
component_16
s
consumption
quality_attribute_15
be
great
than
the
component_17
s
quality_attribute_15
and
there
be
no
connector_data_1
accumulation
in
the
connector_data_1
technology_1
component_14
generally
simply
connector_3
the
pattern_7
then
set
the
priority
for
the
connector_7
connector_data_1
there
be
no
substantive
mean
because
the
component_17
have
connector_6
a
connector_data_1
and
be
connector_6
by
the
component_16
which
be
equivalent
to
at
most
one
connector_data_1
in
the

for
a

when
you
shop

do
you
encounter

the

do
not

component_7
base
delay
connector_data_1
base
quality_attribute_16
refer
to
set
different
delay
time
for
each

so
each
time
a
connector_data_1
enter
the
component_7
it
will
be
sort
accord
to
the
delay
time
of

this
will
also
have
a
great
impact
on
requirement_5
most
of
the
practical
component_18
use
component_7
base
delay
and
set
component_8
with

the
delay

thus
eliminate

connector_3
a
dead

correspond
to
this
be
also
a
concept
of
coding_keyword_1
component_7
imagine
if
the
component_16
have
an
abnormality
during

then
this
purchase
will
not

and
then
the
connector_data_1
after
the

occur
will
be
place
at
the
top
of
the
component_7
and
then
continuously
component_6
and
roll
back
cause
the
component_7
to
fall
into
an
infinite
loop
in
order
to
solve
this
problem
a
back
off
component_7
can
be
set
for
each
component_7
and
the
dead

component_7
be
a
mechanism
guarantee
for
the

component_6
in
practice
the
role
of
the

component_7
can
be
play
by
the

component_7
and
the

the

can
be
regard
a
a

specifically
when
the

to
prevent

unlike
the
back

component_7
the

component_7
be
generally
divide

each

be
also
generally
set
to
re

delay
the
more
retry
time
the
great
the

delay
for
example
the
first
time
the
connector_data_1
fail
to
enter
the
retry
component_7
q1
the
re
delivery
delay
of
q1
be
5
and
the
connector_data_1
be
re
connector_11
after
5
if
the
connector_data_1
fail
to
connector_6
again
it
enter
the
retry
component_7
q2
and
the
re
delivery
delay
of
q2
be
10
the
connector_data_1
be
connector_11
again
after
10
by
analogy
the
long
the
retry
be
repeat
the
long
it
take
to
re

for
this
purpose
you
need
to
set

the

will
enter
the

component_7
the
retry
component_7
have
the
same
place
a
the
delay
component_7
it
be
necessary
to
set
the
delay
level
the
difference
between
them
be
that
the
delay
component_7
action
be
connector_13
internally
the
retry
component_7
action
be
connector_13
by
the
external
component_16
the

component_7
act

and
the

component_7
the
scope
of

will
be
pass

pattern_8
the

mean
that
the

the

however
technology_3
can
achieve
the

technology_2
can

you
can
completely
regard

group
a
the

however
in
contrast
in
technology_2
because
of
the
existence
of

backtrack

the
support
for

consumption
be
strong
than

the

anymore
the
connector_data_1

be
the
opposite
it
mean
that
after

the
connector_data_1
can
be
connector_6
until
it
be
connector_6
for
the

the
problem
often
be
“message

a
for
the
loss
of
the
connector_data_1
technology_1
or
the
loss
of
the
user’s
misuse
it
be
generally
difficult
to
trace
if
the
connector_data_1
technology_1
itself
have
the
connector_data_1

the
miss
connector_data_1
can
be

to
find
out
where
the

be
the

effect
of

be
far
more
than
this
for

there
be

connector_data_1

this

in

sense
if

we

the

be
also
an

to

consider
at

for

the

be
an
example
it
be
possible
that

then
this

there
be
a
connector_data_1

level
to

if

the

there
be
a

of
connector_data_1

that
support

both

the

contradictory
fish

technology_2
will
reduce

when
it

technology_3
open
rabbitmq_tracing

it
will
also
greatly
affect
it
requirement_5
the
requirement_5
of
connector_data_1
technology_1
generally
refer
to
it
quality_attribute_12
although
the
advantage
of
technology_3
be
great
than
that
of
technology_2
in
term
of
functional
dimension
the
quality_attribute_12
of
technology_2
be

to

order
of
magnitude
high
than
that
of
technology_3
generally
the
stand
alone
qps
of
technology_3
be
at
the
level
of


within
technology_2
s
stand
alone
qps
can
be
maintain
at


or
even
million
the
quality_attribute_12
of
connector_data_1
technology_1
be
always
limit
by
the
hardware
level
take
the
nic
bandwidth
a
an
example
if
the
bandwidth
of
a
single
nic
be

gbps
if
you
want
to
achieve
a
million
level
quality_attribute_12
the
connector_data_1
size
must
not
exceed
1gb

100w
which
be
equal
to
134b
in
other
word
if
the
connector_data_1
body
with
a
size
of
more
than
134b
it
be
impossible
to
achieve
a
million
level
quality_attribute_12
this
calculation
can
also
be
apply
to
both
memory
and
disk
a
an
important
indicator
of
the
requirement_5
dimension
time
delay
be
often
neglect
in
the
of
connector_data_1
technology_1
because
the
requirement
of
timeliness
for
the
use
of
connector_data_1
technology_1
be
not
very
high
if
timeliness
be
require
it
can
be
connector_4
by
pattern_23
connector_data_1
technology_1
have
the
ability
to
accumulate
connector_data_1
the
large
the
connector_data_1
technology_25
the
long
the
end
to
end
delay
at
the
same
time
the
delay
component_7
be
also
a
feature
of
some
connector_data_1
technology_1
so
why
pay
attention
to
the
delay
of
connector_data_1
technology_1
the
connector_data_1
technology_1
can
decouple
the
component_2
for
a
connector_data_1
technology_1
with
low
quality_attribute_16
it
can
allow
the
upstream
component_17
to
coding_keyword_1
after
connector_29
the
connector_data_1
quickly
and
also
allow
the
component_16
to
connector_10
the
connector_data_1
more
quickly
without
accumulate
in
this
requirement_9
the
cascade
action
between
the
entire
upstream
and
downstream
component_18
can
be
more
quality_attribute_1
although
it
be
not
recommend
to
use
the
connector_data_1
technology_1
in
a
time
sensitive
scenario
if
the
connector_data_1
technology_1
use
be
excellent
in
delay
so
the
requirement_5
of
the
overall
component_2
will
be
a
big
improvement
quality_attribute_9
+
quality_attribute_13
connector_data_1
loss
be
a
common
point
that
must
be
face
when
use
connector_data_1
technology_1
the
quality_attribute_9
of
the
connector_data_1
behind
it
be
also
a
key
factor
in
measure
the
quality
of
connector_data_1
technology_1
especially
in
the
of
financial
payment
connector_data_1
quality_attribute_9
be
particularly
important
however
when
it
come
to
quality_attribute_9
it
be
necessary
to
talk
about
quality_attribute_10
pay
attention
to
the
difference
between
the
two
the
quality_attribute_9
of
connector_data_1
technology_1
refer
to
the
degree
of
guarantee
that
the
connector_data_1
be
not
lose
the
quality_attribute_13
of
connector_data_1
technology_1
refer
to
the
percentage
of
time
for
trouble
free

usually
measure
in
a
few
nine
from
a
narrow
perspective
the
quality_attribute_3
component_2
architecture
be
the
component_4
implementation
of
the
pattern_24
technology_13
theory
and
can
be
trace
back
to
the
consistency
technology_13
behind
the
connector_data_1
technology_1
for
connector_data_1
quality_attribute_9
and
quality_attribute_13
for

it
us
a

and
continue
to
provide
component_32
to

quality_attribute_13
technology_2
be
originally
design
for

component_6
leave
people
with
a
bad
impression
of
connector_data_2
quality_attribute_9
requirement
but
with
the
upgrade
of
the
version
it
quality_attribute_9
have
be
greatly
enhance
please
refer
to
kip101
for
detail
at
present
most
of
the
use
of
technology_3
in
the
financial
payment

and
technology_2
use
in
requirement_12
component_6
requirement_13
etc
with
the
continuous
improvement
of
technology_3
requirement_5
and
the
further
enhancement
of
technology_2
quality_attribute_9
i
believe
that
each
other
can
not
be
quality_attribute_14
at
the
past
the
have
a
connector_31
pattern_26
brush
be
an
quality_attribute_18
way
to
enhance
the
quality_attribute_9
of
a
component_33
connector_data_1
technology_1
be
no
exception
technology_2
and
technology_3
can
support
pattern_26
brush
but
i
have
some
doubt
about
pattern_26
brush
in
most
requirement_9
one
component_33
quality_attribute_9
should
not
be
guarantee
by
the
extremely
lossy
requirement_5
of
the
pattern_26
brush
but
by
a
multi
copy
mechanism
one
aspect
that
i
want
to
mention
here
be
the
quality_attribute_11
here
i
narrowly
narrow
this
into
the
dimension
of
quality_attribute_10
the
extension
of
connector_data_1
technology_1
can
enhance
the
quality_attribute_10
and
scope
of
it
use
for
example
the
aforementioned
technology_3
support
multiple
connector_data_1
technology_13
this
be
an
extension
implementation
base
on
it
plugin
also
from
the
perspective
of
cluster
deployment
thanks
to
technology_2
s
horizontal
quality_attribute_11
it
can
basically
reach
the
level
of
linear
capacity
improvement
in
the
introduction
to
linkedin
there
be
mention
technology_2
cluster
with
more
than
one
thousand
component_34
quality_attribute_19
and
quality_attribute_20
requirement_14
in
the
component_6
of
use
the
connector_data_1
technology_1
various
exception
will
inevitably
occur
there
be
component_27
and
component_14
so
how
to
pattern_27
and
repair
them
in
a
timely
and
quality_attribute_18
manner
requirement_11
line
traffic
have
peak
and
valley
especially
in
the
e
commerce
sector
so
how
do
you
conduct
quality_attribute_18
capacity
assessment
before
especially
during
the
promotion
period
there
be
endless
activity
such
a
kick
power
and
requirement_7
cable
be
dig
how
to
effectively
do
more
live
and
work
these
be
inseparable
from
the
derivative
of
the
connector_data_1
technology_1
and
quality_attribute_20
requirement_14
and
quality_attribute_20
requirement_14
can
also
be
further
subdivide
such
a
component_4
audit
pattern_27
alarm
requirement_14
disaster
recovery
deployment
etc
the
component_4
and
review
be
well
understand
the
resource
be
control
and
control
at
the
component_35
it
can
effectively
correct
the
component_4
specification
of
the
component_4
the
distribution
and
pattern_28
can
also
do
the
traffic
statistic
and
traffic
assessment
the
general
component_4
audit
and
the
internal
component_2
of
the
requirement_4
be
more
quality_attribute_21
large
not
suitable
for
use
with
open_source
technology_6
pattern_28
and
alarm
be
also
well
understand
the
pattern_28
of
the
use
of
connector_data_1
technology_1
can
provide
the
benchmark
connector_data_2
for
the
component_2
and
can
also
cooperate
with
the
alarm
when
the
abnormality
be
detected
so
that
the
and
quality_attribute_20
and
the
rapid
intervention
of
the
developer
in
addition
to
general
pattern_28
connector_data_10
such
a
hardware
gc
etc
connector_data_1
technology_1
also
need
to
pay
attention
to
end
to
end
delay
connector_data_1
audit
connector_data_1
technology_25
and
so
on
for
technology_3
the
most
orthodox
pattern_28
requirement_14
technology_37
be
the
rabbitmq_management
plugin
but
there
be
many
excellent

technology_2
be
also

technology_2
pattern_27
technology_2

can
do
more
with

the

generally
it
be

be
a
component_26
room
failure
it
will
involve
remote
disaster
recovery
the
key
point
be
how
to
effectively
copy
connector_data_2
for
technology_2
you
can
refer
to
mirrormarker
ureplicator
etc
and
technology_3
can
refer
to
federation
and
shovel
strength
and
ecological
development
for
the
current
popular
programming
technology_11
such
a
technology_10
and
technology_38
if
you
encounter
some
exception
during
use
you
can
basically
solve
them
with
the
help
of
search
component_36
because
the
more
people
use
a
technology_6
the
pit
you
step
on
the
more
the
more
solution
there
be
the
same
apply
to
connector_data_1
technology_1
if
you
choose
a
kind
of
uncommon
connector_data_1
technology_1
it
be
handy
in
some
aspect
but
the
version
be
slow
to
update
and
it
be
difficult
to
connector_10
support
from
the
and
it
be
connector_32
stick
on
the
contrary
if
you
choose
a
popular
connector_data_1
technology_1
it
be
more
powerful
not
only
can
quickly
make
up
for
the
previous
deficiency
but
also
can
adapt
to
the
rapid
development
of
technology_26
to
connector_17
some
feature
so
that
you
can
stand
on
the
shoulder
of
giant
in
the
dimension
of
and
quality_attribute_20
requirement_14
we
mention
that
both
technology_2
and
technology_3
have
a
series
of
open_source
pattern_28
and
requirement_14
technology_6
which
be
benefit
from
the
rapid
development
of
their

and
ecology
fourth
the
discussion
of
the
misunderstanding
of
connector_data_1
technology_1
selection
before
ask
for
connector_data_1
technology_1
you
can
ask
yourself
a
question
do
you
really
need
a
connector_data_1
technology_1
after
you
have
figure
out
this
problem
you
can
continue
to
ask
yourself
a
question
do
you
need
to
maintain
a
set
of
connector_data_1
technology_1
yourself
in
order
to
connector_33
cost
many
start
up
requirement_4
choose
to
directly
purchase
requirement_15
component_32
relate
to
connector_data_1
technology_1
they
only
need
to
pay
attention
to
connector_29
and
connector_34
connector_data_1
and
the
rest
can
be
outsource
many
people
have
a
self
study
impulse
when
face
connector_data_1
technology_1
you
can
make
a
quality_attribute_22
wrapper
around
arrayblockingqueue
in
technology_10
you
can
also
form
a
connector_data_1
technology_1
base
on
the
underlie
storage
pattern_5
of

component_37
technology_22
and
so
on
a
a
basic
component_33
the
connector_data_1
technology_1
be
not
a
quality_attribute_22
a
it
be
suppose
to
be
it
also
need
a
set
of
technology_6
to
manage
the
whole
ecosystem
self
research
will
also
have
problem
with
handover
if
the
document
be
incomplete
and
the
be
not
standardize
it
will
bring
a
nightmare
experience
to
the
newcomer
be
it
really
necessary
to
have
self
study
if
it
be
not
the
oppression
of
kpi
you
can
consider
these
two
question
first

be
the
current
connector_data_1
technology_1
on
the
requirement_3
really
unable
to
meet
the
current
requirement_11
need

do
the
team
have
sufficient
capacity
manpower
financial
resource
and
energy
to
support
self
study
many
people
refer
to
many
comparative

on
the
internet
when
they
be
make
connector_data_1
technology_1
selection
but
their
professionalism
rigor
and
political
position
be
still
to
be
verify
they
need
to
be
examine
with
suspicion
for
example
some

will
directly
define
a
connector_data_1
technology_1
without
any
qualification
and
scenario
some

do
not
specify
the
connector_data_1
technology_1
version
and
test
environment
for
functional
and
requirement_5
comparison
analysis
stubborn
connector_data_1
technology_1
be
a
pony
cross
the
river
it
be
most
important
to
choose
the
right
one
this
need
to
fit
your
own
requirement_11
need
the
technology_26
serve
the
requirement_11
generally
it
can
be
base
on
the
six
dimension
of
and
requirement_5
mention
in
the
previous
section
one
be
for
screen
the
deep
choice
be
whether
you
can
master
the
soul
the
author
glimps
technology_3
lie
in
connector_35
and
technology_2
lie
in
connector_20

that
it
be
especially
important
for
you
to
choose
the
right
connector_data_1
technology_1
for
the
right
medicine
connector_data_1
technology_1
selection
should
not
blindly
pursue
requirement_5
or

requirement_5
can
be
optimize
and
can
be
develop
twice
if
you
want
to
make
a
choice
between
and
requirement_5
then
the
requirement_5
be
prefer
because
in
general
the
space
for
requirement_5
optimization
have
no
room
for
functional
expansion
for
long
term
development
however
ecology
be
more
important
than
requirement_5
and

many
time
there
be
a
misunderstanding
about
quality_attribute_9
to
find
a
technology_6
to
ensure
the
absolute
quality_attribute_9
of
the
connector_data_1
unfortunately
there
be
no
absolute
thing
in
the
world
can
only
say
that
it
be
a
perfect
a
possible
to
ensure
the
quality_attribute_9
of
the
connector_data_1
a
much
a
possible
it
be
not
only
rely
on
the
connector_data_1
technology_1
itself
but
also
rely
on
the
upstream
and
downstream
it
be
necessary
to

connector_data_1
