welcome
to
the
penultimate
part
of
this

i’ve
really

a
lot
connector_1
this
and
i
hope
you
have
too
in
part

we
be
able
to
acheive
our
coding_keyword_1
goal
of
the
which
be
to
build
a
web
base
chat
component_1
with
technology_6
and
technology_5
but
we
face
a
major
issue
with
quality_attribute_1
the
component_1
websockets
from
the
last

we
go
through
a
little
primer
on
websockets
we
they’re
pattern_1
directional
connector_2
that
stay
open
and
allow
the
component_2
to
connector_3
instantly
with
the
component_3
and
vice
versa
technology_1
itself
be
develop
at
a
different
time
in
our
internet
history
back
then

web
component_4
weren’t
a
sophisticate
a
they
be
today
it
be
basically
“hey
i
want
the

from
the
1st
of
2005”
and
then
the
component_2
go
“don’t
worry
bro
i
connector_4
you”
and
do
some
work
fetch
the

and
then
respond
“here
be
the

you
ask
for”
and
then
it
go
back
to
sleep
or
attend
to
other
component_5
close
the
connector_data_1
you
couldn’t
connector_5
connector_data_2
without
ask
for
it
for
example
the
web
component_2
couldn’t
say
“someone
in
lagos
connector_6
you
a
connector_data_3
here
be
the
message”
you’ll
need
to
ask
the
web
component_2
“please
coding_keyword_2
me
see
all
my
unread
messages”
don’t
mind
these
stupid
example
what
we
can
draw
from
this
be
that
the
connector_7
could
only
be
initiate
from
one
person
the
component_3
this
be
really
a
problem
for
technology_1
and
a
lot
of
technology_7
web
technology_8
because
the
underlie
technology_9
that
govern
how
technology_7
component_4
should
run
technology_10
be
tie
down
to
this
connector_data_4
connector_8
pattern_2
of
connector_7
so
many
people
approach
the
problem
from
different
angle
by
technology_8
web
component_6
e
g
twist
technology_11
pattern_3
component_7
with
technology_12
component_6
e
g
gevent
by

support
to
exist
technology_10
component_6
technology_3
modify
technology_6
directly
be
go
to
be
difficult
because
it
be
go
to
require
some
drastic
connector_9
in
the
core
of
technology_6
due
to
it’s
pattern_4
nature
and
the
technology_10
technology_9
itself
technology_6
pattern_5
andrew
godwin
bring
websockets
to
technology_6
natively
with
technology_6
pattern_5
at
the
time
this
be
connector_10
it’s
currently
an
official
project
of
the
technology_6
foundation
mean
it’s
not
go
anywhere
soon
technology_6
pattern_5
introduce
a
technology_9
connector_11
asgi
that’s
distinctly
different
from
technology_10
technology_6
pattern_5
come
with
it’s
own
web
component_2
connector_11
daphne
daphne
can
handle
regular
technology_13
connector_2
and
technology_12
connector_2
if
you
decide
to
go
with
technology_6
pattern_5
you
have
to
it’s
component_8
and

you’ll
also
need
to
connector_12
your
deployment
component_9
to
quality_attribute_2
to
horizontally
to
multiple
component_10
you’ll
still
need
to
make
use
of
a
what
technology_6
pattern_5
connector_data_5
pattern_5
pattern_6
the
recommend
pattern_6
be
the
technology_14
pattern_6
there’s
also
a
technology_2
pattern_5
pattern_6
and
an
pattern_7
inter
pocess
connector_7
pattern_6
these
pattern_5
pattern_6
be
the
glue
between
technology_6
and
the
daphne
component_2
the
technology_14
and
technology_2
in
particular
be
use
to
quality_attribute_2
pattern_5
horizontally
the
pattern_7
pattern_5
pattern_6
be
quicker
but
it’s
only
suitable
for
a
single
component_2
because
all
the
component_11
use
a
connector_13
memory
for
connector_7
there’s
also
some
downside
to
use
the
technology_14
pattern_5
technology_14
doesn’t
have
tl
support
natively
and
it’s
support
for
persistent
component_12
isn’t
that
great
compare
to
technology_2
also
due
to
the
asgi
specification
technology_6
pattern_5
emulate
pattern_8
it
doesn’t
actually
use
the
pattern_8
capability
of
technology_14
or
technology_2
which
isn’t
great
if
you
need
to
listen
directly
on
a
pattern_5
at
the
end
of
the
day
we’re
go
to
build
a
similar
component_13
to
technology_6
pattern_5
more
a
“poor
man’s”
technology_6
pattern_5
but
on
a
lower
level
we’re
go
to
connector_14
from
technology_2
component_12
directly
technology_6
pattern_5
abstract
this
into
group
technology_3
would
take
a
similar
role
a
the
daphne
component_2
the
difference
be
our
approach
doesn’t
limit
u
to
a
single
technology_12
component_2
technology_6
pattern_5
you
can
easily
replace
technology_3
with
another
technology_12
component_2
with
minimal
work
there
be
ongoing
plan
for
technology_6
pattern_5
to
support
other
“interface”
aside
daphne
technology_3
websockets
unbit
the
developer
of
technology_3
take
a
different
approach
they
decide
to
quality_attribute_3
websockets
into
the
technology_3
core
itslf
technology_3
be
a
very
performant
technology_10
web
component_2
for
technology_7
it’s
arguably
the
most
popular
technology_7
technology_10
component_2
it
also
support
several
programming
technology_15
technology_16
technology_17
even
go
if
you
currently
use
technology_3
in
your
technology_18
and
you
need
websockets
you
don’t
need
to
connector_12
anything
even
if
you
use
a
different
technology_10
component_2
technology_19
you
need
to
pip
install
technology_3
it’s
that
quality_attribute_4
if
you
remember
the
discussion
we
have
early
in
part

about
technology_2
remember
i
tell
you
technology_2
be
the
glue
between
technology_3
and
technology_6
we
need
to
create
connector_data_6
and
put
them
on
the
technology_2
component_14
and
then
through
the
websockets
this
connector_data_7
can
be
pattern_9
directly
to
multiple
component_15
to
ease
the
component_9
of
create
connector_data_6
and
connector_15
them
to
technology_2
i
create

anything
you

even
come

that

because
it’s

have

a

an

be
a

that

from
a

our

and
then
pattern_9
it
to

there
be
four
different
type

namely
direct

coding_keyword_8

it’s

the

there
be

you

use

manually

there’s

this
establish

if

for

an

would

this
be
actually
deceptive
and
mislead
really
i’m
serious
because
even
though
the

be

connector_5
non
pattern_14
it
doesn’t
only
connector_5
connector_data_7
in

manner
it
also
help
to
maintain
the

with
the

by

a
pong
to
the

pattern_16
mechanicsm
to

if
the

be
still
alive
the
keep
alive
connector_data_15
this
every

second
without
that
the

might
disconnect
the
connector_2
typically
after
a
minute
of
inactivity
if
it
doesn’t
hear
from
the
component_2
technology_3
websocket_send
you
don’t
need
a
sooth
sayer
to
tell
you
about
this
one
though
the
reason
we
need
the
error
pattern_17
be
in
requirement_1
the
connector_2
be
close
and
we
try
to
connector_18
a
connector_data_3
technology_3
websocket_send
would
raise
an
oserror
we’ll
close
the
connector_2
to
technology_2
and
kill
the
component_9
technology_3
will
take
care
of
restart
it
for
u
also
the
else
block
would
never
run
which
mean
we
won’t
acknowledge
the
connector_data_3
and
it
would
stay
on
the
component_14
the
next
time
we
enter
the
for
loop
and
connector_data_5
pattern_5
connector_24
would
connector_18
the
unacknowledged
connector_data_3
plus
any
connector_data_7
in
the
component_14
which
mean
we’ll
never
miss
any
connector_data_3
due
to
requirement_3
connector_28
do
you
notice
that
the
exchange
uri
be
no
long
hardcoded
instead
we
connector_4
the
exchange
name
from
the
connector_2
url
which
would
require
our
component_20
to
connector_16
to
a
url
this
technology_13
technology_12
component_2
uri
don’t
worry
if
this
doesn’t
make
any
sense
to
you
when
we
finally
connector_16
our
technology_24
frontend
to
the
technology_12
component_2
it’ll
clear
a
lot
of
thing
up
connector_16
to
the
technology_12
with
technology_25
it’s
impossible
to
talk
about
websockets
in
the
component_26
of
a
web
component_1
without
technology_25
most
modern
browser
already
support
websockets
so
we
don’t
need
to

now
start
the
technology_3
technology_12
component_2
on

and
reload
the
browser
$
technology_3
technology_13


technology_12
master
component_9

hooray
you
should
be
able
to
connector_18
connector_data_7
and
see
them
appear
in
realtime
hooray
there’s
still
a
problem
open

more
tab

active
component_3
the
last
component_3
wouldn’t
be
able
to
connector_16
because
the

component_11
we
specify
be
tie
down
by
other
component_3
note
that’s
a
reason
why
we
need
to
kill
stick
component_11
immediately
with
sys
exit

because
the
component_9
not
really
be
stick
the
component_15
might
have
intentionally
leave
the
chat
room
and
it
would
take
technology_3
sometime
to
figure
out
that
the
component_3
have
disconnect
before
close
the
connector_2
on
the
component_2
the
–master
option
invoke
the
master
component_9
which
pattern_19
dead
component_11
and
restart
them
without
this
the
component_9
would
die
and
never
be
restart
and
it
would
continue
until
the
last
component_9
die
and
technology_3
exit
so
why
be
this
happen
i
think
you
say
websockets
quality_attribute_2
yes
i
say
that
the
reason
our
current
setup
won’t
quality_attribute_2
be
simply
because
of
the
way
we’re
run
technology_3
with
component_11
and
component_28
a
normal
technology_7
technology_10
component_2
run
an
easy
solution
would
be
to
increase
the
component_11
but
that
can
only
take
u
to
probably
a
few
hundred
component_5
or
le
quality_attribute_6
on
your
server’s
resource
pattern_11
io
and
pattern_20
pattern_11
io
deserve
an
entire
on
it’s
own
if
you
don’t
have
the
slight
idea
about
what
it
be
i’ll
advice
you
to
go
crazy
on
and
connector_14
every
you
can
find
basically
the
idea
behind
asyncio
or
simply
pattern_3
be
when
we
have
multiple
io
bind
connector_data_11
that
we
need
to
run
during
the
say
io
in
our
requirement_1
connector_15
and
connector_30
connector_data_3
instead
of
the
component_9
sit
idle
wait
for
the
connector_data_3
it
can
quickly
switch
to
another
io
bind
connector_data_12
and
run
it
this
quality_attribute_4
concept
high
level
explanation
be
what
make
nodejs
so
much
for
io
bind
component_1
for
technology_7
and
technology_3
thing
be
a
little
different
because
they
be
not
pattern_11
by
design
there
be
several
pattern_3
technology_20
for
technology_7
the
official
asyncio
gevent
curio
etc
technology_3
itself
support
some
of
these
technology_20
asyncio
be
one
of
them
but
we’re
go
to
use
gevent
from
my
experience
i
find
gevent
work
quality_attribute_7
compare
to
asyncio
and
ugreen
gevent
also
have
a
lot
of
useful

for
example
monkey
patch_all
which
replace
most
of
the
technology_27
technology_20
with
gevent’s
technology_20
and
allow
you
connector_10
pattern_4
that’s
connector_31
asynchronously
install
gevent
with
pip
$
pip
install
gevent
now
you
need
to
start
the
technology_3
technology_12
component_2
this
$
technology_3
technology_13

gevent


technology_12
gevent
monkey
patch
master
first
we’re
start
with

gevent
component_28
and
a
single
component_9
that
mean
we
can
only
handle
two
component_20
reasonably
it
flunctuates
between

and

component_20
randomly
but
most
time
only

component_20
connector_5
connector_data_7
quality_attribute_8
when
more
component_20
try
to
join
in
you’ll
connector_4
a
warn
in
the
technology_3
say
pattern_3
component_14
be
full
there
be
two
way
you
can
quality_attribute_2
up
the
easy
way
be
to
increase
the
number
of
gevent
component_28
actually
greenlets
that
be
run
if
we
connector_12
the
technology_3
startup
to
this
$
technology_3
technology_13

gevent


technology_12
gevent
monkey
patch
master
boom
that
we
can
handle

concurrent
component_15
what
about
have
multiple
component_9
that’s
the
second
way
of
quality_attribute_1
up
you
can
have
multiple
component_11
let’s
start
the
technology_3
component_2
with

component_11
$
technology_3
technology_13

gevent


technology_12
gevent
monkey
patch
master
component_9


component_11
*

–gevent
component_28
that’s

concurrent
component_5
already
quality_attribute_6
on
your
server’s
spec
and
configuration
you
can
increase
the
number
of
component_11
and
gevent
component_28
but
before
do
this
make
sure
you
profile
and
pattern_19
your
application’s
requirement_5
because
at
a
certain
stage
increasing
number
will
cause
degrade
requirement_5
technology_3
feature
a
technology_7
package
quality_attribute_9
from
pip
connector_11
uwsgitop
that
can
be
use
for
pattern_21
it
but
that’s
out
of
the
scope
of
this

maybe
i’ll
connector_10
about
it
in
the
future
quality_attribute_1
out
to
multiple
component_6
at
a
certain
point
we’ll
max
out
our
server’s
resource
and
we’ll
need
to
quality_attribute_2
out
to
multiple
component_2
since
our
technology_12
component_2
isn’t
couple
to
our
coding_keyword_1
technology_6
component_1
that’s
fairly
easy
because
we
can
load
balance
multiple
component_6
each
run
multiple
technology_3
component_11
and
gevent
component_29
behind
technology_28
and
before
you
it
you’ll
be
handle
thousand
of
connector_2
easily
you
can
also
apply
the
same
cluster
and
loadbalancing
technique
to
technology_2
when
you
need
to
quality_attribute_2
out
though
not
with
technology_28
since
technology_2
doesn’t
use
technology_13
take
a
look
at
the
documentation
technology_13
www
technology_2
technology_29
ha
technology_30
well
well
well…that’s
all
for
