overview
of
requirement_1
over
the
past
few
year
you
must
have
hear
the
term
“big_data”
which
be
define
in
different
way
requirement_1
describe
the
large
volume
of
connector_data_1
in
a
pattern_1
and
pattern_2
manner
the
connector_data_1
belong
to
a
different
organization
and
each
organization
us
such
connector_data_1
for
different
purpose
so
a
large
amount
of
connector_data_1
be
not
critical
the
rather
critical
part
be
how
organization
be
use
this
connector_data_1
requirement_1
be
a
connector_data_1
set
that
be
huge
and
complex
so
that
traditional
connector_data_1
component_3
component_4
be
inadequate
to
deal
with
them
there
be
challenge
to
manage
such
a
huge
volume
of
connector_data_1
such
a
capture
component_5
connector_data_1
analysis
connector_data_1
transfer
connector_data_1
connector_1
etc
requirement_1
follow
the
3v
component_6
a
“high
volume”
“high
velocity”
and
“high
variety”
the
importance
of
requirement_1
be
not
about
how
much
volume
of
connector_data_1
be
present
rather
it
be
focus
on
what
you
do
with
that
connector_data_1
in
today’s
world
by
connector_2
connector_data_1
you
can
find
answer
for
–
root
cause
for
failure
recalculate
the
risk
profile
etc
it
also
help
to
reduce
cost
fast
decision
make
technology_6
technology_7
and
requirement_3
base
requirement_4
help
requirement_5
analyze
the
connector_data_2
or
connector_data_1
immediately
so
decision

be
