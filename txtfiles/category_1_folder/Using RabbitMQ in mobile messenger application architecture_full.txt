component_3
architecture
requirement_1
messenger
have
become
very
popular
recently
at
the
moment
there
be
plenty
of
requirement_1
messenger
such
a
viber
whatsapp
or
telegram
each
have
it
pro
and
con
certainly
in
order
to
take
a
high
place
among
popular
messenger
an
component_1
must
not
only
have
a
perfect
design
and
quality_attribute_1
requirement_2
but
also
be
easily
quality_attribute_2
and
able
to
support
heavy
load
with
the
increase
of
component_4
base
connector_1
such
requirement_3
be
a
real
challenge
since
it
require
not
only
a
lot
of
time
for
development
and
test
and
high
qualification
of
developer
but
also
requirement_4
with
quality_attribute_1
component_5
for
connector_data_2
delivery
in
our
requirement_5
the
best
way
be
to
use
an
open
component_6
connector_data_2
pattern_1
technology_1
which
support
different
technology_2
of
connector_data_2
delivery
and
have
plenty
of
component_7
technology_3
allow
to
quality_attribute_3
it
with
popular
requirement_1
component_5
technology_4
io
this
solution
allow
u
to
pay
more
attention
to
architecture
and
requirement_6
component_8
development
and
ensure
quality_attribute_4
work
of
connector_data_3
delivery
and
easy
quality_attribute_5
accord
to
technology_1
it
allow
easy
implementation
of
the
follow
–
group
chat
–
connector_data_2
delivery
connector_2
–
connector_3
a
connector_data_2
from
the
component_4
while
offline
–
connector_3
a
connector_data_2
on
all
component_7
component_2
at
the
same
time
io
technology_4
–
prevent
unnecessary
connector_data_3
connector_4
a
well
a

delivery
optimization
in
requirement_5
of
disconnection
from
technology_1
e
g
during
internet
cut
off
at
the
same
time
the
development
component_9
always
have
some
challenge
for
example
during
the
development
component_9
our
team
have
to
connector_5
connector_6
of
technology_1
with
the
component_10
side
a
well
a
connector_6
with
an
technology_4
component_1
use
technology_5
technology_2
at
first
we
be
plan
to
use
technology_5
technology_6
wrapper
for
librabbitmq
technology_7
technology_3
for
io
but
it
turn
out
to
have
lot
of
latent
problem
and
bug
–
this
problem
be
solve
by
replace
technology_5
technology_2
with
technology_8
one
should
note
that
we
didn’t
have
such
difficulty
with
the
component_7
technology_3
on
technology_4
also
we
have
a
challenge
of
correct
connector_data_2
delivery
configuration
which
require
the
right
choice
of
quality
of
component_11
qos
a
a
connector_data_4
we
develop
a
quality_attribute_1
component_12
support
heavy
load
and
their
increase
due
to
the
expansion
of
the
component_4
base
and
component_4
activity
peak
use
technology_1
in
connector_data_2
component_1
architecture
help
to
solve
the
problem
of
connector_data_2
delivery
with
the
support
of
multi
component_4
conversation
and
component_13
with
several
component_14
switch
on
at
the
same
time
with
connector_7
a
minimum
of

the
component_10

thus
technology_1
connector_data_2
pattern_1
be
an

development

implementation
of
many
other
connector_data_5
