this
entry
explain
how
to
quality_attribute_1
streamsets
connector_data_1
collector
component_3
to
handle
massive
connector_data_2
quality_attribute_2
with
technology_1
and
streamsets
a
recently
present
in
the
webinar
five
way
to
quality_attribute_1
technology_1
the
quality_attribute_2
challenge
any
connector_data_1
pipeline
run
in
streamsets
connector_data_1
collector
component_3
have
a
maximum
quality_attribute_2
capacity
in
connector_data_3
per
unit
time
each
connector_data_2
or
pattern_2
of
connector_data_2
take
some
amount
of
time
to
be
component_4
in
the
pipeline
–
long
time
to
component_4
imply
lower
connector_data_2
quality_attribute_2
above
the
maximum
quality_attribute_2
capacity
the
pipeline
cannot
keep
up
with
the
flow
of
incoming
connector_data_2
and
back
pressure
be
apply
in
the
form
of
connector_data_3
buffer
in
the
technology_1
topic
in
the
short
term
this
be
not
necessarily
a
problem
–
if
the
flow
of
connector_data_3
into
the
technology_1
topic
fall
over
time
then
the
pipeline
will
be
able
to
catch
up
where
old
pattern_3
technology_4
struggle
to
manage
back
pressure
kafka’s
quality_attribute_3
persistent
storage
have
make
it
a
fixture
in
many
connector_data_1
architecture
if
the
pipeline’s
quality_attribute_2
fall
below
the
connector_data_2
arrival
rate
indefinitely
then
connector_data_3
will
be
buffer
in
technology_1
for
increasing
amount
of
time
increasing
quality_attribute_4
the
amount
of
time
require
for
a
connector_data_2
to
reach
it
eventual
recipient
and
ultimately
overflow
kafka’s
storage
if
the
connector_data_2
arrival
rate
be
more
than
a
single
pipeline
can
handle
how
do
we
quality_attribute_1
the
pipeline
to
handle
more
quality_attribute_2
there
be
a
variety
of
direction
we
can
take
quality_attribute_1
technology_1
vertically
–
quality_attribute_5
a
big
component_5
the
quality_attribute_6
but
often
least
cost
quality_attribute_7
option
be
to
simply
run
connector_data_1
collector
on
a
more
powerful
component_6
you
can
enable
concurrent
connector_data_2
consumption
in
technology_1
by
partitioning
the
technology_1
topic
connector_data_1
collector’s
technology_1
multitopic
component_7
origin
can
then
take
advantage
of
additional
processor
and
memory
to
run
several
component_7
component_8
in
parallel
technology_1
will
quality_attribute_8
connector_data_3
across
the
component_9
and
the
load
will
be
connector_6
between
the
component_7
component_10
note
that
the
number
of
component_9
and
the
number
of
component_11
do
not
have
to
be
equal
if
the
number
of
component_11
be
le
than
the
number
of
component_9
then
technology_1
will
automatically
assign
multiple
component_9
to
one
or
more
component_7
if
there
be
more
component_11
than
component_9
on
the
other
hand
then
some
component_11
will
sit
idle
there
be
a
couple
of
drawback
with
vertical
quality_attribute_1
one
be
that
to
maximize
quality_attribute_2
you
have
to
size
the
component_6
for
the
maximum
expect
load
even
though
the
average
load
be
much
le
than
the
peak
in
other
word
your
expensive
big
component_5
could
be
mostly
idle
much
of
the
time
another
drawback
be
that
with
a
single
large
component_6
there
be
no
fault
tolerance
if
the
component_6
go
down
connector_data_1
stop
flow
quality_attribute_1
technology_1
horizontally
–
quality_attribute_5
more
component_12
a
more
quality_attribute_9
and
usually
more
cost
quality_attribute_7
strategy
be
horizontal
quality_attribute_1
again
partitioning
the
technology_1
topic
but
this
time
run
the
pipeline
on
multiple
connector_data_1
collector
instance
to
quality_attribute_1
technology_1
horizontally
there
be
a
few
option
here
quality_attribute_10
on
the
resource
you
have
quality_attribute_11
all
of
these
option
allow
quality_attribute_12
with
elasticity
–
the
quality_attribute_13
to
and
remove
capacity
a
requirement
connector_1
over
time
–
and
can
provide
fault
tolerance
manually
run
multiple
connector_data_1
collector
you
can
manually
run
the
same
pipeline
on
several
connector_data_1
collector
you
will
need
to
manually
export
the
pipeline
definition
from
the
‘design’
connector_data_1
collector
instance
and
it
into
each
‘execution’
instance
since
all
of
the
pipeline
be
configure
with
the
same
component_7
group
technology_1
will
assign
component_9
to
component_7
a
in
requirement_8
above
this
approach
be
straightforward
but
rely
on
the
operator
to
quality_attribute_8
pipeline
to
the
connector_data_1
collector
instance
and
manually
start
and
stop
connector_data_1
collector
instance
a
require
if
a
single
connector_data_1
collector
instance
go
down
technology_1
will
automatically
assign
it
component_9
to
a
remain
instance
connector_data_1
keep
flow
albeit
at
a
slow
rate
since
few
component_4
resource
be
quality_attribute_11
when
the
operator
start
the
pipeline
on
connector_data_1
collector
instance
technology_1
will
rebalance
the
component_9
across
the
component_7
streamsets
enable
connector_data_1
engineer
to
build
end
to
end
smart
connector_data_1
pipeline
spend
your
time
build
enabling
and
innovate
instead
of
maintain
rewrite
and
fix
run
the
pipeline
in
cluster
connector_7
mode
if
you
be
run
a
technology_5
or
mesos
cluster
you
can
take
advantage
of
connector_data_1
collector’s
cluster
connector_7
mode
configure
the
pipeline’s
connector_8
mode
a
‘cluster
technology_5
streaming’
or
‘cluster
mesos
streaming’
select
a
quality_attribute_14
technology_1
origin
and
connector_data_1
collector
will
submit
the
pipeline
a
a
cluster
component_13
connector_data_4
a
many
technology_6
a
there
be
component_9
in
the
technology_1
topic
this
be
a
fairly
quality_attribute_6
way
to
quality_attribute_1
technology_1
the
advantage
here
be
that
connector_data_1
collector
and
the
cluster
component_1
be
manage
quality_attribute_12
for
you
you
don’t
need
to
manually
copy
the
pipeline
definition
between
connector_data_1
collector
instance
and
if
the
number
of
component_9
connector_1
you
can
simply
restart
the
pipeline
to
take
account
of
the
connector_1
with
minimal
component_14
interruption
and
of
no
loss
of
connector_data_1
similarly
technology_5
take
care
of
restart
connector_data_1
collector
in
requirement_8
of
a
technology_6
failure
use
streamsets
control
hub
to
start
multiple
pipeline
instance
what
can
you
do
if
you
don’t
want
to
manually
manage
connector_data_1
collector
instance
but
you
don’t
have
a
technology_5
or
mesos
cluster
streamsets
control
hub
allow
you
to
manage
connector_data_1
collector
instance
and
pipeline
from
a
single
component_15
a
control
hub
associate
a
pipeline
with
one
or
more
label
and
you
specify
a
maximum
number
of
connector_data_1
collector
instance
to
run
the
when
you
start
the
control
hub
run
the
pipeline
on
connector_data_1
collector
instance
with
a
correspond
label
up
to
the
maximum
number
that
you
specify
control
hub
continuously
pattern_4
the
connector_data_1
collector
instance
so
if
one
go
offline
it
will
automatically
assign
the
pipeline
to
another
instance
with
a
match
label
control
hub
provide
similar
automation
to
cluster
connector_7
mode
but
you
do
have
to
have
a
pool
of
connector_data_1
collector
instance
ready
to
run
pipeline
control
hub
will
also
pattern_4
the
connector_data_1
collector
instance
if
one
go
down
and
failover
be
configure
for
the
the
pipeline
will
be
assign
to
another
instance
accord
to
the
label
use
streamsets
control
hub
with
technology_7
to
start
multiple
connector_data_1
collector
container
on
demand
if
you
have
a
technology_7
cluster
you
can
use
control
hub’s
technology_7
control
agent
to
spin
up
connector_data_1
collector
container
on
demand
technology_7
offer
a
more
modern
quality_attribute_9
cluster
environment
than
technology_5
or
mesos
and
can
be
quality_attribute_5
in
your
connector_data_1
center
or
via
a
requirement_5
technology_8
such
a
technology_7
component_3
or

you
can
customize
the

for
your

requirement
for
example
you
might
need
to
modify
the
connector_data_1
collector
configuration
install
external
technology_11
or
custom

technology_11
use
technology_10
to

then

also
register

although
this

sound
complex
once

leverage
