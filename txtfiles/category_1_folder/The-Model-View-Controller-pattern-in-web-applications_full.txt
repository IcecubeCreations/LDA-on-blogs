the

for

people
have
seek
way
to
separate

from

quality_attribute_1
manner
from
quality_attribute_1
science
and
component_3
from
component_4
component_5
the
component_1
pattern_1
pattern_2
mvc
design
pattern_3
be
a
way
of
separate
the
component_3

from
the
substance
of
the
component_4
in
recent
year
pattern_4
have
become
a
popular
strategy
for
build

there
be
now
web
mvc
technology_1
quality_attribute_2
for
many
programming
technology_2
for
instance
technology_3
for
technology_4
maypole
for
technology_5
and
technology_6
for
technology_7
this
introduce
the
pattern_4
pattern_3
and
it
use
in
web
development
i
will
mention
some
technology_5

but
most
of
it
will
be
applicable
to
any
technology_2
support
connector_data_1
orient
programming
apology
pattern_4
be
usually
connector_1
in
an
connector_data_1
orient
style
so
i’ll
mention
connector_data_1
etc
here
this
text
might
not
make
very
much
sense
without
some
experience
in
oo
programming
and
web
development
connector_data_2
about
all
the
pattern_3
mention
here
can
be
find
at
the
c2
wiki
technology_8
c2
technology_9
technology_10
wiki
since
pattern_4
be
originally
invent
for
traditional
gui
component_4
certain
detail
in
original
pattern_4
pattern_3
don’t
connector_data_3
well
to
web
component_4
l
note
1|note

since
i’m
describe
pattern_4
for
the
web
i
will
simplify
connector_2
misrepresent
and
ignore
those
detail
here
so
what
the
heck
be
it
the
idea
of
the
pattern_4
pattern_3
be
to
divide
an
component_4
into

part
the
component_1
pattern_1
and
pattern_2
let’s
take
a
look
at
each
of
them
component_1
the
component_1
handle
the
state
of
the
component_4
the
state
be
what
your
component_4
be
about
if
your
component_4
be
a
forum
your
component_1
might
contain

dbi
connector_data_4
represent
component_6
component_7
and

the
component_1
do
not
anything
about
technology_11
or
web
component_8
or
anything
that
it
supply
way
to
query
the
state
and
way
to
connector_2
that
state
pattern_1
the
pattern_1
be
the
representation
of
the
component_3

usually
there
be
many
possibly
nest
pattern_1
in
a
single
component_4
a
pattern_1
can
query
the
component_1
but
it
be
not
suppose
to
connector_2
the
state
in
web
base
pattern_4
component_9
a
pattern_1
can
be
connector_1
use
a
template
that
render
an
technology_11
component_10
in
our
hypothetical
forum
component_4
the
pattern_1
would
be
the
template
for
render
a
full
component_6
the
login
component_10
the

component_10
etc
pattern_2
component_3
action
on
the
pattern_1
be
connector_3
to
the
pattern_2
in
a
web
environment
this
be
usually
do
by
have
the
pattern_2
handle
the
incoming
technology_8
connector_data_5
the
pattern_2
connector_4
component_3
connector_data_5
and
pattern_5
them
into
action
that
the
component_1
should
take
then
it
select
the
appropriate
pattern_1
to
handle
the
connector_5
it
be
possible
to
have
more
than
one
pattern_2
but
most
web
component_4
technology_1
i’ve
use
assume
you
only
have
one
example
a
technology_8
connector_data_5
figure

a
sequence
diagram
of
a
single
connector_data_5
connector_5

notice
that
the
pattern_2
do
not
handle
the
connector_6
between
the
pattern_1
and
the
component_1
the
pattern_1
make
direct
connector_data_6
to
the
component_1
what’s
so
useful
about
it
separation
of
connector_data_6
and
component_10
since
the
pattern_2
be
in
charge
of
handle
the
connector_data_6
and
select
an
appropriate
component_10
pattern_1
there
be
no
immediate
couple
between
the
connector_data_5
make
by
the
component_3
and
the
connector_data_7
component_10
this
turn
out
to
be
very
useful
if
the
component_10
flow
in
the
component_4
be
complex
but
even
for
quality_attribute_3
component_2
the
pattern_2
be
a
quality_attribute_1
place
to
handle
common
action
pattern_6
and
component_11
requirement_1
can
be
handle
in
the
pattern_2
for
instance
pattern_1
be
dumb
since
all
that
do
anything
except
build
a
nice
component_10
for
the
component_3
be
outside
the
pattern_1
connector_data_1
connector_2
the
layout
do
not
involve
touch
the
component_5
of
the
component_4
since
the
part
of
the
component_4
that
connector_7
the
most
during
and
after
development
be
the
layout
this
mean
much
le
chance
of

bug
shielding
of
the
component_1
implementation
since
all
action
on
the
component_4
state
be
handle
by
the
component_1
it
be
possible
to
connector_2
the
model’s
implementation
without
touch
the
component_3

a
long
a
the
model’s
component_12
doesn’t
connector_2
but
see
l
couple
between
pattern_1
and
model|coupling
between
pattern_1
and
component_1
problem
and
limitation
what
go
where
sometimes
be
hard
to
figure
out
where
a
specific
piece
of
the
component_4
be
suppose
to
go
especially
divide
the
component_1
from
the
pattern_2
can
be
hard
a
a
rule
of
thumb
the
pattern_2
should
be
a
minimal
a
possible
it
be
only
responsible
for
pattern_5
technology_8
connector_data_6
into
component_1
action
and
select
the
right
pattern_1
the
component_1
should
provide
all
the
behavior
it
can
without
handle
the
technology_8
connector_data_6
or
output
technology_12
detail
couple
between
pattern_1
and
component_1
one
problem
with
have
the
pattern_1
and
pattern_2
query
the
component_1
be
that
connector_2
the
model’s
component_12
mean
you
also
have
to
adapt
the
pattern_2
and
pattern_1
that
act
on
it
l
note
2|note

adapt
the
pattern_2
be
usually
not
too
much
work
but
connector_2
a
large
number
of
pattern_1
will
be
annoying
the
component_1
component_1
pattern_1
pattern_2
pattern_3
try
to
minimize
the
impact
of
these
connector_7
by
use
two
component_1
a
domain
component_1
and
an
component_4
component_1
the
pattern_1
only
connector_8
the
component_4
component_1
and
the
component_4
component_1
can
query
the
domain
component_1
the
component_4
component_1
usually
partly
generate
by
the
gui
design
technology_13
i
haven’t
use
this
pattern_3
at
all
so
i
don’t
how
useful
it
be
for
web
component_2
lot
of
connector_data_4
create
an
pattern_4
component_4
can
connector_data_7
in
more
and
connector_data_4
than
a
“page
based”
component_9
that
mean
more
design
up
front
on
the
other
hand
a
well
design
pattern_4
component_9
will
be
easy
to
adapt
and
expand
because
the
will
be
separate
quality_attribute_1
should
i
use
it
possibly
i
think
that
any
web
base
component_4
that
us
more
than
a
handful
of
template
or
have
a
complex
connector_9
between
component_10
would
be
a
quality_attribute_1
candidate
for
the
pattern_4
pattern_3
there
be
alternative
of

see

resource
alternatives|resources__alternatives
quality_attribute_2
technology_1
for
technology_5
note
there
be
more

these
be
two
example
i
pick
because
they

have

be
a
relatively
quality_attribute_3
that
provide
a
quality_attribute_1
base

for
a
pattern_2
it’s
easy
to
understand
and
it
have
some
convenient
technology_11
template
support
though
it
doesn’t
force
you
to
use
technology_11
template
if
you
another

you
derive
your
pattern_2
from
the
technology_10
component_4

handle
component_3
connector_data_6
via
the
run_modes
component_9
and
you
can
use
a
templating
component_9
to
connector_1
the
pattern_1
how
you
connector_1
your
component_1
be
entirely
up
to
you
imo
this
be
a
quality_attribute_1
thing
the
component_1
be
the
most
specific
thing
in
an
component_4
and
a
technology_1

not
