at

component_11
requirement_4
tend

prefer

when
they
need
to
run
connector_3
component_7
on
top
of
these
technology_3
pattern_2
connector_data_1
connector_3
what
exactly
constitute
real

there
be
considerable
debate
over
what
real

mean
for
these
connector_data_1
component_6
real

be
requirement_5
time
forrester
analyst
mike
gualtieri
say
in
financial
requirement_7
for
example
real

have
requirement
on
the
order
of
millisecond
or
microsecond
most
requirement_5
component_8
however
work
fine
when
real

connector_data_4
can
be
connector_5
in
a
few
second
or
even
a
few
minute
these
window
be
still
much
small
than
pattern_3
orient
requirement_10
that
require
hour

connector_data_5
technology_2

technology_2
connector_3
a
connector_3
requirement_10
component_12
directly
quality_attribute_5
into
the

technology_2
component_6
have
become
the
most
popular
open_source
real

connector_1
requirement_10
component_6
say
mike
gualtieri
an
analyst
at
forrester
research
an
early
version
of
technology_2
connector_1
use
a
microbatch
component_7
to
connector_8
connector_1
component_7
this
connector_8
pattern_3
quickly
a
a
sort
of
connector_1
technology_15
but
have
some
requirement_11
challenge
a
a
connector_data_5
the
technology_2
which
continue
to
grow
have
reimplemented
technology_2
connector_1
to
provide
quality_attribute_6
requirement_11
and
lower
quality_attribute_4
beyond
exactly
once
component_7
connector_2
to
all
component_13
of

support
the

of
connector_1
connector_data_1
with
historical
connector_data_1
flink
have
technical
respect
despite
be

than
technology_2
connector_3
flink
be
to
be
much
more
real

than
technology_2
gualtieri
say
flink
also
connector_9
technology_14
technology_16
which
contribute
to
for

component_7
flink
have
a
much
small
but
it

accord
to
gualtieri
flink
have
some
prospect
a
the
chief
competitor
to
technology_2
in
the
open_source
world
gualtieri
say
michael

the
flink
have
also
be
make

on
connector_1
technology_17
which
help
requirement_5
analyst
build

greatly
expand

technology_3
connector_10
be
one
of
the
lead
real

connector_data_1
connector_1
component_1
and
be
a
great
technology_1
to
use
either
a
a

connector_data_6
bus

to
handle
peak
connector_data_1
ingestion
load
something

say
tal
doron
director

innovation
at

an

computing
component_6
however
it
also
introduce
additional
quality_attribute_4
in

scenario
since
it

another
component_16
in
the
workflow
and
have

provide
high
quality_attribute_9
and
no

technology_3

for
quality_attribute_5
pattern_4
together
and

technology_3
often
connector_11
connector_data_1

technology_2
or
flink
to
be
analyze
ross
garrett
for

requirement_14
element
an
component_18
requirement_2
component_6
have
adopt
technology_3
connector_10
a
a
component_12
mesh
in
it
migration
from
a
monolithic
component_8
to
pattern_4
ross
garrett
vice
president
of
technology_18
at
requirement_14
element
say
that
technology_3
stand
out
a
the
best
option
for
this
migration
in
many
requirement_9
connector_data_7
connector_12
pattern_6
be
not
the
most
quality_attribute_10
way
for
connector_13
between
pattern_4
since
they
create
couple
and
connector_14
that
be
counter
to
the
objective
of
a
true
pattern_4
architecture
instead
an
orient
pattern_6
remove
the
connector_14
create
by
direct
component_12
connector_data_8
technology_3
connector_10
be
an
ideal
solution
to
manage
these
connector_3
garrett
say
garrett
that
the
technology_3
connector_10
component_18
be
incredibly
lightweight
make
connector_3
component_7
quality_attribute_1
a
an
component_8
programming
component_19
to
each
pattern_7
individually
while
lean
on
the
benefit
from
technology_3
s
core
competency
around
quality_attribute_11
and
fault
tolerance
use
technology_3
a
an

attunity
s
petrie

team
need
to
weigh
the
advantage
of
specialization
against
the

and
additional

it
create
most
requirement_4
that
