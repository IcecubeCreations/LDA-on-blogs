how
fast
can
you
requirement_1
technology_1
technology_3
have
become
the
de
facto
technology_6
exchange
technology_7
on
the
web
today
a
technology_3
document
be
quite
quality_attribute_2
and
be
akin
to
a
simplify
form
of
technology_8
{
image
{
width

height

animate
false
coding_keyword_4




}
}
these
document
need
to
be
generate
and
requirement_1
on
a
large
quality_attribute_3
thankfully
we
have
many
fast
technology_9
to
requirement_1
and
manipulate
technology_3
document
in
a
recent
paper
by
mison
a
fast
technology_3
requirement_4
for
connector_data_1
requirement_5
the
researcher
report
requirement_1
technology_3
document
at


or


gb
s
with
common
technology_9
such
a
rapidjson
it
be
hard
to
tell
the
exact
number
a
you
need
to
connector_5
a
tiny
plot
but
i
have
the
right
ballpark
they
use
a


ghz
processor
so
that’s

to

cycle
per
input
byte
of
connector_data_1
do
it
make
sense
i
don’t
have
much
experience
component_3
lot
of
technology_1
but
i
can
use
a
technology_9
rapidjson
be
handy
enough
if
you
have
a
technology_3
document
in
a
memory
buffer
all
you
need
be
a
few
line
rapidjson
document
technology_10
if
technology_10
parseinsitu
buffer
hasparseerror
{
you
be
do
requirement_1
}
this
“parseinsitu”
approach
modify
the
input
buffer
for
fast
handle
of
the
coding_keyword_3
but
be
fast
if
you
have
a
buffer
that
you
do
not
want
to
modify
you
can
connector_data_2
“parse”
instead
to
run
an
example
i
be
requirement_1
one
sizeable
“twitter
json”
test
document
i
be
use
a
linux
component_4
with
a
skylake
processor
i
requirement_1
the
document

time
and
connector_6
that
the
minimum
and
the
average
time
be
close
parseinsitu
requirement_1


cycle
byte


cycle
byte
this
be
the
time
need
to
requirement_1
the
whole
document
into
a
component_5
you
can
connector_7
even
quality_attribute_1
requirement_2
if
you
use
the
connector_8
component_6
that
rapidjson
provide
though
i
admit
that
my
number
be
preliminary
and
partial
they
suggest
to
me
that
researcher
might
not
have
give
rapidjson
all
it
chance
since
their
number
be
close
to
the
“parse”
which
be
slow
it
be
possible
that
they
do
not
consider
it
acceptable
that
the
input
buffer
be
modify
but
i
cannot
find
any
documentation
to
this
effect
nor
any
relate
rationale
give
that
they
do
not
provide
their

it
be
hard
to
tell
what
they
do
exactly
with
rapidjson
the
researcher
report
connector_data_3
roughly
10x
quality_attribute_1
than
rapidjson
equivalent
to
a
fraction
of
a
cycle
per
input
byte
the
caveat
be
that
they
only
selectively
requirement_1
the
document
extract
only
subcomponents
of
the
document
a
far
a
i
can
tell
their
be
not
freely
quality_attribute_4
how
would
they
fare
against
an
optimize
component_7
of
the
rapidjson
technology_9
i
be
not
sure
at
a
glance
it
do
not
seem
implausible
that
they
might
have
underestimate
the
quality_attribute_5
of
rapidjson
by
a
factor
of
two
in
their
paper
the
technology_11
base
technology_3
technology_9
technology_12
and
technology_13
be
fast
often
fast
than
rapidjson
even
if
rapidjson
be
connector_4
in
technology_14
be
that
fair
i
be
not
in
principle
surprise
that
technology_11
can
be
fast
than
technology_14
and
i
be
not
very
familiar
with
rapidjson…
but
it
look
requirement_2
orient
technology_14
technology_14
be
not
always
fast
than
technology_11
but
in
the
hand
of
the
right
people
i
expect
it
to
do
well
so
i
go
look
for
a
quality_attribute_6
requirement_2
benchmark
that
include
both
technology_14
and
technology_11
technology_3
technology_9
and
find
nothing
be
fail
me
in
any
requirement_6
to
answer
my
own
question
it
seem
that
requirement_1
technology_3
should
take
about

cycle
per
input
byte
on
a
recent
intel
processor
maybe
le
if
you
be
clever
so
you
should
expect
to
spend

or

second
requirement_1
one
gigabyte
of
technology_3
connector_data_1

make

geoff

be
another
question
open
to
debate
should
the
cost
of
requirement_1
include
validation
be
it
reasonable
to
quietly
coding_keyword_5
“reasonable’
connector_data_3
of
a
query
on
something
that
isn’t
valid
technology_1
this
be
a
query
that
affect
mison
more
a
far
a
i
can
tell
mison’s
ability
to
skip
might
allow
it
to
pass

syntax
error
without

they
didn’t

so

unfortunately
that

jan
say


at


be
it
do
make
a
lot
of
sense
do
it
look
they
claim

cycle
per
byte
and
you
think
it
be

you
be
right
benchmarking
be
hard
but
take
a
look
at
the
abstract
–
10x
improvement
for
“analytical”
“fsm”
and
probably
some
simd
analytical
dom
style
requirement_4
will
always
loose
connector_12

out
of

per
component_9
i
would
expect
connector_8
requirement_4
to
do
2x+
quality_attribute_1
no
allocation
copy
or
requirement_1
digit
into
number
nobody
will
use
how
be
connector_8
requirement_4
connector_13
which
one
be
not
a
loop
connector_12
character
by
character
byte
by
byte
can
any
compiler
vectorize
that
and
remove
branch
modern
regexp
technology_9

hyperscan
show
great
connector_data_3
with
vectorized
fsm
i
believe
such
technique
would
quality_attribute_5
up
analytical
query
over
technology_1
scan
for

byte
out
of

byte
component_9
do
it
matter
technology_1
be
de
facto
technology_6
technology_7
for
connector_data_1
exchange
between
requirement_8
these
day
many
open
datasets
and
about
every
startup
use
technology_1
extensively
so
yeah
if
someone

spend
the
time
do
it
please
open_source
it
i
would
greatly
appreciate
have
it
in
technology_23
btw
no
you
will
not
connector_7
10x
in
practice
nobody
do
technology_1
everybody
do
technology_1
gz
but
gzip
be
very
slow
thanks
to
amdahl’s
law
you
will
connector_7
only
2x
improvement
with
vectorized
fsm
technology_1
requirement_4
gunzip
will
take
90%
cpu
then

great
pointer
it’s
fast
and
coding_keyword_8
only
thanks
a
lot
regard
technology_11
vs
technology_14
they
be
pretty
close
in
the
land
of
the
search
component_10
we
see
more
carefully
connector_13
technology_11
component_11
beat
technology_14
implementation
we
all
technology_24
be
very
fast
and
hard
to
beat
there
be
another
example
galago
be
a
technology_11
re
implementation
of
indri
so
it
us
a
similar
query
evaluation
paradigm
but
it
be
nevertheless
about
2x
fast
