this
we
will
in
brief
about
various
component_1
that
be
require
in
build
a
quality_attribute_1
micro
component_4
component_5
before
understand
each
architectural
component_6
in
brief
we
will
state
general
connector_1
that
come
up
while
design
micro
component_4
architecture
micro
component_4
architecture
componentswhenever
we
be
create
a
micro
component_4
component_5
the
follow
question
come
to
our
mindhow
will
we
register
micro
component_4
so
that
component_7
can
use
that
registration
connector_data_2
component_2
discovery
and
connector_data_3
in
a
micro
component_2
how
will
we
ensure
that
micro
component_4
component_5
which
be
build
be
completely
fault
tolerant
and
highly
quality_attribute_4
how
will
we
make
sure
that
there
be
a
single
give
to
the
component_8
which
reduce
a
lot
of
component_8
side
effort
and
make
that
micro
component_4
component_5
very
easy
to
use
how
to
load
balance
incoming
connector_data_4
to
micro
component_4
seamlessly
please
see
architectural
diagram
below
and
understand
whether
component_1
involve
in
build
the
architecture
solve
all
of
the
question
state
above

provide
a

to
the
outside
for
connector_2
with
it

also

another

component_8
through
which
it
alternately
connector_4
with

for

component_8
also
come
with
inbuilt

act
a
a

component_3
which
be
use
to
avoid
complete
failure
of
component_5
it
do
this
by
provide
a
kind
of
circuit
breaker
mechanism
in
which
a
circuit
remain
close
when
component_5
be
run
smoothly
without
any
issue
if
there
be
error
continuously
encounter
in
the
component_5
then
hystrix
component_9
circuit
open
and
any
further
connector_data_4
to
a
connector_5
component_2
be
stop
by
hystrix
and
instead
connector_data_4
be
divert
to
a
fall
back
component_2
in
this
way
it
provide
a
highly
