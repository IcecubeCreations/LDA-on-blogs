trulia
design
and
build
a
real
time
technology_1
component_1
with
technology_2
technology_3
trulia
need
a
way
to
track
connector_data_1
in
real
time
that
would
be
fast
to
develop
and
technology_2
technology_3
be
the
perfect
solution
previously
we
connector_1
a
high
level
overview
of
our
personalization
hub
and
how
we
use
lambda
architecture
at
trulia
an
important
part
of
both
personalization
and
lambda
architecture
be
real
time
track
historically
we
use
a
track
pixel
which
would
be
ingest
and
component_2
with
a
daily
pattern_1
cycle
make
this
connector_data_1
quality_attribute_1
once
a
day
many
hour
after
an
have
occur
however
to
understand
a
user’s
behavior
in
real
time
we
need
to
component_3
in
real
time
and
the
pattern_1
delay
would
be
unacceptable
for
our
component_1
additionally
in
order
to
connector_2
in
real
time
it
require
collaboration
with
many
different
team
within
our
organization
which
would
also
take
more
time
thus
in
order
to
understand
a
user’s
behavior
in
real
time
we
need
to
bootstrap
into
our
personalization
hub
and
do
so
in
real
time
track
component_4
connector_data_1
be
one
of
the
many
important
part
in
build
a
personalization
component_1
the
more
we
about
a
component_4
the
quality_attribute_2
we
can
personalize
content
to
the
component_4
to
that
end
it
be
important
to
think
about
how
we
component_5
component_4
a
we
track
component_4
the
track
pixel
connector_data_1
technology_4
we
historically
use
be
very
different
compare
to
our
technology_5
connector_data_1
component_5
and
we
be
go
to
have
to
apply
a
complex
transformation
on
the
track
pixel
connector_data_1
to
the
technology_4
of
our
master
connector_data_1
set
connector_data_1
governance
be
central
to
our
track
component_1
and
we
would
have
to
apply
strict
connector_data_1
governance
to
our
bootstrapping
of
technology_2
technology_3
would
allow
u
to
both
transform
and
validate
the
track
connector_data_1
and
we
would
be
able
to
do
this
in
real
time
which
be
the
solution
we
need
transform
the
connector_data_1
in
real
time
we
decide
to
use
technology_3
pattern_2
to
perform
the
transformation
of
the
track
pixel
connector_data_1
to
our
technology_5
connector_data_1
component_5
technology_3
pattern_2
allow
technology_3
to
modify
or
drop
in
real
time
we
be
able
to
create
an
pattern_2
that
apply
transformation
pattern_3
by
pattern_3
to
the
tack
pixel
connector_data_1
and
eventually
validate
the
transformation
to
ensure
it
conform
to
our
connector_data_1
component_5
ensure
strict
connector_data_1
governance
if
the
requirement_1
entry
fail
to
transform
or
validate
we
discard
it
by
place
it
in
a
location
in
technology_6
for
invalid
build
a
fail
quality_attribute_3
topology
when
design
the
technology_3
topology
we
have
to
be
considerate
of
several
constraint
we
need
a
topology
that
be
easily
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_5
and
quality_attribute_6
the
topology
need
to
be
fail
quality_attribute_3
at
every
pattern_3
because
of
the
critical
nature
of
track
and
lastly
we
need
the
topology
to
handle
recovery
smoothly
in
the
requirement_2
of
a
failure
our
technology_3
topology
end
up
look
this
technology_3
topology
that
be
easily
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_5
and
fault
tolerant
the
above
topology
be
easily
quality_attribute_4
and
quality_attribute_6
because
we
separate
the
technology_3
agent
into
two
tier
we
be
able
to
install
a
technology_3
agent
on
tier
one
which
have
a
syslog
component_3
and
technology_7
connector_3
this
agent
sit
on
very
important
production
hardware
that
we
do
not
want
to
accidentally
disturb
our
tier
two
house
a
second
technology_3
agent
that
have
an
technology_7
component_3
with
a
technology_8
connector_3
most
importantly
this
be
where
our
pattern_2
sit
a
well
so
that
if
we
need
to
modify
our
pattern_2
component_6
we
can
release
version
of
our
pattern_2
to
tier
two
so
that
we
never
touch
our
tier
one
agent
this
have
be
especially
useful
a
our
tier
one
agent
be
quality_attribute_7
summer
and
we
have
not
need
to
manage
it
additionally
the
overhead
of
do
the
technology_1
be
on
the
second
tier
so
the
more
critical
production
component_7
do
not
use
resource
on
technology_1
finally
this
topology
be
easily
quality_attribute_5
because
we
use
an
haproxy
for
load
balance
we
can
additional
component_7
to
each
tier
and
modify
the
configuration
of
the
haproxy
to
connector_2
and
connector_4
connector_data_1
from
additional
component_8
the
above
topology
be
also
failsafe
at
every
pattern_3
and
amongst
all
of
our
development
and
production
environment
if
the
upstream
component_9
go
down
i
e
technology_8
then
the
downstream
component_9
have
a
failover
mechanism
we
do
this
by
take
advantage
of
flume’s
failover
connector_3
processor
this
allow
u
to
specify
where
to
direct
in
the
requirement_2
of
failover
for
example
if
technology_8
be
to
go
down
then
technology_3
tier
two
would
go
down
cause
technology_3
tier
one
to
connector_4
to
technology_6
our
technology_3
tier
two
agent
have
an
additional
netcat
component_3
which
we
can
use
to
replay
from
technology_6
into
technology_9
we
design
the
replay
component_10
to
be
do
offline
rather
than
online
to
prevent
additional
strain
on
the
component_1
design
and
build
this
component_1
be
a
reward
experience
this
component_1
have
allow
trulia
to
bootstrap
over
billion
in
real
time
while
maintain
our
strict
connector_data_1
governance
and
have
remain
exceptionally
quality_attribute_8
since
be
quality_attribute_7
more
than
a
year
ago
