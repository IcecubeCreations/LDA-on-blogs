loose

be

it

that

one
of
the
most
important
idea
in
the
world
of
engineering
be
the
concept
of
loose
couple
in
a
loosely
couple
design
component_3
be
independent
and
connector_3
in
one
will
not
affect
the
of
others
this
approach
offer
optimal
quality_attribute_2
and
quality_attribute_3
when
component_3
be

replace
or
modify
conversely
a
tightly
couple
design
mean
that
component_3
tend
to
be
interdependent
connector_3
in
a
single
component_4
can
have
a
component_5
wide
impact
with
unanticipated
and
undesirable
effect
the
requirement_7
of
loosely
couple
component_6
be
widely
recognize
in
the
world
but
unfortunately
most
requirement_8
component_7
end
up
be
tightly
couple
to
the
rest
technology_2
component_8
that
they
use
each
component_9
side
technology_2
be
often
develop
for
a
specific
requirement_8
component_10
project
each
custom
component_10
then
require
another
special
purpose
rest
technology_2
in
other
word
the
component_10
and
the
component_11
end
up
be
tightly
couple
to
one
another
develop
a
rest
technology_2
for
every
project
lead
to
backend
complexity
over
time
a
requirement_9
can
end
up
with
infrastructure
that
be
not
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_5
quality_attribute_6
or
quality_attribute_7
i
have
connector_4
about
the
problem
of
develop
rest
apis
for
every
project
elsewhere
but
now
i
think
this
warn
should
be
even
more
strongly
word
requirement_9
should
never
develop
a
rest
technology_2
for
any
specific
component_10
please
connector_5
that
again
it’s
a
game
changer
you
should
never
develop
a
rest
technology_2
for
any
specific
component_10
this
practice
almost
always
connector_data_1
in
an
component_10
that
be
tightly
couple
to
a
custom
build
component_11
the
best
approach
be
to
build
a
rest
technology_2
component_12
that
can
be
use
and
quality_attribute_8
in
a
quality_attribute_9
manner
for
general
purpose
component_10
development
the
advantage
be
enormous
for
example
developer
don’t
need
to
a
technology_2
to
develop
a
component_10
the
same
apis
can
be
quality_attribute_8
for
many
different
purpose
the
total
number
of
component_8
and
be
consolidate
improve
quality_attribute_1
documentation
component_13
role
and
technology_2
component_8
become
standardize
enhance
corporate
governance
and
compliance
when
a
requirement_8
component_10
be
develop
there
be
usually
a
component_9
side
team
that
build
the
rest
technology_2
and
a
component_14
side
team
that
build
the
component_10
the
connector_6
between
these
two
group
take
lot
of
time
and
money
while
they
converge
on
an

in
fact
gartner
estimate
that
75%
of
the
cost
of
a
requirement_8
project
be
relate
to
backend
requirement_1
and
for
this
reason
the
big
benefit
of
a
loosely
couple
rest
technology_2
architecture
be
that
the
connector_6
between
these
two
team
be
minimize
this
be
where
the
concept
of
a
loosely
couple
rest
technology_2
component_12
really
generate
requirement_10
requirement_7
component_3
that
need
to
“know
things”
about
each
other
be
tightly
couple
component_3
that
can
operate
independently
and
have
a
well
define
connector_7
pattern_4
be
loosely
couple
in
the
same
manner
if
your
component_9
side
team
be
deeply
engage
with
your
component_14
side
team
then
they
be
tightly
couple
a
well
these
two
team
can
end
up
spend
lot
of
time
play
an
expensive
game
of
technology_2
pattern_5
pong
instead
of
ship
component_10
a
a
veteran
engineer
i
find
one
aspect
of
this
situation
rather
fascinate
usually
loose
couple
be
a
best
practice
for
connector_data_2
orient
design
if
you
leave
some
tightly
couple
in
the
somewhere
then
the
worst
requirement_11
scenario
be
probably
a
few
snarky

from
one
of
the
other
engineer
over
lunch
but
in
this
situation
there
be
two
distinct
development
team
and
their
connector_6
be
define
by
the
rest
technology_2
they
be
build
bad
design
infect
their
work
relationship
and
this
have
real
world
consequence
in
term
of
time
and
money
a
component_12
approach
to
restful
component_8
connector_3
all
of
this
the
component_9
side
team
focus
on
mobilize
connector_data_3
component_15
connector_8
component_16
component_11
and
administer
role
base
quality_attribute_1
for
the
component_12
the
front
end
team
then
build
anything
they
want
on
their
component_12
of
choice
problem
be
minimize
because
the
developer
automatically
connector_9
the
component_8
that
they
need
but
what
type
of
can
actually
connector_10
a
component_5
this
imagine
that
a
modern
developer
could
requirement_2
into
a
portal
select
the
type
of
component_10
that
they
want
to
build
and
instantly
connector_2
a
comprehensive
palette
of
rest
technology_2
component_8
design
for
that
purpose
and
vet
for
use
by
their
it
department
this
be
a
tangible
roadmap
for
the
modern
requirement_12
to
embrace
loosely
couple
design
and
take
this
vision
to
the
next
level
by
combine
quality_attribute_7
administration
with
agile
component_12
orient
component_10
development
the
dreamfactory
gold
package
provide
this
requirement_13
a
requirement_9
or
component_11
technology_3
can
component_17
and
manage
hundred
or
thousand
of
individual
dreamfactory
instance
each
one
be
a
complete
rest
technology_2
development
component_12
next
the
administrator
can
define
any
number
of
pre
configure
rest
technology_2
package
for
various
purpose
example
might
include
component_8
for
iot
telephony
requirement_8
component_10
connector_data_4
etc
these
package
can
include
third
party
component_8
stripe
or
technology_4
component_16
technology_5
component_11
and
role
base
connector_11
to
any
number
of
technology_6
or
technology_7
component_2
all
a
modern
developer
have
to
do
be
sign
up
select
a
package
and
start
build
the
component_14
component_10
this
be
where
dreamfactory
be
head
for
u
technology_2
automation
mean
instantly
provide
a
comprehensive
component_11
base
environment
for
modern
developer
on
demand
use
requirement_11
include
connector_12
custom
component_8
to
partner
in
a
ready
make
development
environment
and
jump
start
requirement_12
developer
with
pre
load
and
pre
approve
palette
of
technology_2
component_11
this
excite
technology_8
make
the
benefit
of
loosely

rest
technology_2
