connector_2

technology_2
offer
some
powerful
primitive
when
it
come
to

by

you
connector_3
a
that
run
every
time
an

connector_data_2
have
be
connector_4

the

the
proverbial

that

an

by

technology_2
allow
u
to
run
a
whenever
any
connector_data_2
be
connector_6
there
be
no
build
in
pattern_2
base
on
path
technology_2
do
perform
some
basic
requirement_1
—
for
example
requirement_1
the
incoming
technology_3
connector_data_4
and
extract
different
component_4
the
path
coding_keyword_3
pair
encoding
gzip
and
technology_6
etc
however
the
need
for
high
level
requirement_3
mean
that
we
usually
have
to
reach
for
a
web
technology_7
for
example
if
a
multipart
form
connector_data_3
or
component_2
x
www
form
urlencoded
connector_data_2
be
connector_6
we
need
to
use
a
to
handle
decoding
the
content
for
u
if
we
want
to
simply
connector_7
connector_data_5
base
on
pattern_3
match
and
technology_3

we’ll
need
either
a
—
or
often
a
full
web
technology_7
—
to
handle
this
for
u
that’s
where
technology_8
express
j
come
into
play
meet
express
j
express
j
fairly
early
become
the
go
to
technology_7
for
build
web
component_5
use
technology_9
j
it
scratch
an
itch
that
many
developer
have
it
provide
a
nice
syntax
for
connector_8
technology_3
connector_data_2
it
provide
a
standardize
for
build
out
technology_10
and
it
do
so
use
the
familiar
pattern_4
pattern_3
embrace
by
the
core
technology_2
component_6
and
most
of
the
npm
ecosystem
express
j
become
so
popular
that
it’s
almost
ubiquitously
associate
with
technology_2
—
much
when
we
connector_2
about
the
technology_11
technology_12
we’re
already
conjure
up
thought
of
the
technology_7
rail
in
fact
express
j
and
technology_2
be
member
of
the
popular
mean
and
mern
technology_13
acronym
let’s
take
a
look
at
what
our
previous
example
might
look
when
we
bring
express
j
into
the
picture
coding_keyword_2
express
=
require
express
coding_keyword_2
component_7
=
express
component_7
coding_keyword_1
component_3
req
re
=
{
this
be
connector_5
once
the
coding_keyword_3
have
be
connector_4
coding_keyword_5
body
=
req
on
connector_data_3
connector_data_3
=
{
this
be
connector_5
a
chunk
of
body
be
connector_4
body
+=
connector_data_3
}
req
on
end
=
{
this
be
connector_5
once
the
body
have
be
fully
connector_4
coding_keyword_5
requirement_1
try
{
requirement_1
=
technology_5
requirement_1
body
}
catch
e
{
re
statuscode
=

re
technology_5
{
error
cannot_parse
}
}
re
technology_5
{
error
false
username
requirement_1
username
}
}
}
component_7
listen

=
{
console
requirement_2
component_1
run
at
technology_3
localhost

}
in
this
example
we
see
that
thing
connector_3
a
little
nice
we’re
able
to
specifically
state
the
and
path
we
want
to
match
by
use
component_7
coding_keyword_1
component_3
this
be
much
quality_attribute_1
than
connector_9
a
big
branch
statement
within
the
pattern_5
we’re
also
give
some
other
nicety
consider
the
re
technology_5
{}

this
not
only
serialize
an
connector_data_6
into
it
technology_4
equivalent
but
it
also
set
the
appropriate
content
type
coding_keyword_3
for
u
however
express
j
still
give
u
the
same
paradigm
that
we
connector_3
when
use
the
build
in
technology_3

we’re
still
connector_10
on
req
and
re
connector_data_6
for
example
we
make
a
custom
demo
for
no
really
click
here
to
connector_11
it
out
click
here
to
see
the
full
demo
with
requirement_4
connector_data_5
an
ideal
example
let’s
take
a
step
back
and
look
at
what
an
ideal
example
of
an
technology_3
component_1
might
look

connector_8
be
desirable
and
express
j
have
a
powerful
connector_8
syntax
it
support
dynamic
connector_8
pattern_3
for
instance
however
the
that
run
within
the
pattern_6
be
where
we
really
want
to
clean
thing
up
in
the
above
example
we’re
do
a
lot
of
work
with
pattern_7

the
connector_data_2
connector_data_6
be
an
emitter
that
emit
two
we
care
about
namely
connector_data_3
and
end
but
really
we
often
want
the
ability
to
convert
an
technology_3
connector_data_2
into
a
technology_4
connector_data_6
that
we
can
easily
extract
requirement_5
from
also
we’re
give
both
a
connector_data_2
req
and
a
connector_12
re
connector_data_6
the
req
connector_data_6
make
sense
—
it
contain
connector_data_7
about
the
connector_data_2
we’re
connector_6
but
do
the
re
really
make
all
that
much
sense
we
only
want
to
provide
a
connector_data_8
from
our
pattern_6
a
a
connector_data_1
with
pattern_8

it’s
quality_attribute_1
to
connector_6
a
connector_data_8
from
a
connector_data_9
coding_keyword_4
the
requirement_5
we
can
do
the
same
thing
if
we
make
use
of
pattern_9

by
coding_keyword_4
a
connector_data_9
to
an
pattern_9

the
pattern_6
can
resolve
a
requirement_5
that
ultimately
represent
the
connector_12
we
intend
for
the
component_8
to
connector_6
let’s
look
at
an
example
of
this
coding_keyword_2
component_1
=
somecoolframework
component_1
coding_keyword_1
component_3
pattern_9
req
=
{
coding_keyword_5
requirement_1
try
{
requirement_1
=
await
req
requestbodyjson
}
catch
e
{
coding_keyword_4

{
error
cannot_parse
}
}
coding_keyword_4
{
error
false
username
requirement_1
username
}
}
component_1
listen

=
{
console
requirement_2
component_1
run
at
technology_3
localhost

}
there
be
a
few
concept
go
on
in
this
idealize
example
of
ours
first
we’re
maintain
the
exist
pattern_2
syntax
use
by
express
j
because
it’s
pretty
solid
second
our
req
connector_data_6
provide
a
helper
for
convert
an
incoming
connector_data_2
into
technology_5
the
third
feature
be
that
we’re
able
to
provide
a
representation
of
the
connector_12
by
simply
coding_keyword_4
a
connector_data_8
since
technology_14
doesn’t
support
tuples
we’re
essentially
recreate
one
by
use
an
coding_keyword_6
so
with
this
fictional
example
a
coding_keyword_4
coding_keyword_7
could
be
connector_13
directly
to
the
component_9
a
a
body
a
coding_keyword_4
coding_keyword_6
can
be
use
to
represent
the
status
and
the
body
and
perhaps
a
third
parameter
for
metadata
coding_keyword_3
and
a
coding_keyword_4
connector_data_6
can
be
convert
into
it
technology_4
representation
adapt
express
j
now
it
actually
be
possible
to
recreate
some
of
this
behavior
with
express
j
use
a
set
of
technology_10
the
express
pattern_9
pattern_5
npm
provide
a
wrapper
that
can
interpose
and
allow
an
pattern_9
pattern_6
to
connector_14
nicely
with
the
express
j
component_7
use
technology_15
unfortunately
this
require
the
developer
to
manually
wrap
each
pattern_6

coding_keyword_2
asynchandler
=
require
express
pattern_9
pattern_5
component_7
coding_keyword_1
component_3
asynchandler
pattern_9
req
re
next
=
{
coding_keyword_2
bar
=
await
foo
findall
re
connector_15
bar
}
the
connector_12
tuple
unwrap
can
also
be
handle
by
technology_10
such
a
technology_10
would
need
to
run
after
the
pattern_6
have
run
and
would
replace
the
coding_keyword_6
with
a
representation
express
j
be
expect
the
ability
to
promisify
the
connector_data_2
body
connector_16
requirement_1
can
also
be
build
in
a
generic
manner
component_7
use
req
re
next
=
{
req
bodytojson
=
requestbodyjson
req
next
}
requestbodyjson
req
{
coding_keyword_4
promise
resolve
reject
=
{
coding_keyword_5
body
=
req
on
connector_data_3
connector_data_3
=
{
this
be
connector_5
a
chunk
of
body
be
connector_4
body
+=
connector_data_3
}
req
on
end
=
{
this
be
connector_5
once
the
body
have
be
fully
connector_4
coding_keyword_5
requirement_1
try
{
requirement_1
=
technology_5
requirement_1
body
}
catch
e
{
reject
e
coding_keyword_4
}
resolve
requirement_1
}
}
}
with
the
above

we
can
then
await
the
requirement_1
use
express
j
and
really
any
other
situation
where
we’re
give
an
instance
of
an
technology_3
connector_data_2
connector_data_6
when
use
the
express
j
technology_10
coding_keyword_2
requirement_1
=
await
req
bodytojson
use
the
generically
coding_keyword_2
requirement_1
=
await
requestbodyjson
req
use
another
technology_7
it
be
true
that
we
can
reproduce
some
of
these
desire
pattern_3
use
express
j
but
there
be
technology_7
that
have
be
build
from
the
grind
up
with
support
for
promise
and
the
pattern_9
await
paradigm
let’s
see
what
our
example
pattern_6
might
look
when
connector_17
use
different
web
component_1
technology_7
fastify
fastify
a
it
name
imply
be
build
with
the
intention
of
be
a
very
fast
technology_2
web
technology_7
despite
it
coding_keyword_8
goal
of
quality_attribute_2
it
actually
do
a
very
nice
of
achieve
our
ideal
pattern_6
syntax
this
example
be
so
terse
that
it
almost
feel
cheat
coding_keyword_2
fastify
=
require
fastify
coding_keyword_2
component_7
=
fastify
component_7
coding_keyword_1
component_3
pattern_9
req
connector_data_1
=
{
coding_keyword_4
{
error
false
username
req
body
username
}
}
component_7
listen

then
=
{
console
requirement_2
component_1
run
at
technology_3
localhost

}
fastify
not
only
support
pattern_9
for
use
a
pattern_6

but
it
also
automatically
par
incoming
connector_data_5
into
technology_4
if
the
content
type
coding_keyword_3
suggest
the
body
be
technology_5
this
be
why
the
example
end
up
be
so
tiny
this
also
mean
that
we
can
rely
on
fastify
to
respond
with
a
sane
error
when
requirement_1
fail
for
example
when
the
component_9
connector_18
invalid
technology_4
to
fastify
the
connector_12
will
look
something
this
{
statuscode

error
bad
connector_data_2
connector_data_4
unexpected
coding_keyword_7
in
technology_4
at
position

}
koa
koa
be
a
sort
of
spiritual
successor
to
express
j
have
be
connector_17
by
some
of
the
original
express
j
author
it
do
support
pattern_9
out
the
door
but
it
doesn’t
come
with
a
pattern_2
of
it
own
we
can
make
use
of
koa
pattern_2
to
provide
connector_19
here’s
what
our
example
pattern_6
might
look
with
koa
coding_keyword_2
koa
=
require
koa
coding_keyword_2
pattern_2
=
require
koa
pattern_2
coding_keyword_2
component_7
=
koa
coding_keyword_2
pattern_2
=
pattern_2
pattern_2
coding_keyword_1
component_3
pattern_9
ctx
=
{
try
{
coding_keyword_2
requirement_1
=
await
requestbodyjson
ctx
req
ctx
body
=
{
error
false
username
requirement_1
username
}
}
catch
e
{
ctx
status
=

ctx
body
=
{
error
cannot_parse
}
}
}
component_7
use
pattern_2
connector_19
component_7
listen

this
koa
example
isn’t
a
succinct
a
the
fastify
version
it
doesn’t
perform
the
automatic
technology_4
requirement_1
but
we’re
able
to
quality_attribute_3
the
requestbodyjson
we
create
early
it
also
doesn’t
use
the
coding_keyword_4
resolve
requirement_5
from
our
pattern_6
but
instead
work
by
connector_20
connector_data_3
attach
to
the
ctx
argument
takeaway
when
technology_2
be
still
in
it
infancy
express
j
become
the
obvious
choice
for
build
web
component_2
express
j
have
the
goal
of
be
a
convenient
web
component_1
that
follow
the
pattern_4
paradigm
it
achieve
that
goal
and
the
technology_16
be
now
essentially
complete
however
a
the
technology_14
ecosystem
have
mature
we’ve
gain
technology_11
technology_8
and
syntax
dozen
if
not
hundred
of
technology_7
have
arise
since
then
many
of
which
have
embrace
these
technology_11
feature
if
you
find
yourself
work
on
a
project
connector_17
in
technology_2
that
act
a
a
web
component_1
i

i
recommend
the

pattern_9
package
instead
technology_3
www

technology_18
package
technology_10
pattern_9
if
you
be
go
to
use
pattern_9
a
a
technology_10
i
highly
recommend
you
wrap
it
by
a
helper

such
a
technology_10
pattern_9
it
be
well
test
and
i
use
it
in
many
production
project
there
be
also
handy
helper
combinemiddlewares
middlewaretopromise
combinetoasync
which
be
very
useful
in
test

no
pattern_9
error

pattern_9
error
not
catch
the
connector_24
hang
until
the
component_9
stop
it

pattern_9
wrap
with
technology_10
