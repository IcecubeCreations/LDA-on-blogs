about

how
pattern_2
be
relevant
to

explore
the

of

and
lastly
the
type
of

a

preference
they
provide
a
range
of
option
to
solve
the
problem
you
can
face
it
follow
that
the
architecture
of
pattern_2
be
base
on
a
variety
of
connector_2
pattern_2
they
be
a
form
of

a
to
how
component_2
boundary
can
be
draw
and
that
independent
quality_attribute_2
be
important
pattern_2
also
have
the
advantage
of
be
an
agnostic

from
a
technical
point
of

pattern_2
reveal
the

that
they

figure

principle

improperly
architecture
an
component_6
base
on

might
end
up
be

there
the
pattern_2
connector_5
the
same
component_5
or
even
the

to
solve
these
problem
one
approach
be
to
adapt
domain
—
drive
design
restrict
connector_6
use
scoping
rule
use
component_8
to
encourage
loose
couple
pattern_7
component_8
shouldn’t
be
tightly
couple
to
specific
component_9
or
component_2
effectively
the
idea
be
to
connector_7
the
boundary
right
towards
high
pattern_1
and
low
couple
if
a
pattern_6
rely
on
the
physical
connector_8
of
another
component_2
then
there’s
tight
location
couple
the
component_2
discovery
technology_2
can
solve
this
if
a
pattern_6
need
to
wait
for
another’s
connector_9
there’s
temporal
couple
therefore
a
connector_data_2
bus
or
connector_10
can
solve
this
brief
history
about
couple
and
cohesionthe
two
form
of
concept
couple
and
pattern_1
have
be
use
in
computing
for
a
long
time
with
the
idea
first
propose
by
larry
constantine
in

a
relatively
auspicious
year
for
computing
at
the
national
symposium
on
modular
programming
such
twin
concept
of
couple
and
pattern_1
go
on
to
form
the
foundation
of
how
much
we
think
of
connector_11
component_10
component_7
so
let’s
go
to
a
bit
more
deep
about
couple
and
pattern_1
couple
and
cohesionthe
two
concept
“coupling”
and
“cohesion”
have
be
common
when
describe
the
boundary
of
pattern_2
couple
talk
about
how
to
connector_12
one
thing
need
a
connector_12
in
another
and
pattern_1
talk
about
how
we
organize
the

these
two
term
have
also
be
closely
relate
by
follow
the
rule
of
constantine
this
relationship
be
well
articulate
a
connector_data_3
be
quality_attribute_4
if
pattern_1
be
high
and
couple
be
low
by
larry
constantine
this
have
be
a
wise
and
valuable
concept
for
couple
and
pattern_1
ex
if
we
have
two
piece
of
similarly
connector_13

pattern_1
be
weak
a
the
relevant
requirement_3
be
scatter
over
both
part
we
do
have
a
strong
couple
because
a
this
connector_12
all
connector_data_4
need
to
connector_12
what
be
pattern_1
pattern_1
be
the
degree
to
which
the
member
of
a
certain
belong
together
it
be
a
measure
of
how
deeply
each
piece
of
component_11
requirement_3
relate
fenton
and
bieman

therefore
the
most
suitable
term
for
define
pattern_1
be
“the
that
shift
together
stay
together
”
a
we
can
see
strong
pattern_1
make
think
smooth
and
reduce

something
that
we
should
be
careful
of
the
more
issue
be
“coupled
”
the
more
they
tend
to
adjust
together
so
there
be
various
form
of

for
this
so
different
solution
that
be
need
for
each
type
but
until
we
proceed
to
the
various
form
of
couple
let’s
describe
the
“information

strategy
in
the

type
of

the
most
pervasive
type

also
connector_12
a
typical
and
popular
example
of
an

be
the
connector_15
of
a

the

component_2
offer
our

with
connector_data_5
that
they
would
choose
to
buy
on
the
basis
of
past

such
connector_data_7
be
automatically
directly

from
the
component_5
through

it
break
the

apart
conceptually
also
provide

so
will
see
if
the

this
connector_data_5
it
be
easy
to
conceal
the
specific
of
the
implementation
a
figure

indicate
that
the
recommendation
component_2
have
connector_6
to
the
connector_data_5
it
want
through
an
component_15
connector_data_9
we
will
also
the
order
component_2
quality_attribute_3
a
dataset
in
the
form
of
a
component_5
that
be
mean
to
be
use
by
component_13
for

connector_6
—
figure


that
the
order
component_2
can
publish
connector_data_1
and
any
improvement
make
to
the
order
component_2
be
invisible
to
requirement_4
because
it
retain
a
contract
the
act
of
hide
a
component_5
behind
a
well
define
component_16
help
the
requirement_5
to
narrow
the
complexity
of
what
be
reveal
and
will
allow
u
to
alter
how
this
connector_data_1
be
interpret
another
trick
that
come
when
describe
a
component_2
that
us
“outside
—
in”
think
that
guide
the
component_2
by
first
look
about
problem
from
the
point
of
pattern_4
of
the
component_2
component_13
and
then
find
out
how
to
connector_17
the
component_2
contract
temporal
couplingtemporal
couple
be
mainly
a
runtime
problem
that
typically
point
to
one
of
the
problem
of
pattern_8
connector_data_10
in
a
quality_attribute_3
set
mean
that
when
a
connector_data_2
be
connector_18
and
how
the
connector_data_2
be
handle
it
be
connector_13
in
time
and
we
be
suppose
to
have
a
temporary
couple
take
a
typical
example
to
see
this
methoda
pattern_8
technology_3
connector_data_9
be
make
from
the
requirement_6
component_2
to
the
downstream
order
component_2
to
connector_7
the
correct
order
detail
in
order
to
fulfill
the
connector_data_9
the
order
component_2
must
in
effect
connector_19
the
detail
from
the
requirement_4
component_2
through
a
pattern_8
technology_3
connector_data_10
in
order
to
achieve
this
overall
component_17
the
requirement_6
order
and
requirement_4
component_1
must
all
be
up
and
contactable
they’re
temporally
bind
together
there
be
a
variety
of
approach
to
reduce
this
issue
we
would
use
pattern_9
if
the
order
component_2
component_18
the
connector_data_5
it
want
from
the
requirement_4
component_2
then
in
certain
situation
the
order
component_2
will
be
able
to
prevent
a
temporary
connector_20
to
the
downstream
line
the
next
thing
we
should
suggest
be
the
use
of
pattern_10
transport
to
connector_21
connector_data_2
maybe
anything
a
connector_data_2
pattern_11
this
will
then
require
the
connector_data_2
to
be
connector_22
to
a
downstream
technology_4
to
make
it
quality_attribute_6
for
the
connector_data_2
to
be
handle
deployment
couplingwhen
we
consider
a
single
component_17
which
consist
of
multiple
statically
connector_23

so
when
a
connector_12
be
make
to
a
single
line
of
in
one
of
those

and
there
we
should
quality_attribute_7
that
connector_12
so
to
do
this
we
have
to
quality_attribute_7
the
entire
monolith
include
the
that
be
unchanged
therefore
everything
should
be
quality_attribute_7
together
so
we
be
use
deployment
couple
quality_attribute_7
carry
risk
there
be
lot
of
way
to
reduce
the
risk
of
deployment
one
be
to
connector_12
only
what
need
to
be
connector_12
if
we
can
reduce
the
deployment
couple
perhaps
decompose
large
component_12
into
independently
quality_attribute_1
pattern_2
we
can
reduce
the
risk
of
each
deployment
by
reduce
the
scope
of
the
deployment
small
release
be
make
for
le
risk
there
be
le
to
go
wrong
if
something
go
wrong
work
out
what
go
wrong
and
how
to
fix
be
easy
because
only
a
small
amount
be
connector_12
le
and
when
reduce
the
size
of
the
release
make
fast
feedback
and
release
—

small
the
scope
of
the
release
the
easy
and
quality_attribute_8
it
be
to
roll
out
and
the
fast
the
feedback
we
connector_7
reduce
deployment
couple
doesn’t
require
micro
component_2
runtimes
technology_5
allow
for
the
pattern_12
deployment
of
version
of
into
a
run
component_17
domain
couplingthere
must
be
some
with
participant
in
a
component_4
compose
of
several
independent
component_2
thus
in
a
pattern_6
architecture
domain
couple
be
the
connector_data_11
—
connector_24
between
component_1
be
component_19
connector_24
in
our
actual
domain
to
give
a
specific
example
consider
music
corp
there’s
a
shop
in
there
that
sell
technology_6
when
component_13
place
order
for
cd
staff
work
in
the
requirement_6
need
to
consider
what
connector_data_4
need
to
be
selected
and
pack
and
where
the
shipment
need
to
be
ship
the
connector_data_5
on
the
order
must
then
be
exchange
with
the
people
who
work
in
the
requirement_6
figure

illustrate
this
feature
—
the
order
component_17
component_2
connector_25
all
the
specific
of
the
shipment
to
the
requirement_6
department
which
then
release
the
connector_data_12
to
be
pack
a
part
of
the
component_17
however
the
requirement_6
requirement_5
us
the
requirement_4
to
gather
requirement_4
connector_data_5
from
the
requirement_4
component_2
and
then
we
how
to
alert
them
when
the
order
be
connector_26
out
but
in
this
requirement_7
we
connector_5
the
whole
order
with
the
requirement_6
which
make
little
sense
—
because
the
requirement_6
want
connector_data_5
on
what
to
load
and
where
to
connector_27
it
and
the
issue
with
connector_data_5
that
we
use
to
pattern_13
connector_6
to
be
exchange
so
easily
—
if
the
full
order
be
exchange
we
might
end
up
reveal
credit
card
connector_data_1
to
technology_4
that
do
not
need
it
ex
instead
we’ll
come
up
with
a
pick
instruction
domain
definition
that
include
all
the
requirement_6
component_2
require
detail
a
you’ll
see
in
figure

another
example
of
hide
connector_data_5
couple
can
be
further
minimize
by
reduce
the
need
for
a
requirement_6
component_2
so
if
you
need
to
about
a
component_20
we
will
then
include
all
the
necessary
connector_data_5
through
the
pick
instruction
a
see
in
figure

however
there
be
a
issue
for
this
solution
to
figure
out
which
assume
that
at
some
stage
order
component_17
would
have
connector_6
to
the
requirement_4
component_2
in
order
to
be
able
to
produce
the
pick
instruction
although
it
be
possible
that
order
component_17
will
also
continue
to
have
connector_6
to
requirement_4
connector_data_5
for
certain
purpose
and
that
be
unlikely
to
be
a
concern
a
a
consequence
there
be
an
alternative
solution
where
order
component_17
produce
some
kind
of
that
the
requirement_6
absorb
see
in
figure

the
mechanism
operate
this
—
order
component_17
rely
on
the
requirement_6
component_2
to
ensure
that
the
shipment
be
connector_27
to
the
requirement_6
to
respond
to
activity
from
the
order
component_17
component_2
we
have
elaborate
the
couple
and
pattern_1
in
pattern_2
and
