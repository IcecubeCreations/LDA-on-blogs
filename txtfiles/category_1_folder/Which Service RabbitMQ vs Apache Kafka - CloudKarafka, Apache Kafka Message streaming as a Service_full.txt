in
almost
every
profession
choose
the
right
technology_4
to
perform
the
basic
can
be
a
complex
decision
for
developer
there
be
dozen
of
pattern_1
component_2
to
choose
from
a
common
question
be
which
component_1
to
use
technology_1
or
technology_2
technology_3
this
will
present
use
requirement_1
and
requirement_2
of
both
component_3
to
help
you
make
an
inform
decision
put
all
the
noise
aside
from
fan
of
each
component_1
who
make
it
seem
their
way
be
the
only
choice
this
will
serve
a
an
authoritative
answer
base
on
experience
and
knowledge
of
both
component_4
the
insight
connector_3
in
this
be
base
on
in
depth
discussion
with
experience
developer
who
have
sound
reason
for
choose
one
component_1
over
another
the
term
both
component_5
be
connector_data_1
component_6
though
technology_3
refer
to
their
component_6
a
a
requirement_3
to
simplify
the
connector_data_2
for
quality_attribute_1
comparison
this
will
refer
to
component_7
for
both
component_1
connector_data_3
in
technology_3
be
often
connector_4
component_8
but
again
to
simplify
this
will
only
refer
to
connector_data_1
technology_3
also
us
the
word
topic
which
be
essentially
a
categorization
inside
a
component_6
topic
be
divide
into
component_9
contain
sequential
component_10
that
cannot
be
connector_5
the
similarity
both
technology_1
and
technology_2
technology_3
pass
connector_data_3
between
component_11
and
component_12
through
component_7
topic
connector_data_3
can
include
any
kind
of
connector_data_2
such
a
a
quality_attribute_2
text
connector_data_1
that
connector_6
a
chain
of
on
other
component_13
a
pattern_1
component_4
be
ideal
for
build
a
pattern_2
component_14
connector_7
different
component_15
pass
work
onto
remote
component_16
and
real
time
connector_data_4
connector_8
both
connector_data_1
component_2
be
consider
mature
with
technology_1
on
the
requirement_4
since

and
technology_3
operate
since

the
quality_attribute_3
and
quality_attribute_4
of
both
component_2
be
on
pretty
much
equal
footing
which
be
why
the
two
be
often
compare
the
difference
between
the
two
and
your
component_17
need
be
what
dictate
which
component_1
to
use
when
the
difference
unlike
most
pattern_1
component_4
kafka’s
component_6
be
persistent
this
mean
that
connector_data_4
connector_9
to
technology_3
be
component_18
until
a
specific
time
period
have
pass
or
a
size
limit
have
be
reach
until
one
of
those
two
thing
happen
the
connector_data_1
remain
in
the
component_6
even
after
it
be
connector_10
in
technology_3
connector_data_3
can
be
replay
or
connector_10
multiple
time
an
adjustable
set
useful
in
different
scenario
technology_1
on
the
other
hand
connector_11
connector_data_3
until
a
connector_12
component_13
connector_13
to
the
component_6
and
connector_14
it
the
component_19
can
acknowledge
the
connector_data_1
at
that
point
or
when
the
component_20
be
complete
either
way
once
the
connector_data_1
be
acked
it’s
go
from
the
component_6
to
replay
or
not
to
replay
it
be
possible
to
replay
connector_data_3
in
technology_3
mean
that
your
component_13
can
connector_15
a
connector_data_1
multiple
time
take
advantage
of
the
ability
to
replay
a
connector_data_1
in
technology_3
should
be
do
mindfully
for
example
connector_16
a
requirement_5
order
multiple
time
be
not
usually
a
quality_attribute_1
idea
on
the
other
hand
say
your
component_21
have
a
bug
and
a

version
need
to
be
quality_attribute_5
be
able
to
reprocess
some
or
all
of
the
connector_data_3
at
that
point
be
a
large
benefit
connector_data_3
in
technology_1
can
not
be
replay
since
they
be
remove
once
they
be
ack
ed
however
a
technology_1
component_19
can
nack
negative
acknowledgement
a
connector_data_1
when
it
fail
to
handle
the
connector_data_1
this
be
useful
in
requirement_1
of
a
temporary
failure
on
the
component_21
side
the
connector_data_1
will
simply
be

back
to
the
component_6
technology_5
another
difference
between
technology_1
and
technology_2
technology_3
be
the
technology_5
while
technology_1
support
several
different
technology_5
such
a
technology_6
technology_7
stomp
etc
technology_3
us
a
custom
technology_5
on
top
of
technology_8
ip
to
connector_17
between
the
component_17
and
the
cluster
rabbitmq’s
versatility
in
technology_5
give
it
the
advantage
in
more
scenario
over
technology_3
connector_18
the
complexity
with
which
connector_data_3
be
connector_19
be
another
difference
between
the
two
connector_data_1
component_1
while
technology_1
have
a
more
complex
connector_18

technology_3
be
very
quality_attribute_2
quality_attribute_2
be
quality_attribute_1
right
not
in
this
requirement_1
one
of
the
big
benefit
of
technology_1
be
the
quality_attribute_6
it
have
to
connector_20
connector_data_1
technology_1
have
four
different
option
for
connector_18
connector_data_3
direct
topic
fanout
and
exchange
direct
exchange
connector_20
the
connector_data_1
to
all
component_7
that

key
exactly

allow
for

through
a

fanout
exchange
pattern_3
connector_data_3
to
every
component_6
that
be
bind
to
the
exchange
exchange
use
the
connector_data_2
find
in
the
connector_data_1

and
optional
requirement_6
very
similar
to
topic
exchange
but
without
the
connector_18
key
see
this
for
more
connector_data_2
on
different
exchange
type
technology_3
on
the
other
hand
do
not
support
connector_18
and
instead
rely
upon
component_9
that
contain
connector_data_3
in
a
sequence
that
be
completely
unchangeable
create
your
own
dynamic
connector_18
with
the
help
of
technology_3
connector_21
be
an
option
but
not
a
default
with
technology_3
and
require
the
use
of
component_21
group
and
persistent
topic
priority
in
technology_1
a
component_6
can
be
set
up
to
have
a
range
of
priority
quality_attribute_7
on
the
message’s
priority
it
be
place
in
the
appropriate
component_6
in
technology_3
a
connector_data_1
cannot
be
connector_9
with
a
priority
level
nor
can
it
be
connector_22
in
priority
order
all
connector_data_3
in
technology_3
be
treat
a
equal
and
connector_22
in
the
order
in
which
they
be
connector_23
no
matter
how
busy
the
component_21
be
acking
acknowledgment
or
acking
be
the
signal
two
component_22
give
each
other
of
receipt
of
the
connector_data_1
connector_9
or
handle
both
technology_1
and
technology_2
technology_3
support
component_23
acknowledgment
to
confirm
connector_data_3
have
safely
reach
the
pattern_4
in
technology_1
a
connector_data_1
can
be
consider
connector_22
once
it
be
connector_9
or
when
it
have
be
connector_23
by
the
component_21
conversely
technology_1
component_24
can
also
nack
negative
acknowledge
a
connector_data_1
if
it
fail
to
be
handle

it
to
the
component_6
a
if
it
be

technology_3
maintain
an
offset
for
each
connector_data_1
in
a
component_9
with
the
connector_24
position
the
last
offset
connector_25
if
the
component_20
fail
and
restart
it
be
this
offset
that
it
will
recover
to
component_12
in
technology_3
can
connector_24
offset
periodically
or
manually
how
this
be
keep
track
of
differ
in
different
version
of
technology_3
component_6
quality_attribute_8
for
technology_1
the
quality_attribute_8
of
the
component_6
be
at
it
greatest
when
the
component_6
be
empty
technology_3
be
design
for
hold
large
volume
of
connector_data_1
so
emptiness
be
not
a
factor
in
the
quality_attribute_8
enabling
lazy
component_7
in
technology_1
be
a
great
way
to
make
a
more
quality_attribute_9
cluster
if
you
think
your
component_12
won’t
keep
up
with
the
quality_attribute_8
of
the
pattern_5
quality_attribute_10
both
technology_1
and
technology_3
be
quality_attribute_11
in
their
own
way
give
you
the
ability
to
adjust
the
number
of

the
power
of
the
pattern_4
or
more
technology_9
a
require

publish
fast
than
your
component_12
perform
in

lead
to
the
component_6
grow
into
million
of
connector_data_3
and
eventually
run
out
of
memory
in
this
requirement_1
quality_attribute_10
the
number
of
component_12
that
be
handle
the
connector_data_1
be
an
easy
way
to
accommodate
this
scenario
each
component_6
in
technology_1
can
have
many
component_21
who
can
all
compete
to
connector_10
the
connector_data_3
on

more

to

up
because
there
will

be
a

on
how

however

complexity
the
opinion
of
the
developer
we
work
with
be
that
kafka’s

be
more

a
it

such
a

be
a

of

failure

be
a
complication
of

with

which
require
more

be
more
complicate
than
in
technology_1
ecosystem
technology_3
be
more
than
a
pattern_4
it
be
a

component_14
with

most
of
these
additional

come
from

be
not

the
benefit
of
these

be
that
