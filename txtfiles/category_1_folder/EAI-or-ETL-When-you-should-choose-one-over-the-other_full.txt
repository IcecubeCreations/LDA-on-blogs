a
part
of
our
quarterly
review
component_3
of
all
the
faq
we
have
decide
to
touch
upon
the
most
frequently
talk
about
subject
technology_1
vs
eai
in
this
we
look
to
connector_1
some
of
the
pain
point
involve
in
the
decision
make
component_3
between
the
two
what
they
mean
to
your
requirement_10
and
when
you
should
draw
boundary
between
these
two
requirement_1
technique
a
part
of
any
connector_data_1
requirement_1
strategy
it
be
a
golden
rule
of
thumb
to
follow
‘prevent
and
prepare
rather
than
repent
and
repair’
in
most
requirement_12
concern
requirement_10
intelligence
initiative
if
you
what
you
don’t
need
you
be
already
halfway
through
in
the
quest
to
what
you
want
to
achieve
requirement_10
requirement_8
invest
million
of
dollar
on
pattern_1
initiative
and
connector_data_1
warehousing
and
hence
rely
on
consistent
quality_attribute_2
and
quality_attribute_3
connector_data_1
thus
follow
proper
requirement_1
technique
become
all
the
more
vital
with
concern
to
requirement_8
requirement_1
strategy
eai
be
essential
for
maintain
perfect
harmony
between
requirement_10
need
and
it
solution
whereas
connector_data_1
requirement_1
a
of
technology_1
be
a
constant
need
a
inconsistent
connector_data_1
at
the
heart
of
any
pattern_1
initiative
fail
to
provide
an
quality_attribute_2
picture
of
the
requirement_10
hence
the
vital
question
eai
or
technology_1
what
be

be
define
a
a
component_3
of
align
a
business’s
strategic
vision
with

connector_data_2
technology_6
in
other
word
eai
be
mainly
component_3
requirement_1
that
exist
to
allow
component_7
component_8
to
operate
on
connector_data_1
from
across
the
requirement_10
through
component_9
connector_data_3
without
regard
to
it
location
pattern_2
technology_6
or
technology_7
it
involve
the
requirement_1
of
incompatible
requirement_10
component_8
within
and
beyond
the
requirement_8
to
allow
them
to
talk
to
each
other
seamlessly
and
to
connector_2
connector_data_1
in
real

what

enable
the

the

and
then
devise

some
of
the

whether

require

to

combine
