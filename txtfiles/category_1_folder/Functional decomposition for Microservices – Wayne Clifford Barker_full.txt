functional

by

functional
decomposition
be
a
way
to
decompose
\
break
down
a
component_1
into
it
most
simplistic
component_2
and
for
rapid
component_3
development
download
the
power

the
slide
and
image
for
functional
decomposition
here
advantage
easy
to
do
can
be
apply
to
most
requirement_1
component_3
a
a
once
of
implementation
simplistic
very
rapid
to
connector_2
connector_data_1
in
the
begin
do
not
require
a
skilled
architect
development
cost
be
low
in
the
begin
disadvantage
very
chatty
many
connector_data_2
from
component_4
use
requirement_2
be
not
pattern_2
can
not
isolate
a
component_5
to
test
a
specific
use
requirement_2
very
difficult
to
pin
point
or
troubleshoot
requirement_3
issue
not
the
best
for
requirement_3
a
the
chattiness
will
hamper
load
do
not
handle
connector_3
in
requirement
very
well
and
connector_3
will
ricochet
through
the
component_1
affect
many
component_5
core
use
requirement_2
be
not
consider
and
a
such
core
use
requirement_2
can
not
be
isolate
or
quality_attribute_1
independently
connector_data_3
in
all
or
unrelated
component_2
be
quality_attribute_1
–
escalate
cost
a
the
component_1
grow
in
size
the
complexity
go
up
quality_attribute_2
of
delivery
degrade
with
time
who
should
use
functional
decomposition
functional
decomposition
should
be
use
for
component_3
where
the
connector_3
of
requirement
be
not
a
possibility
of
very
limit
where
the
development
time
be
time
component_6
the
component_3
will
never
need
to
be
extend
after
development
the
component_3
will
have
a
short
lifetime


year
require
rapid
component_3
development
in
this
example
i
will
show
a
purely
functional
decomposition
many
component_7
out
there
use
a
mix
of
different
decomposition
type
component_4
requirement
a
component_1
design
always
start
with
component_8
requirement
below
be
some
component_8
story
that
i
make
up
from
which
i
will
do
a
component_1
design
a
a
end
component_8
i
need
to
be
to
register
myself
on
a
technology_1
or
io
requirement_1
component_9
part
of
the
registration
will
allow
me
to
subscribe
to
connector_4
text
connector_data_4
alert
about
future

i
should
be
able
to
login
and
browse
for
music
at
various
location
and
make
a
book
to
attend
it
my
only
payment
option
will
be
to
use
paypal
a
a
requirement_4
i
need
to
login
to
web
base
component_1
so
that
i
can
load

update
and
delete
music

end
component_10
should
connector_5
a
text
connector_data_4
when
additional
music
connector_2

at
a
late
date
if
you
have
a
ba
then
the
component_1
requirement
will
be
connector_data_5
out
in
a
document
for
you
and
you
should
connector_5
a
use
requirement_2
diagram
use
requirement_2
diagram
this
be
usually
the
first
step
in
design
a
component_1
for
the
architect
this
be
the
document
where
it
all
begin
if
you
don’t
have
a
ba
or
do
not
connector_5
a
document
this
you
will
have
to
draw
it
up
yourself
and
have
it
validate
by
the
component_4
and
always
remember
requirement
always
connector_3
it
be
important
to
ask
many
question
at
this
level
and
don’t
start
a
design
until
you
be
comfortable
that
the
use
requirement_2
be
complete
functional
decomposition
from
the
use
requirement_2
diagram
it
be
very
easy
to
decompose
a
component_1
functionally
you
start
by
identify
the
actor
and
create
a
pattern_3
for
each
component_8
requirement_4
identify
any
supportive
component_1
paypal
identity
technology_2
\

text
connector_data_4
technology_2
next
you
simply
connector_data_5
the
of
the
actor
to
the
pattern_1
it
be
also
possible
to
cut
it
this
–
it
come
down
to
the
same
connector_data_3
in
the
end
pattern_4
next
you
build
a
pattern_4
show
the
layout
of
the
component_5
a
architect
you
can
start
to
make
technology_3
decision
i
have
decide
that
we
will
be
use
technology_4
for
this
example
connector_data_6
chain
the
next
step
of
the
architect
be
to
take
one
of
the
use
requirement_2
activity
and
connector_data_5
it
out
over
the
pattern_4
to
create
a
connector_data_6
chain
diagram
a
the
architect
you
will
have
to
consider
the
connector_6
mode
and
technology_5
pattern_5
or
pattern_6
technology_6
technology_7
or
component_11
bus
the
connector_data_6
chain
diagram
show
which
component_2
participate
in
a
use
requirement_2
what
connector_data_7
be
use
which
connector_data_7
need
to
be
pattern_5
and
pattern_6
to
simplify
the
diagram
i
will
be
replace
the
different
type
of
component_12
with
a
block
connector_7
component_4
from
the
connector_data_6
chain
one
of
the
drawback
of
functional
decomposition
become
visible
a
you
can
see
the
component_4
be
handle
the
pattern_7
of
the
use
requirement_2
which
mean
that
the
component_4
be
carry
requirement_5
component_13
it
be
also
easy
to
see
the
component_1
be
go
to
be
very
chatty
to
show
that
this
be
not
an
isolate
problem
i
do
another
connector_data_6
chain
from
here
you
can
see
the
ui
be
still
pattern_8
and
something
else
if
a
another
pay
be
connector_8
the
component_1
would
have
no
easy
way
to
handle
the
connector_3
if
i
use
the
2nd
functional
decomposition
design
the
connector_data_6
chain
would
look
this
something
be
wrong
a
soon
a
you
see

component_14
connector_9
each
other
this
it
be
an
indication
that
there
be
something
wrong
the
use
requirement_2
be
not
pattern_2
properly
and
be
connector_data_3
in
pattern_9
connector_data_7
from
one
component_11
to
the
next
this
tell
you
that
they
can
not
independently
and
actually
need
to
be
one
component_11
summary
functional
decomposition
do
have
it
place
in
quality_attribute_3
once
off
component_3
but
for
any
large
component_15
a
different
decomposition
should
be
consider
in
the
next
i
will
continue
and
show
how
pattern_1
could
be
design

control
