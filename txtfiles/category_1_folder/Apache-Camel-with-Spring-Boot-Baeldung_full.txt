in

this
be
the
reason
for
the

that
create
a

quality_attribute_3

connector_18
it
down
to
a

pattern_2
notice
that
the
connector_5
always
connector_19

so
that

connector_5
will

our

that

the

in

we

quality_attribute_2
to
output
to
the
requirement_2
the
component_12
attribute
that
be
inside
the
technology_2
connector_data_8
body
we
can
also
use
it
to
do
quality_attribute_2
transformation
a

pattern_2
to

connector_data_1
quality_attribute_2
isn

conclusion
with
a
few
line
of
we
manage
to
create
a
relatively
complete
component_5
all
connector_8
be
build
manage
and
run
automatically
with
a
single
command
moreover
we
can
create
component_2
that
tie
together
all
sort
of
technology_7
this
approach
be
also
very
container
friendly
connector_data_7
in
a
very
lean
component_6
environment
that
can
be
easily
replicate
on
demand
the
extra
configuration
possibility
can
easily
be
incorporate
into
a
container
template
configuration
