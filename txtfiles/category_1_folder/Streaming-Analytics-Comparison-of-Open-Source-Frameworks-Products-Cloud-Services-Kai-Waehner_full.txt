the
story




in

i
be
at
requirement_3
spain
in
madrid
for
the
first
time
a
great
conference
with
many
awesome
speaker
and
component_8
about
very
pattern_4
topic
such
a
technology_3
technology_5
technology_4
technology_4
connector_1
component_7
connector_1
requirement_1
and
requirement_5
if
you
be
interest
in
requirement_3
then
this
conference
be
for
you
my
two
talk
“how
to
apply
requirement_5
to
real
time
processing”
see
slide
and
video
component_2
from
a
similar
conference
talk
“comparison
of
connector_1
requirement_1
options”
the
reason
for
this

an
update
version
of
my
talk
from
javaone

here
i
wanna
connector_7
the
slide
and
a
video
component_2
of
the
latter
one…
abstract
comparison
of
connector_4
component_7
option
this
component_9
discus
the
technical
concept
of
connector_4
component_7
connector_1
requirement_1
and
how
it
be
relate
to
requirement_3
requirement_10
requirement_2
and
internet
of
thing
different
use
requirement_11
such
a
predictive
fault
requirement_9
or
fraud
detection
be
use
to
show
and
compare
alternative
technology_1
and
technology_2
for
connector_4
component_7
and
connector_1
requirement_1
the
focus
of
the
component_9
lie
on
compare
different
open_source
technology_1
such
a
technology_3
technology_18
technology_3
flink
or
technology_3
technology_4
connector_1
component_10
from
vendor
such
a
infosphere
connector_4
technology_19
streambase
requirement_2
offer
such
a
technology_17
kinesis
real
time
connector_1
uis
such
a
striim
zoomdata
or
technology_19
live
datamart
live
demo
will
give
the
audience
a
quality_attribute_1
feel
about
how
to
use
these
technology_1
and
technology_20
the
component_9
will
also
discus
how
connector_4
component_7
be
relate
to
technology_3
technology_5
technology_1
such
a
mapreduce
technology_21
technology_22
or
technology_23
and
