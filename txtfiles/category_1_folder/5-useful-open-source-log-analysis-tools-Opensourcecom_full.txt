be
now
offer
a
either
an

quickly
graylog
have

administrator
because
of

most
web

start
small
but
can
grow

graylog
can
balance
load
across
a

component_5
and
handle
several
terabyte
of
requirement_1
connector_data_1
each

it

to

requirement_9
graylog
be
build
around
the

component_6
you
find

and
quickly
see
trend
over

make

together
nagios

have
since
quality_attribute_7
into

of
the

quality_attribute_2
open_source
technology_1
for
manage
requirement_1

the
current
version
of

can
quality_attribute_8
with

run

it
primary
technology_17
be
a

which
aim

more
quality_attribute_9
to

the

thanks
to
the
build

wizard
nagios
be
most
often
use
in
organization
that
need
to
pattern_3
the
quality_attribute_6
of
their
local
requirement_4
it
can
audit
a
range
of

relate
and
help
automate
the

of
alert
nagios
can
even
be
configure

allow
you
to
resolve

before
a
human
have
to
connector_6
involve

audit
nagios
will
pattern_4
requirement_1
connector_data_1
base
on
the
geographic
location
where
it
originate
that
mean
you
can
build
comprehensive
requirement_10

to

how
your

be

the

technology_18
elastic
technology_18
often
connector_7
the
elk
technology_18
be
one
of
the
most
popular
open_source
technology_1
among
organization
that
need
to
sift
through
large
set
of
connector_data_1
and
make
sense
of
their
component_11
requirement_1
and
it
s
a
personal
favorite
too
it
primary
offer
be
make
up
of
three
separate
technology_17
elasticsearch
kibana
and
logstash
a
it
name
suggest
elasticsearch
be
design
to
help
component_15
find
match
within
datasets
use
a
wide
range
of
query
technology_19
and
type
quality_attribute_10
be
this
technology_1
s
number
one
advantage
it
can
be
expand
into
cluster
of
hundred
of
component_9
technology_20
to
handle
petabyte
of
connector_data_1
with
ease
kibana
be
a
visualization
technology_1
that
run
alongside
elasticsearch
to
allow
component_15
to
analyze
their
connector_data_1
and
build
powerful
report
when
you
first
install
the
kibana
component_13
on
your
component_9
cluster
you
will
gain
connector_8
to
an
that
show
statistic
graph
and
even
animation
of
your
connector_data_1
the
final
piece
of
elk
technology_18
be
logstash
which
act
a
a
purely
component_9
side
pipeline
into
the
elasticsearch
component_10
you
can
quality_attribute_8
logstash
with
a
variety
of
cod
technology_19
and
component_16
so
that
connector_data_2
from
your

and
requirement_11
component_2
will
be
feed
directly
into
your
powerful
elastic
stalk
search
component_13
a
unique
feature
of
elk
technology_18
be
that
it
allow
you
to
pattern_3
component_2
build
on
open_source
installation
of
technology_21
in
contrast
to
most
out
of
the
component_17
quality_attribute_6
audit
requirement_1
technology_1
that
track
admin
and
technology_22
requirement_1
but
little
else
elk
technology_18
can
sift
through
web
component_9
and
component_10
requirement_1
poor
requirement_1
track
and
component_10
requirement_8
be
one
of
the
most
common
cause
of
poor
requirement_6
failure
to
regularly
connector_9
optimize
and
empty
component_10
requirement_1
can
not
only
slow
down
a
but
could
lead
to
a
complete
crash
a
well
thus
the
elk
technology_18
be
an
excellent
technology_1
for
every
technology_21
developer

technology_23
logalyze
logalyze
be
an
organization
base
in
hungary
that
build
open_source
technology_1
for
component_11
administrator
and
quality_attribute_6
expert
to
help
them
manage
component_9
requirement_1
and
turn
them
into

point
it
primary

be
quality_attribute_3
a
a

logalyze
be

it
provide
a

requirement_1
in

and
start
analyze
it
from
within

web

you
can

these

for
example
logalyze
can

run
different

report
to
ensure
your
organization
be
adhere
to
health
regulation
and
remain
compliant
fluentd
if
your
organization
have
connector_data_1
component_6
live
in
many
different
location
and
environment
your
goal
should
be
to
centralize
them
a
much
a
possible
otherwise
you
will
struggle
to
pattern_3
requirement_6
and
protect
against
quality_attribute_6
threat
fluentd
be
a
quality_attribute_5
solution
for
connector_data_1
collection
and
be
entirely
open_source
it
do
not
offer
a
full
frontend
but
instead
act
a
a
collection
pattern_5
to
help
organize

fluentd
be
use
by
some
of
the
large
requirement_5
worldwide
but
can
be
connector_10
in

organization
a
well
the
big
benefit
of
fluentd
be
it
quality_attribute_12
with
the
most
common
technology_8
technology_1
quality_attribute_3
today
for
example
you
can
use
