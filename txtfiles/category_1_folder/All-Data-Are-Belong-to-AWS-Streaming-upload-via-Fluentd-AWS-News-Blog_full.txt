a

for

kiyoto
tamura
of

connector_data_1

a
really
interest
guest
to
introduce
you
to

to
show
you
how
you
can
use
it
with
a

connector_data_1
storage
be
cheap
connector_data_1
collection
be
not
connector_data_1
storage
have
become
incredibly
cheap
when
i
say
cheap
i
do
not
mean
in
term
of
hardware
but
operational
labor
cost
thanks
to
the
advent
of
iaa
technology_1
many
of
u
no
long
spend
day
and
week
on
capacity
plan
or
quality_attribute_2
yet
can
provision
resource
in
an
auto
quality_attribute_3
manner
or
worry
about
our
component_7
rack
catch
fire
cheap
storage
mean
that
our
idea
be
no
long
bind
by
how
much
connector_data_1
we
can
component_5
a
handful
of
engineer
can
run
a
dozen
or
so
technology_5
instance
or
manage
hundred
of
billion
of
requirement_6
connector_data_1
back
up
in
quality_attribute_4
storage
component_8

technology_6
to
power
their
daily
emr
pattern_2

analyze
massive
datasets
be
no
long
a
privilege
exclusive
to
big
tech
savvy
requirement_14
however
connector_data_1
collection
be
still
a
major
challenge
connector_data_1
do
not
magically
originate
inside
storage
component_9
or
organize
themselves
hence
many

hoc
script
be
connector_6
to
requirement_15
and
load
connector_data_1
these
script
be
brittle
error
prone
and
near
impossible
to
extend
this
be
the
problem
fluentd
try
to
solve
quality_attribute_3
quality_attribute_5
connector_data_1
collection
in
real
time
in
the
rest
of
this

i
will
walk
through
the
basic
architecture
of
fluentd
and
connector_4
some
use
requirement_16
on
technology_1
fluentd
open_source
connector_data_1
collector
for
high
volume
connector_data_1
connector_8
fluentd
be
an
open_source
connector_data_1
collector
originally
connector_6
at
treasure
connector_data_1
open
component_10
in

it
have
gain
traction
steadily
over
the
last


year
today
we
have
a
thrive
of
~50
contributor
and

100+
stargazer
on
technology_7
with
requirement_14
slideshare
and
nintendo
quality_attribute_6
it
in
production
input
and
output
at
the
high
level
fluentd
consist
of
input
and
output
input
specify
how
and
where
fluentd
ingest
connector_data_1
life
of
a
fluentd
from
kiyoto
tamura
common
input
be
tail
requirement_6
and
requirement_15
each
line
or
multiple
line
at
a
time
listen
to
syslog
connector_data_3
connector_9
technology_8
connector_data_4
and
requirement_15
the
connector_data_3
body
there
be
two
key
feature
about
input
technology_9
and
tag
fluentd
embrace
technology_9
a
it
core
connector_data_1
technology_10
and
each
input
be
responsible
for
turn
incoming
connector_data_1
into
a
series
of
technology_9
“events
”
each
input
give
a
tag
to
the
connector_data_1
it
ingest
base
on
the
tag
fluentd
decide
what
to
do
with
connector_data_1
come
from
different
input
see
below
once
connector_data_1
flow
into
fluentd
via
input
fluentd
look
at
each
event’s
tag
a
explain
in

above
and
connector_10
it
to
output
target
such
a
a
local
filesystem
rdbmss
technology_11
component_3
and
technology_2
component_8
open
and
pluggable
architecture
how
do
fluentd
have
so
many
input
and
output
already
the
secret
be
it
open
pluggable
architecture
with
a
minimal
knowledge
of
technology_12
one
can
build
a
plugin
in
a
matter
of
few
hour
unsurprisingly
many
fluentd
component_11
be
also
technology_2
enthusiast
so
we
already
have
plugins
for
the
follow
technology_2
component_8
quality_attribute_4
storage
component_8

technology_6
output
technology_5
output
quality_attribute_4
component_12
component_8
sqs
input
and
output
kinesis
output
technology_13
output
cloudwatch
input
requirement_17
and
quality_attribute_7
whenever
i
“confess”
that
fluentd
be
mostly
connector_6
in
technology_12
people
express
concern
about
requirement_17
fear
not
fluentd
be
plenty
fast
on
a
modern
component_7
it
can
component_6
~15


sec
on
a
single
core
and
you
can
connector_5
quality_attribute_2
quality_attribute_8
by
run
fluentd
on
multiple
core
fluentd
connector_11
it
quality_attribute_9
from
use
lower
level
technology_14
connector_6
in
technology_15
for
requirement_17
critical
part
of
the

for
example
fluentd
us
cool
io
maintain
by
masahiro
nakagawa
the
maintainer
of
fluentd
for
loop
and
technology_16
for
technology_17
maintain
by
sadayuki
furuhashi
the
original
author
of
fluentd
for
internal
connector_data_1
technology_10
quality_attribute_9
be
nice
but
quality_attribute_7
be
a
must
for
requirement_6
collection
connector_data_1
loss
lead
to
bad
connector_data_1
and
bad
decision
fluentd
ensure
quality_attribute_7
through
buffer
output
plugins
can
be
configure
to
buffer
it
connector_data_1
either
in
memory
or
on
disk
so
that
if
connector_data_1
transfer
fail
it
can
be
retry
without
connector_data_1
loss
the
buffer
component_13
be
highly
tunable
and
can
be
customize
for
various
quality_attribute_8
quality_attribute_10
requirement
example
archive
technology_18
requirement_6
into
technology_6
now
that
i’ve
give
an
overview
of
fluentd’s
feature
let’s
dive
into
an
example
we
will
show
you
how
to
set
up
fluentd
to
archive
technology_18
web
component_7
requirement_6
into
technology_6
step

connector_3
fluentd
fluentd
be
quality_attribute_11
a
a
technology_17
gem
gem
install
fluentd
also
treasure
connector_data_1
package
it
with
all
the
connector_12
a
td
agent
here
we
proceed
with
td
agent
i
assume
that
you
be
on
ubuntu
precise


but
td
agent
be
also
quality_attribute_11
for
ubuntu
lucid
and
centos


with
the
support
for
ubuntu
trusty
forthcoming
run
the
follow
command
curl
l
technology_8
toolbelt
treasuredata
technology_19
sh
install
ubuntu
precise
sh
|
sh
you
can
connector_13
that
td
agent
be
successfully
instal
by
run
the
follow
command
$
which
td
agent
usr
sbin
td
agent
step

configure
input
and
output
for
td
agent
the
configuration
be
locate
at
etc
td
agent
td
agent
conf
let’s
reconfigure
it
so
that
it
tail
the
technology_18
requirement_6

type
tail
technology_10
technology_20
path
var
requirement_6
technology_20
access_log
pos_file
var
requirement_6
td
agent
technology_20
access_log
po
tag
technology_6
technology_18
connector_14
this
snippet
configure
the
technology_18
requirement_6
input
it
tell
fluentd
to
tail
the
requirement_6
locate
at
var
requirement_6
technology_20
access_log
requirement_15
it
accord
to
the
technology_18
combine
requirement_6
technology_10
and
tag
it
a
technology_6
technology_18
connector_14
next
we
configure
the
technology_6
output
a
follow
type
technology_6
s3_bucket
your_bucket_name
path
requirement_6
buffer_path
var
requirement_6
td
agent
technology_6
time_slice_format

utc
format_json
true
include_time_key
true
include_tag_key
true
buffer_chunk_limit
256m
the
match
technology_6
*
*
tell
fluentd
to
match
any
whose
tag
have

three
part
and

start
with
technology_6
since
all
the
come
from
the
technology_18
connector_14
requirement_6
have
the
tag
technology_6
technology_18
connector_14
it
connector_11
match
here
and
connector_15
to
technology_6
finally
let’s
start
td
agent
with
the
update
configuration
$
sudo
component_8
td
agent
start
*
start
td
agent
td
agent
ok
it
might
take
about

minute
for
your
connector_data_1
to
appear
in
technology_6
due
to
buffer
see
“time_slice_wait”
but
eventually
requirement_6
should
appear
in
your_bucket_name
requirement_6
yyyymmddhh
also
make
sure
that
fluentd
have
connector_6
connector_14
to
your
technology_6
bucket
the
follow
set
should
be
use
for
iam

next
the
above
overview
and

give
you
