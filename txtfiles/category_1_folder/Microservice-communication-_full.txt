proceduresan
pattern_6
be
useful
for
work
with
a
narrow
pattern_9
of
the
connector_data_2
this
reduce
the
bandwidth
you
use
on
the
requirement_2
and
simplify
the
component_1
you
can
be
a
specific
or
a
narrow
a
you
want
a
long
a
it
do
what
you
need
what
be
nice
about
pattern_6
be
that
you
have
a
way
of
create
component_9
that
do
one
well
grpc
by
and
square
represent
an
incremental
step
in
the
progress
of
quality_attribute_7
pattern_6
for
requirement_7
solution
grpc
can
use
technology_6
buffer
for
connector_data_2
serialization
this
make
connector_data_9
fast
small
and
quality_attribute_6
rest
grpc
can
be
use
cross
technology_7
which
mean
that
if
you
have
connector_21
a
web
component_1
in
golang
a
technology_8
connector_21
component_5
can
still
use
that
web
component_1
which
make
grpc
web
component_9
very
quality_attribute_8
grpc
run
on
top
of
technology_9
which
mean
it
outsource
the
problem
of
connector_6
requirement_8
and
quality_attribute_9
connector_22
the
connector_data_5
and
connector_data_10
connector_data_11
of
arbitrary
size
second
grpc
actually
run
on
top
of
a
quality_attribute_1
version
of
technology_9
connector_20
transport
pattern_8
quality_attribute_10
tl
mean
it
outsource
responsibility
for
quality_attribute_1
the
connector_1
pattern_10
grpc
actually
actually
run
on
top
of
technology_1
which
be
itself
pattern_8
on
top
of
technology_9
and
tl
mean
grpc
outsource
yet
two
other
problem

compress
binary
connector_data_2
into
a
connector_data_8
multiplexing
multiple
remote
connector_data_7
onto
a
single
technology_9
connector_6
it
make
use
of
binary
connector_data_2
rather
than
text
which
make
the
connector_1
more
compact
and
more
efficientit
be
also
type
quality_attribute_11
this
basically
mean
that
you
can’t
give
an
apple
while
a
banana
be
expect
when
the
component_10
expect
an
grpc
won’t
allow
you
to
connector_23
a
because
these
be
two
different
type
workflow
with
grpc
be
quite
quality_attribute_6
first
you
need
to
define
proto
define
component_1
connector_data_12
and
connector_14
technology_10
and
then
you
copy
this
to
all
project
which
will
connector_3
with
each
other
the
only
thing
you
need
to
do
be
to
convert
your
domain
connector_data_13
to
the
generate
technology_6
buffer
be
use
to
define
schema
technology_6
buffer
or
technology_11
be
a
way
of
define
and
serialize
pattern_11
connector_data_2
into
an
quality_attribute_12
binary
technology_10
also
develop
by
technology_6
buffer
be
one
of
the
reason
we
choose
grpc
a
the
two
work
very
well
together
we
previously
have
many
issue
relate
to
versioning
that
we
want
to
fix
pattern_2
mean
we
have
to
roll
connector_24
and
connector_data_14
constantly
and
so
we
need
that
can
adapt
and
stay
connector_25
and
backwards
quality_attribute_13
and
technology_11
be
very
quality_attribute_14
for
this
since
they
be
in
a
binary
technology_10
they
be
also
small
connector_data_9
that
be
quick
to
connector_23
over
the
wire
pro
fast
because
of
binary

by
many

you
can

a

it’s

advantage
you

if

you
can
still
operate

need
to
set
up
a
technology_15
clusterconclusion
for
a
pattern_7
you
must
treat
it
a
resource
that
provide
domain
connector_data_2
the
reward
be
you
be
now
segregate
connector_data_2
into
separate
domain
this
make
it
useful
for
when
you
have
any
number
of
component_20
connector_data_5
connector_data_2
this
approach
attempt
to
decouple
connector_data_2
from
component_5
or
requirement_9
component_21
if
you
ever
need
to
break
up
component_1
into
two
quality_attribute_6
component_1
but
you
t
want
to
completely
connector_29
how
the
different
part
connector_8
do
not
hesitate
to
reach
out
for
an
pattern_6
solution
or
if
requirement_10
be
paramount
and
you
want
the
option
to
use
many
different
technology_7
go
for
either
grpc
pattern_6
style
be
great
when
you
want
only
one
do
well
this
make
it
useful
for
one
or
two
component_22
component_6
because
it
be
a
niche
component_1
pattern_6
can
connector_13
requirement_9
component_21
inside
the
component_1
give
that
it
only
do
one
thing
this
quality_attribute_16
and
clarity
to
the
component_1
however
the
loosely
couple
highly
quality_attribute_8
nature
of
pattern_5
connector_data_8
base
component_23
fit
well
with
the
overall
ethos
of
pattern_2
more
often
than
not
despite
some
significant
design
and
implementation
hurdle
an
pattern_15
pattern_16
approach
would
be
a
quality_attribute_14
choice
when
decide
upon
a
default
connector_1
mechanism
in
a
pattern_2
base
component_16
so
which
connector_1
approach
be
best
when
design
your
pattern_2
it
quality_attribute_5
on
the
requirement
rest
pattern_6
and
connector_data_8
drive
be
not
mutually
exclusive
they
can
all
work
together
in
your
pattern_1
architecture
every
successful
requirement_7
base
tech
requirement_11
employ
these
connector_1
style
effectively
to
some
degree
we
have
cover
the
different
requirement_5
and
circumstance
in
which
each
style
come
into
play
and
where
each
be
appropriate
when
choose
either
approach
or
style
it
be
key
to
the
difference
there
be
no
right
or
wrong
here
what
be
more
important
be
to
which
approach
solve
for
the
at
hand
there
be
a
lot
of
option
however
you
don’t
need
to
make
a
single
choice
for
connector_1
between
all
of
your
component_1
generally
what
to
choose
when
if
you
need
to
connector_3
ui

with
your
component_1
—
choose

you
need
to
provide

—
choose

you
need

—
try
to
component_17
your

use

if

possible
then
choose

drive
if
you

with
high
volume
of

consider
adopt

if

saturation
to

then
this
