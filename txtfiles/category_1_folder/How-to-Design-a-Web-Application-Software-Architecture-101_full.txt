you’ve
embark
on
the
entrepreneurial
journey
to
build
your
own
web
component_1
you’ve
connector_1
the
idea
in
place
but
the
significance
of
connector_2
the
architecture
right
be
extremely
important
the
goal
of
this
coding_keyword_1
be
to
give
you
a
solid
understand
of
web
architecture
the
concept
involve
and
how
to
pick
the
right
architecture
and
technology_1
when
design
your
component_2
by
the
end
of
this
coding_keyword_1
when
you
go
to
design
an
component_1
from
the
bare
bone
you
won’t
be
sit
in
the
dark
anymore
we’ll
walk
through
these
key
area
what
be
architecture
why
be
architecture
important
the
difference
between
architecture
and
design
architecture
pattern_1
how
to
decide
on
the
number
of
tier
your
component_2
should
have
horizontal
or
vertical
scaling…
which
be
right
for
my
component_2
monolith
or
pattern_2
when
should
you
use
technology_2
or
technology_3
pick
the
right
technology_1
for
the
how
to
become
a
architect
where
to
go
from
here
web
component_1
&
architecture
from
scratch
this
be
a

on
web
component_1
&
architecture
it
walk
you
step
by
step
through
different
component_3
involve
in
design
the
architecture
of
a
web
component_2
web
component_1
&
architecture

what
be
architecture
architecture
of
a
component_4
describe
it
major
component_5
their
relationship
and
how
they
connector_3
with
each
other
it
essentially
serve
a
a
blueprint
it
provide
an
abstraction
to
manage
the
component_4
complexity
and
establish
connector_4
and
coordination
among
component_5
here
be
some
key
point
the
architecture
help
define
a
solution
to
meet
all
the
technical
and
operational
requirement
with
the
common
goal
of
optimize
for
requirement_2
and
quality_attribute_1
design
the
architecture
involve
the
intersection
of
the
organization’s
need
a
well
a
the
need
of
the
development
team
each
decision
can
have
a
considerable
impact
on
quality
quality_attribute_2
requirement_2
etc
one
of
my
favorite
definition
of
architecture
come
from
ralph
johnson
co
author
of
design
pattern_1
element
of
quality_attribute_3
connector_data_1
orient

he
state
that
it’s
the
decision
you
wish
you
could
connector_1
right
early
in
a
project
so
with
that
say
let’s
move
on
to
why
architecture
be
important
why
be
architecture
important
the
key
element
in
successfully
create
anything
be
connector_2
the
base
right
now
whether
it
be
construct
a
build
or
make
a
pizza
if
we
don’t
connector_1
the
base
right
we
have
to
start
over
there
be
no
other
way
around
build
a
web
component_1
be
no
different
the
architecture
be
it
base
and
have
to
be
carefully
think
out
to
avoid
any
major
design
connector_5
&
refactoring
at
a
late
point
in
time
many
engineer
will
tell
you
that
you
don’t
want
to
delve
into
re
design
stuff
it
eat
up
your
time
a
black
hole
it
have
the
potential
to
connector_6
your
ship
date
further
down
the
calendar
by
month
if
not
long
and
that’s
not
even
bring
up
the
wastage
of
engineering
and
financial
resource
which
be
cause
due
to
this
it
also
quality_attribute_4
on
what
stage
of
the
development
component_6
we
hit
an
impasse
due
to
the
hasty
decision
take
during
the
initial
design
phase
so
before
we
even
touch
the
and
connector_1
our
hand
dirty
we
have
to
make
the
underlie
architecture
right
though
development
be
an
iterative
and
evolutionary
component_6
we
don’t
always
connector_1
thing
perfect
at
the
first
go
still
this
can’t
be
an
excuse
for
not
do
our
homework
the
difference
between
architecture
and
design
there
be
often
confusion
between
design
and
architecture
so
we’ll
break
this
down
architecture
be
use
to
define
the
skeleton
and
the
high
level
component_3
of
a
component_4
and
how
they
will
all
work
together
for
example
do
you
need
serverless
architecture
which
split
the
component_1
into
two
component_5
baa
backend
a
a
component_7
and
faa

a
a
component_7
or
do
you
need
something
a
pattern_2
architecture
where
the
different
feature
connector_data_2
be
split
into
separate
respective

codebases
choose
an
architecture
will
determine
how
you
deal
with
requirement_2
fault
tolerance
quality_attribute_5
and
quality_attribute_6
design
be
responsible
for
the
level
design
such
a
what
each
be
do
the
scope
and
the
purpose
etc
when
use
strategically
they
can
make
a
programmer
significantly
more
quality_attribute_7
by
allow
them
to
avoid
reinvent
the
wheel
instead
use
refine
by
others
already
they
also
provide
a
useful
common
technology_4
to
conceptualize
repeat
problem
and
solution
when
discuss
with
others
or
manage
in
large
team
here
be
a
quality_attribute_8
on
understand
the
importance
of
design
and
the
try
and
true

frequently

the
absence
of

rule
out
the
possibility
of

so
even
if
some

arise
in

a
limit
number
of

when
multiple
component_9

increase
component_1
requirement_2
can
slow
down
due
to
the
fact
that
component_22
necessitate
separate
connector_10
and
cpu
memory
to
proceed
since
the
component_1
component_13
be

with
the

it’s
difficult
to
re
use

pro
connector_data_6
corruption
through

component_18
can
be
eliminate
a
the

updations
ensure
it

the
placement
of
the

component_13
on
a
centralized
component_10
make
the
connector_data_6
more
quality_attribute_16
due
to
the
quality_attribute_12
deployment
of
component_1
component_10
quality_attribute_5
of
the
component_4
be
enhance
since
a
separate
connector_10
from
each
component_9
be
not
require
whereas
connector_10
from
few
component_1
component_23
be
sufficient
con
usually
more
effort
should
be
enforce
when
create

tier
component_18
a
the
connector_4
point
be
increase
component_9
to
middle
tier
to
component_10
instead
of
directly
component_9
to
component_10
and
the
requirement_2
increase
by
technology_9
visua_basic
powerbuilder
technology_10
will
be
reduce
n
tier
component_1
pro
all
the
pro
of
three
tier
architecture
the
requirement_2
be
increase
due
to
off
load
from
the
component_16
tier
and
the
component_9
tier
enabling
it
to
suit
to
high
volume
requirement_7
con
due
to
the
componentization
of
the
tier
the
complex
connector_data_7
be
difficult
to
connector_12
or
maintain
conclusion
you
should
choose
a
single
tier
architecture
when
you
do
not
want
any
requirement_3
quality_attribute_13
choose
a
two
tier
component_1
when
you
need
to
minimize
requirement_3
quality_attribute_13
and
you
need
more
control
of
connector_data_6
within
your
component_1
you
should
choose
a
three
tier
architecture
when
you
need
control
over
the

requirement_6
component_13
of
your
component_1
&
want
it
to
be
quality_attribute_16
and
you
need
control
over
connector_data_6
in
your
component_1
you
should
choose
a
n
tier
architecture
when
you
need
your
component_1
to
quality_attribute_10
and
handle
large
amount
of
connector_data_6
horizontal
or
vertical
scaling…
which
be
right
for
my
component_2
if
your
component_2
be
a
utility
or
a
technology_9
which
be
expect
to
connector_13
minimal
consistent
traffic
it
not
be
mission
critical
for
instance
an
internal
technology_9
of
an
organization
or
something
similar
why
bother
component_24
it
in
a
quality_attribute_12
environment
a
single
component_10
be
enough
to
manage
the
traffic
so
you
could
go
with
vertical
quality_attribute_17
when
you
that
the
traffic
load
would
not
increase
significantly
if
your
component_2
be
a
coding_keyword_2
face
social
component_2
a
social
requirement_3
a
fitness
component_2
or
something
similar
then
the
traffic
be
expect
to
spike
exponentially
in
the
near
future
in
this
requirement_8
both
high
quality_attribute_18
and
horizontal
quality_attribute_5
be
important
to
you
build
to
quality_attribute_19
it
on
the
requirement_9
&
always
have
horizontal
quality_attribute_5
in
mind
right
from
the
start
here
be
a
quality_attribute_8
for

more
about
quality_attribute_5
monolith
or
pattern_2
let’s
explore
when
you
should
choose
one
over
the
other
when
to
use
monolithic
architecture
monolithic
component_18
fit
best
for
use
requirement_8
where
the
requirement
be
pretty
quality_attribute_20
the
component_2
be
expect
to
handle
a
limit
amount
of
traffic
one
example
of
this
be
an
internal
tax
calculation
component_2
of
an
organization
or
a
similar
open
coding_keyword_2
technology_9
these
be
the
use
requirement_8
where
the
requirement_6
be
certain
that
there
won’t
be
an
exponential
growth
in
the
component_17
base
and
the
traffic
over
time
there
be
also
instance
where
the
dev
team
decide
to
start
with
a
monolithic
architecture
and
late
quality_attribute_10
out
to
a
quality_attribute_12
pattern_10
architecture
when
to
use
pattern_2
architecture
the
pattern_2
architecture
fit
best
for
complex
use
requirement_8
and
for
component_25
which
expect
traffic
to
increase
exponentially
in
future
a
fancy
social
requirement_3
component_1
a
typical
social
requirement_3
component_1
have
various
component_3
such
a
connector_data_10
real
time
chat
live
video
connector_14
image
connector_15

connector_16
feature
etc
in
this
scenario
i
would
suggest
develop
each
component_5
separately
keep
the
single
responsibility
and
the
separation
of
concern
principle
in
mind
connector_17
every
feature
in
a
single
codebase
would
take
no
time
in
become
a
mess
so
by
now
in
the
component_26
of
monolithic
and
pattern_10
we
have
go
through
three
approach
pick
a
monolithic
architecture
pick
a
pattern_2
architecture
start
with
a
monolithic
architecture
and
then
late
quality_attribute_10
out
into
a
pattern_2
architecture
pick
a
monolithic
or
a
pattern_2
architecture
largely
quality_attribute_4
on
our
use
requirement_8
i’ll
suggest
keep
thing
quality_attribute_20
have
a
thorough
understand
of
the
requirement
connector_1
the
lay
of
the
land
build
something
only
when
you
need
it
&
keep
quality_attribute_21
the
iteratively
this
be
the
right
way
to
go
when
should
you
use
technology_2
or
technology_3
when
to
pick
a
technology_11
component_16
if
you
be
connector_17
a
requirement_10
requirement_11
bank
or
a
finance
base
component_2
or
you
need
to
component_15
a
lot
of
relationship
for
instance
when
connector_17
a
social
requirement_3
component_2

then
you
should
pick
a
relational
component_16
here’s
why
transaction
&
connector_data_6
consistency
if
you
be
connector_17
which
have
anything
to
do
with
money
or
number
that
make
transaction
acid
connector_data_6
consistency
super
important
to
you
relational
db
shine
when
it
come
to
transaction
&
connector_data_6
consistency
they
comply
with
the
acid
rule
have
be
around
for
age
&
be
battle
test
connector_18
relationship
if
your
connector_data_6
have
a
lot
of
relationship
which
friend
of
yours
live
in
a
particular
city
which
of
your
friend
already
eat
at
the
restaurant
you
plan
to
visit
today
etc
there
be
nothing
quality_attribute_8
than
a
relational
component_16
for
connector_18
this
kind
of
connector_data_6
relational
component_16
be
build
to
component_15
relationship
they
have
be
try
&
test
&
be
use
by
big
gun
in
the
requirement_7
a
the
coding_keyword_3
component_17
face
component_16
popular
relational
component_16
technology_12
technology_11
component_10
technology_13
technology_14
when
to
pick
a
technology_2
component_16
here
be
a
few
reason
why
you’d
want
to
pick
a
technology_2
component_16
handle
a
large

also
fit

how
to
become
a
architect
if
this
all
sound
interest
then
you
aspire
to
be
a
architect
but
where
do
you
start
well
it’s
extremely
uncommon
for
someone
to
start
out
a
a
architect
so
most
engineer
work
for
a
few
year
before
they
take
on
design
architecture
one
of
the
best
way
to
become
familiar
with
architecture
be
by
design
your
own
web
component_1
this
will
force
you
to
think
through
all
the
different
aspect
of
your
component_1
from
load
balance
connector_data_10
component_31
connector_14
component_6
pattern_19
and
more
once
you
start
to
understand
how
these
concept
fit
into
your
component_2
you’ll
be
well
on
your
way
to
become
a
architect
a
an
aspire
architect
you
need
to
constantly
expand
your
knowledge
and
stay
on
top
of
the
late
requirement_7
trend
you
start
by

one
or
more
programming
technology_4
work
a
a
developer
and
gradually
make
your
way
where
to
go
from
here
while
there
be
a
lot
cover
in
this
coding_keyword_1
we’ve
merely
touch
the
surface
on
this
topic
we
still
have
yet
to
explore
pattern_20
apis
high
quality_attribute_18
and
cap
theorem
if
you’d
a
deep
dive
into
architecture
i
highly
recommend
web
component_1
and
architecture

it
walk
you
step
by
step
through
different
component_3
&
concept
involve
when
design
the
architecture
of
a
web
component_1
you’ll
about
various
architectural
style
such
a
the
component_9
component_10
peer
to
peer
decentralized
architecture
pattern_10
the
fundamental
of
connector_data_6
flow
in
a
web
component_1
different
pattern_14
involve
concept
quality_attribute_5
high
quality_attribute_18
and
much
more
it
will
also
help
you
with
the
engineering

especially
for
the
full
technology_37
developer
position
happy

keep
connector_23
about
architecture

architecture

all
you
need
