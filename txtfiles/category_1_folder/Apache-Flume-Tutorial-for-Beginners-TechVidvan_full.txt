for
a

for
technology_1

this
be
the
right
place
for
you
this
technology_1
technology_2
will
provide
you
the
complete
guide
for
technology_1
technology_4
in
this

you
will
what
technology_1
technology_2
be
why
we
use
it
and
many
more
technology_1
technology_2
be
a
technology_5
use
to
transfer
connector_data_1
from
different
component_1
to
the
technology_3
quality_attribute_1
component_2
the
will
cover
all
the
basic
concept
relate
to
technology_4
keep
you
update
with
late
technology_6
trend
join
techvidvan
on
telegramwhat
be
technology_1
technology_4
technology_4
be
an
open
component_3
quality_attribute_1
and
quality_attribute_2
component_2
design
for
connector_1
aggregate
and
transfer
huge
volume
of
requirement_1
connector_data_1
from
various
different
component_1
to
the
centralized
pattern_1
the
centralized
pattern_1
can
be
technology_7
technology_8
etc
if
we
want
to
transfer
social

generate
connector_data_1
connector_data_2
requirement_1
connector_data_1
to
technology_3
then
we
use
technology_1
technology_4
it
be
the
top
level
project
at
technology_1
foundation
the
purpose
of
design
technology_1
technology_2
be
to
copy
the
connector_2
connector_data_1
requirement_1
connector_data_1
from
different
web
component_4
to
technology_7
why
technology_1
technology_4
since
we
all
that
million
of
component_5
of
a
requirement_2
be
run
on
multiple
component_6
these
component_4
produce
lot
of
requirement_1
with
the
advent
of
requirement_3
technology_6
that
be
technology_1
technology_3
requirement_2
want
to
analyze
these
requirement_1
to
generate
insight
requirement_4
want
to
analyze
these
requirement_1
connector_data_1
to
understand
their
requirement_5
behavior
so
for
component_7
requirement_1
they
require
a
quality_attribute_3
and
quality_attribute_2
quality_attribute_1
connector_data_1
collection
component_8
this
component_8
must
be
capable
of
transfer
requirement_1
from
their
web
component_4
to
the
component_2
which
can
component_9
and
component_7
these
requirement_1
such
a
technology_7
here
technology_1
technology_2
come
into
the
picture
it
be
an
open
component_3
quality_attribute_1
connector_data_1
collection
component_8
that
we
can
use
for
connector_data_1
transfer
from
component_3
to
destination
technology_4
be
a
highly
quality_attribute_4
component_8
use
for
connector_1
aggregate
and
transport
massive
amount
of
requirement_1
into
the
technology_7
it
have
tunable

mechanism
for
fail

feature
of

it
be

component_8

technology_1
technology_2
have
tunable
quality_attribute_5
mechanism
for

it
provide
support
for
the

it
also

technology_2
support
large

we
can
use
technology_1
technology_2
for
efficiently
ingest
requirement_1
connector_data_1
from
other
component_4
into
the
centralized
connector_data_1
component_9

technology_1

allow
u
to

component_4
in

a

we
can
easily
move

connector_data_1
into
the
technology_3
quality_attribute_1
component_2
through

technology_2
offer
steady
connector_data_1
flow
between
the
connector_6
