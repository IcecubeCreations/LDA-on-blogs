of
connector_1
connector_data_1
architecture
and
why
technology_1
technology_2
have
become
so
popularthe
term
‘big_data’
contain
more
than
it
reference
to
quantity
and
volume
live
in
the
era
of
readily
quality_attribute_1
connector_data_2
and
instantaneous
connector_2
it
be
not
surprise
that
connector_data_1
architecture
have
be
shift
to
be
connector_3
orient
real
requirement_1
for
requirement_2
doesn’t
come
from
sit
on
a
gargantuan
amount
of
connector_4
connector_data_1
point
but
also
from
their
ability
to
extract
actionable
insight
a
quickly
a
possible
even
in
real
time
component_1
connector_data_1
at
fast
rat
allow
a
requirement_2
to
technology_3
to
connector_5
requirement_3
condition
in
real
time
it
go
without
say
that
over
the
last
decade
there
have
be
a
constant
growth
for
component_2
aka
connector_data_3
pattern_1

capable
of
capture
retain
and
component_1
this
overwhelmingly
rapid
flow
of
connector_data_2
a
of

technology_1
technology_2
be
one
of
the
most
widely
adopt
connector_data_3
pattern_1
use
by
the

of
netflix
uber
airbnb
and
linkedin
to
accomplish
these
connector_data_4
this
will
give
a
very
brief
overview
of
the
concept
of
connector_3
component_1
connector_1
connector_data_1
architecture
and
why
technology_1
technology_2
have
gain
so
much
momentum

connector_3
component_1
be
best
visualise
a
a
river
in
the
same
way
that
water
flow
through
a
river
so
do
package
of
connector_data_2
in
the
endless
flow
of
connector_3
component_1
accord
to
technology_4
the
general
definition
of
connector_1
connector_data_1
would
be
“data
that
be
generate
continuously
by
thousand
of
connector_data_1
component_3
which
typically
connector_6
in
the
connector_data_1
component_4
simultaneously
and
in
small
size
order
of
kilobyte
”
connector_data_1
connector_1
work
particularly
well
in
time
series
in
order
to
find
underlie
pattern_2
over
time
it
also
really
shin
in
the
iot
space
where
different
connector_data_1
signal
can
be
constantly
connector_4
other
common
us
be
find
on
web
connector_7
e
commerce
transaction
requirement_4
geolocation
point
and
much
much
more
there
be
a
subtle
difference
between
real
time
component_1
and
connector_3
component_1
real
time
component_1
imply
a
hard
deadline
in
term
of
connector_data_1
component_1
in
other
word
time
be
very
relevant
and
quality_attribute_2
in
the
order
of
a
second
be
unacceptable
connector_3
component_1
refer
more
to
a
of
computation
in
a
continuous
flow
of
connector_data_1
an
component_5
printing
out
of
all
the

create
in
the
last
day
doesn’t
really
have
constraint
in
term
of
time
however
the
long
term
output
rate
should
be
fast
or
at
least
equal
to
the
long
term
input
rate
otherwise
component_6
storage
requirement
would
have
to
be
indefinitely
large
the
connector_1
connector_data_1
architecturethe
canonic
connector_1
connector_data_1
architecture
be
compose
of

fundamental
block
connector_data_3
pattern_1
it
connector_8
connector_1
connector_data_1
from
so
connector_data_5
component_7
component_8
can
track
any
range
from
metric
clickstreams
search
and
etc
all
these
action
be
then
component_9
into
the
atomic
build
block
of
the
technology_1
technology_2
architecture
namely
topic
and
component_10
one
of
the
key
strength
of
technology_2
be
it
ability
to
parallelise
component_10
in
order
to
increase
the
overall
quality_attribute_3
the
connector_data_2
be
then
make
quality_attribute_1
to
component_11
which
will

of

use
component_13
to
perform
these
connector_data_6
would
be

such
a
technology_8

others
the
outcome

stage
could
be

connector_data_1
storage
and
analysisafter
the
connector_data_1
be
prepare
by
our
connector_data_1
connector_3
processor
we
have
to
component_9
it
analyse
it
in
order
to
provide
valuable
insight
such
a
vast
amount
of
connector_data_1
can
be
either
component_9
in
cheap
connector_data_1
lake
technology_9
at
the
expense
of
quality_attribute_2
and
technology_10

or
in
connector_data_1
requirement_5
technology_11
and
technology_12
which
be
hard
to
manage
compare
to
connector_data_1
lake
but
also
more
pattern_3
alternatively
they
can
also
be
component_9
on
the
memory
of
the
connector_data_3
pattern_1
itself
for
example
technology_2
but
this
be
10x
more
expensive
than
the
connector_data_1
lake
counterpart
why
be
technology_2
connector_9
so
much
attention
to
understand
quality_attribute_4
how
pattern_4
come
to
be
let’s
have
a
brief
look
at
how
the
connector_data_1
component_1
look
before
technology_1
technology_2
all
connector_data_1
be
previously
component_9
in
a
component_15
or
a
quality_attribute_5
component_6
which
would
be
periodically

hour

day
etc
be
analyse
and
operate
on
even
though
this
component_16
have
work
for
a
long
time
and
it
still
have
many
component_5
it
have
also
a
fundamental
flaw
it
simply
cannot
analyse
connector_data_1
on
the
fly
in
a
world
where
connector_data_1
requirement_1
quickly
decrease
over
time
connector_3
component_1
be
all
about
ingest
and
analyse
a
flow
of
and
a
we
saw
early
the
technology_13
responsible
for
the
fetch
be
make
up
of
our
connector_data_3
pattern_1
which
be
able
to
take
in
all
these
connector_data_1
signal
and
make
them
almost
immediately
quality_attribute_1
however
create
a
super
quality_attribute_6
component_6
many
to
many
component_7
to
component_17
be
no
easy
connector_data_4
and
it
be
exactly
what
linkedin
have
to
face
in

when
they
start
work
on
technology_2
one
of
the
issue
be
how
the
component_7
should
pass
the
connector_data_2
directly
to
each
component_17
in
private
component_18
and
how
could
component_11
connector_10
this
connector_data_1
while
it
be
be
connector_11
by
component_7
linkedin’s
project
which
will
become
late
on
technology_1
technology_2
solve
for
this
issue
and
provide
a
quality_attribute_5
component_13
that
be
able
to
component_1
connector_3
component_4
a
they
occur
it
basically
become
the
technology_13
of
modern
connector_3
component_1
and
it
be
so
successful
that
other
requirement_2
create
their
counterpart
such
a
kinesis
and
technology_14
hub
the
heart
of
it
popularity
come
from
the
introduction
of
a
component_6
that
it’s
requirement_4
orient
a
oppose
to
the
pattern_5
connector_data_7
previously
adopt
the
requirement_4
be
time
order
and
append
only
series
of
from
which
component_11
can
extract
connector_data_2
at
any
time
example
of
connector_data_1
in
the
requirement_4
come
from
a
shop
cart
could
be
item
delete
item
checkout
etc
in
technology_2
connector_data_8
be
connector_11
on
topic
which
maintain
it
requirement_4
and
from
which
component_11
can
extract
the
connector_data_1
image

official
technology_1
technology_2
append
only
requirement_4
structureeven
though
connector_data_3
pattern_1
such
a
rabbit_mq
and
technology_15
have
be
around
for
year
even
before
technology_2
the
requirement_4
append
connector_data_9
have
allow
for
the
component_1
of
an
insane
amount
of
transaction
in
technology_2
each
component_17
be
responsible
to
keep
track
of
their
activity
whereas
in
technology_5
they
have
to
behave
a
component_19
and
the
connector_data_3
pattern_1
itself
keep
track
of
the
component_17
activity
it
have
to
be
say
that
technology_2
do
not
make
previous
component_12
obsolete
and
they
be
still
applicable
to
other
architecture
where
they
be
simply
a
quality_attribute_4
fit
technology_2
provide
a

high
