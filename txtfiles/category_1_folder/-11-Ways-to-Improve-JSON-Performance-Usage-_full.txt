developer
tip

&
resource
insight
for
dev
manager
technology_1
be
easy
to
work
with
and
have
become
the
technology_13
connector_data_1
technology_14
for
virtually
everything
although
originally
derive
from
the
technology_15
script
technology_6
technology_1
be
now
a
technology_6
independent
connector_data_1
technology_14
and
for
requirement_4
and
generate
technology_1
connector_data_1
be
readily
quality_attribute_2
in
many
programming
technology_6
at
stackify
we
use
technology_1
extensively
for
pattern_2
apis
serialize
connector_data_2
to
component_4
and
much
more
we
have
compile
a
connector_data_3
of
some
common
technology_1
requirement_1
tip
while
we
use
technology_7
for
most
of
our
component_5
most
of
these
tip
apply
to
other
programming
technology_6
a
well
you
need
multiple
technology_1
technology_16
for
optimal
requirement_1
and
feature
in
technology_17
the
most
popular
technology_1
technology_16
be
technology_18
newtonsoft
but
servicestack
fastjsonparser
component_6
text
technology_19
and
even
the
build
in
datacontractjavascriptserializer
be
fast
or
provide
specific
feature
you
need
quality_attribute_3
on
the
scenario
this
be
base
on
my
own
test
and
i
encourage
you
to
do
the
same
if
you
do
a
lot
of
requirement_4
and
really
care
about
requirement_1
fastjsonparser
be
a
lot
fast
than
anything
else
i
have
try
i
highly
recommend
it
here
be
my
connector_data_4
from
do
some
quality_attribute_4
benchmark
from
a
test
component_7
pattern_3
on
technology_20
fast
serializer
servicestack
fast
requirement_5
fastjsonparser
overall
most
feature
and
quality_attribute_5
technology_18
i
haven’t
test
it
myself
but
i
have
also
hear
quality_attribute_6
thing
about
jil
which
be
design
entirely
for
quality_attribute_7
by
stackexchange’s
team
use
connector_1
whenever
possible
most
technology_1
requirement_4
technology_16
can
connector_2
straight
from
a
connector_3
instead
of
a
this
be
a
little
more
quality_attribute_8
and
prefer
where
possible
improve
requirement_1
use
technology_1
connector_4
compress
your
technology_1
since
technology_1
be
quality_attribute_4
text
you
can
expect
to
connector_5
up
to
90%
compression
so
use
gzip
wherever
possible
when
connector_6
with
your
web
component_5
avoid
requirement_4
technology_1
if
you
don’t
need
to
this
seem
obvious
but
it
necessarily
isn’t
for
web
component_8
that
connector_7
technology_1
and
simply
connector_8
it
to
a
component_4
component_9
or
other
storage
try
not
to
ever
requirement_4
the
technology_1
if
you
can
when
use
something
technology_17
web
technology_21
don’t
define
your
expect
specific
a
incoming
connector_data_1
and
instead
connector_2
the
body
so
technology_17
never
par
the
technology_19
for
stackify’s
component_10
we
use
requirement_6
for
pattern_4
so
in
some
scenario
we
never
even
need
to
analyze
the
body
of
the
connector_data_5
we
can
component_4
it
and
our
background
component_10
do
further
validation
of

keep

at
a
time
because
the
final
output
could
only
be
up
to
a
certain
size
to
component_4
we
be
able
to
do
some
optimization
of
this
component_11
and
it
make
a
pretty
significant
difference
in

cpu

use

~20%

they
basically
work

quality_attribute_3
on
your
use
requirement_3
it
could
be
slow
or
fast
to
do
this
i
experiment
with
use
technology_18
and
a
jsontextreader
to
improve
technology_1
requirement_1
but
find
that
it
still
didn’t
come
anywhere
close
to
be
a
fast
a
the
much
easy
to
use
fastjsonparser
this
find
be
pretty
amaze
to
me
have
you
consider
alternative
to
technology_19
technology_1
isn’t
the
solution
for
everything
connector_data_12
have
go
out
of
favor
a
technology_1
have
become
the
technology_13
but
quality_attribute_3
on
your
use
requirement_3
it
might
still
be
a
quality_attribute_6
fit
for
you
especially
if
you
want
to
enforce
a
strong
schema
another
option
be
technology_25
or
messagepack
which
be
type
of
binary
base
connector_data_9
serialization
the
only
big
downfall
be
they
aren’t
