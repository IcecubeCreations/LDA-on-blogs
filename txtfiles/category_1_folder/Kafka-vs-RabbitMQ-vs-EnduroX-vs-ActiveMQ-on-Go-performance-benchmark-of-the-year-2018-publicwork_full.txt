thus
the
be
fix
to
re
connector_7
in
requirement_3
of
component_3
error
conclusion
during
the
test
the
connector_data_3
show
that
enduro
x
show
quality_attribute_2
connector_data_3
with
pattern_1
style
connector_data_1
for
oneway
test
publish
only
technology_4
technology_1
be
the
best
but
downside
for
technology_1
be
that
connector_data_5
be
not
block
thus
“dirty”
solution
be
to
restart
the
connector_8
connector_data_7
to
the
component_8
while
the
enduro
x
no
“dirty
fixes”
be
need
a
when
the
component_8
be
full
the
component_5
block
and
wait
for
free
space
then
after
all
the
technology_3
with
go
stomp
component_3
be
also
show
quality_attribute_2
connector_data_3
when
connector_data_7
size
increase
but
the
downside
with
stomp
component_3
be
that
during
the
test
the
component_3
connector_4
disconnect
for
some
reason
technology_2
also
seem
to
be
quality_attribute_4
component_6
and
no
special
fix
be
need
to
connector_9
the
test
requirement_3
except
that
pattern_3
connector_6
must
be
use
to
connector_4
“blocked”
style
connector_data_1
technology_2
