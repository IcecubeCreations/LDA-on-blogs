nowadays
the
concept
of
pattern_1
be
more
than
a
quality_attribute_3
novelty
with
the
advent
of
devops
and
the
boom
of
container
technology_11
and
deployment
automation
technology_3
pattern_1
be
connector_2
the
way
developer
connector_data_3
their
component_5
with
this
our
intention
be
to
illustrate
that
pattern_1
be
a
valid
option
for
technology_1
jakarta
ee
developer
and
how
payara
micro
be
a
quality_attribute_4
component_2
to
reach
that
goal
advantage
of
pattern_1
the
purpose
of
a
pattern_2
architecture
be
to
break
down
an
component_5
into
small
standalone
component_6
that
be
easy
to
handle
quality_attribute_5
quality_attribute_1
and
maintain
in
the
long
term
sound
familiar
yes
this
be
something
that
many
developer
have
be
do
since
a
long
time
ago
pattern_3
pattern_4
and
a
quality_attribute_6
understand
of
pattern_5
architecture
have
help
them
apply
this
“divide
and
conquer”
strategy
to
architecture
for
many
year
and
will
do
so
in
the
future
a
well
so
what’s
the
advantage
of
a
pattern_2
architecture
then
pattern_1
be
quality_attribute_6
understand
when
compare
with
their
traditional
counterpart
monolithic
component_5
monolithic
component_5
or
monolith
be
usually
big
requirement_1
component_7
pattern_6
into
a
single
quality_attribute_7
package
if
you
want
to
introduce
a
component_8
or
update
an
exist
one
the
entire
monolith
must
be
update
at
once
this
be
the
way
requirement_1
component_7
be
usually
develop
focus
on
the
concept
of
tier
ui
technology_12
component_3
persistence
connector_data_1
and
the
segregation
of
concern
across
these
tier
so
while
a
monolith
be
a
normal
component_5
develop
with
traditional
mean
the
pattern_2
architecture
approach
would
be
to
break
down
such
an
component_5
into
it
separate
component_8
unit
or
component_3
so
that
each
unit
would
fulfill
the
follow
criterion
have
a
small
footprint
be
cohesive
e
g
focus
on
a
single
feature
or
requirement_5
requirement_4
connector_3
an
to
be
use
by
other
component_9
of
the
same
architecture
or
other
external
component_9
be
independently
manage
so
that
it
can
be
cod
test
and
quality_attribute_5
fast
be
responsible
for
handle
it
own
connector_data_1
be
isolate
from
other
component_3
so
no
direct
connector_4
be
need
monolith
vs
pattern_1
so
do
that
mean
that
pattern_1
should
be
use
instead
of
the
traditional
monolith
in
all
requirement_4
not
necessarily
pattern_1
not
only
define
a
architectural
style
but
also
require
that
development
team
build
component_7
in
a
different
manner
there
be
also
some
advantage
and
disadvantage
regard
when
to
use
a
monolith
and
when
to
use
pattern_1
consider
advantage
be
green
disadvantage
be
red
orange
be
for
variable
benefit
quality_attribute_8
on
the
requirement
or
the
organization’s
environment
monolith
pattern_1
cost
of
connector_5
across
all
tier
be
high
a
connector_2
of
a
single
feature
mean
a
redeployment
of
the
whole
unit
connector_5
be
easy
to
connector_6
and
not
costly
a
they
be
target
to
specific
component_9
only
all
component_6
belong
to
a
single
unit
there’s
no
connector_7
overhead
remote
connector_data_4
be
need
for
connector_7
between
component_3
so
this
overhead
factor
in
the
requirement_6
of
the
overall
component_5
the
entire
development
team
must
be
familiarize
with
the
design
and
composition
of
the
entire
component_5
each
component_3
can
be
handle
by
a
separate
team
so
this
favor
separation
of
concern
and
responsibility
develop
with
a
technological
technology_13
in
mind
use
one
or
two
technology_14
of
choice
a
technology_14
technology_15
be
chosen
to
govern
the
architecture
each
component_3
can
be
develop
use
a
different
technology_15
base
on
it
requirement
and
need
technology_16
be
discard
in
favor
of
improve
each
component_3
with
the
right
technology_3
easy
to
quality_attribute_5
the
complexity
of
deployment
increase
with
the
number
of
component_9
and
the
connector_7
connector_8
between
them
cluster
can
be
a
easy
or
difficult
quality_attribute_8
on
all
the
feature
connector_6
across
the
monolith
since
each
micro
component_3
be
small
cluster
be
generally
easy
with
quality_attribute_9
be
a
primary
drive
failure
of
a
component_8
can
cause
the
entire
component_5
to
fail
and
hinder
the
requirement_7
failure
of
a
component_3
will
only
bring
that
specific
component_3
down
leave
other
component_9
untouched
there’s
a
focus
on
tier
and
requirement_8
across
tier
there’s
a
focus
on
requirement_5
need
and
connector_7
concern
between
team
pattern_1
can
help
an
organization
develop
their
component_7
in
such
pattern_6
way
but
sometimes
when
component_7
be
not
critical
to
their
requirement_5
or
their
quality
attribute
requirement_6
quality_attribute_10
quality_attribute_9
quality_attribute_2
etc
be
not
specifically
demand
the
traditional
monolithic
approach
be
more
than
enough
pattern_1
and
technology_1
ee
the
technology_1
ee
set
of
specification
allow
the
creation
of
monolithic
component_7
with
ease
the
benefit
of
be
a
technology_1
ee
developer
be
that
you
don’t
have
to
worry
about
handle
technical
concern
requirement_9
handle
transaction
requirement_10
or
a
resource’s
lifecycle
when
the
specific
container
component_3
do
that
for
you
this
simplify
the
developer
work
allow
them
to
focus
on
requirement_5
concern
instead
in
the
requirement_4
of
technology_1
ee
a
monolithic
application’s
example
could
be
an
e
commerce
component_5
with
the
follow
characteristic
be
pattern_6
a
an
ear
with
multiple
connector_9
to
the
tier
of
the
monolith
an
technology_17
that
handle
requirement_8
aspect
technology_18
web
component_3
connector_data_5
handle
etc
another
technology_17
with
a
common
persistence
pattern_7
to
connector_10
connector_data_1
connector_11
with
traditional
mean
technology_19
technology_20
jca
etc
multiple
war
that
correspond
to
the
web
component_7
that
will
handle
the
component_10
let’s
say
this
component_5
have
war
one
for
an
administrative
another
to
be
use
by
technology_21
or
seller
and
another
for
the
use
of
buyer
since
the
application’s
build
with
technology_1
ee
most
of
the
be
connector_12
in
technology_1
for
the
war
the
component_10
would
be
probably
cod
use
technology_22
or
technology_23
in
conjunction
with
technology_24
this
would
ensure
consistency
since
the
entire
component_5
be
pattern_6
with
the
same
web
technology_11
sound
complex
yes
the
previous
scenario
be
a
common
occurrence
in
early
technology_1
ee
day
but
nowadays
with
technology_3
technology_25
or
technology_26
modularizing
technology_1
ee
component_5
have
simplify
the
development
of
monolith
on
technology_1
ee
mean
that
your
entire
component_5
can
be
quality_attribute_5
in
a
single
war
however
if
you
would
to
connector_6
this
e
commerce
component_5
a
a
set
of
pattern_1
a
quality_attribute_3
war
will
not
be
enough
there
be
no
technology_11
restriction
that
prevent
you
to
create
pattern_1
use
the
technology_1
ee
component_11
via
an
component_5
component_1
technology_6
and
payara
component_1
by
extension
however
there
be
some
consideration
to
have
in
mind
since
each
pattern_2
must
be
a
complete
standalone
quality_attribute_7
unit
this
mean
that
each
component_3
should
be
compose
of
an
component_5
quality_attribute_5
within
it
own
technology_1
ee
component_1
so
if
for
example
an
component_5
be
compose
of
micro
component_3
then
you
would
need
separate
installation
of
an
component_5
component_1
to
component_12
each
component_3
most
component_5
component_13
aren’t
exactly
lightweight
consider
their
complexity
and
the
feature
they
offer
e
g
payara
server’s
full
profile
currently
weight
around
140mb
although
most
component_5
component_13
have
greatly
reduce
their
startup
time
there’s
some
overhead
since
the
component_5
component_1
need
to
prepare
and
handle
many
component_6
that
won’t
be
need
for
a
specific
component_3
for
example
when
boot
a
technology_6
domain
the
component_1
need
to
initialize
it
pattern_8
subsystem
and
this
be
something
most
component_9
won’t
need
unless
it’s
strictly
necessary
payara
micro
to
the
rescue
payara
micro
be
create
with
these
concern
in
mind
it’s
relatively
small
in
size
packaged
a
a
jar
and
allow
developer
to
easily
run
a
pattern_2
with
a
quality_attribute_3
command
technology_1
jar
payara
jar
quality_attribute_5
component_10
component_3
war
contextroot
run
this
command
for
each
component_3
and
you
don’t
have
to
worry
about
a
long
startup
time
for
your
component_3
or
have
to
repeat
the
installation
of
a
component_1
multiple
time
since
payara
micro
be
base
on
the
technology_1
ee
web
profile
this
mean
that
complex
or
component_14
component_11
won’t
be
quality_attribute_11
technology_27
jca
jax
w
technology_28
remote
etc
one
of
the
advantage
of
use
payara
micro
to
provision
a
pattern_1
architecture
be
it
ability
to
automatically
form
a
cluster
with
other
payara
micro
instance
that
be
live
in
the
same
requirement_9
here’s
a
the
most
basic
sample
of
launch
a
cluster
of

once

join
the

every

will
report

the
conceptual
equivalent
of
a

which
be
an

connector_data_1

solution
for

that
power

mechanism
by

with

use
the
pattern_9

in

where

be
not
support

or
certain
requirement_2
technology_21
technology_31
other
requirement_9
connector_7

be

at

requirement_11
support
for

requirement_2
technology_21
so
keep
and
eye
on
what’s
to
come
jakarta
ee
–
bring
technology_1
ee
to
the
future
at
technology_1
one
technology_32
make
the
huge
announcement
to
open_source
the
technology_1
ee
technology_11
in
it
entirety
surprise
the
technology_1
the
home
of
the
technology_1
ee
technology_11
would
be
the
eclipse
foundation
under
the
name
jakarta
ee
chosen
in
a
democratic
vote
by
the
after
the
technology_33
foundation
kindly
“donated”
the
name
a
of
the
component_16
of
transfer
the
entire
set
of
specification
reference
implementation
and
tcks
to
the
eclipse
foundation
be
still
underway
but
a
major
milestone
be
reach
at
the
end
of
eclipse
technology_6
be
release
to
the
this
version
of
technology_6
be
technically
quality_attribute_13
with
technology_1
ee
and
will
pave
the
way
for
the
first
release
of
the
jakarta
ee
specification
jakarta
ee
late
in
the
year
once
that
milestone
be
reach
the
will
move
connector_15
to
a
version
of
the
specification
which
will
include
a
lot
of
improvement
the
exist
apis
this
from
arjan
timms
introduce
the
most
interest
idea
that
at
the
moment
be
be
connector_6
in
the
exist
project
that
have
be
transfer
to
the
eclipse
foundation
have
say
all
of
this
what
be
the
advantage
of
jakarta
ee
over
technology_1
ee
for
pattern_2
architecture
then
well
the
answer
be
quality_attribute_3
none
since
even
after
jakarta
ee
be
release
it
won’t
be
any
different
in
the
scope
of
it
feature
from
technology_1
ee
however
now
that
the
technology_11
have
be
open
component_15
and
will
be
move
connector_15
by
the
concert
effort
of
the
the
exist
component_11
can
be
quality_attribute_14
with
pattern_1
pattern_10
in
mind
which
will
lead
to
a
great
simplification
of
the
development
and
deployment
need
for
these
architecture
even
quality_attribute_6
component_11
can
be
connector_6
in
order
to
bridge
the
gap
in
the
current
set
of
feature
an
component_17
to
modularize
deployment
or
a
technology_16
component_17
to
pattern_11
deployment
unit
in
a
quality_attribute_12
arrangement
there
be
high
expectation
on
the
future
of
the
component_2
now
that
technology_32
be
no
long
connector_16
the
shoot
with
a
renew
focus
on
modernize
the
technology_11
eclipse
microprofile
although
jakarta
ee
be
look
up
quality_attribute_6
for
provide
a
complete
technology_11
for
pattern_1
base
on
requirement_1
technology_1
it
be
not
the
only
technology_11
that
quality_attribute_13
technology_1
ee
component_13
can
use
the
eclipse
microprofile
component_17
be
a
set
of
standardize
component_11
align
with
the
technology_1
ee
specification
that
vendor
can
connector_6
in
order
to
develop
pattern_1
the
goal
of
microprofile
be
to
provide
component_6
that
build
upon
the
core
feature
of
technology_1
ee
allow
a
more
intuitive
development
experience
when
connector_14
pattern_1
grant
more
quality_attribute_15
option
and
reduce
risk
or
over
design
and
re
invent
the
same
pattern_10
the
current
version
of
eclipse

and
it
be

the
follow
set
of
apis
technology_34
use
a
the
“glue”

both

micro
be
quality_attribute_13
and
certify
implementation
of
eclipse
microprofile
version
be
quality_attribute_13
up
to
microprofile
v2
however
this
mean
that
you
can
use
all
microprofile’s
component_11
in
conjunction
with
other
technology_1
ee
apis
and
this
be
not
limit
for
the
development
of
pattern_1
only
if
you
want
to
develop
a
traditional
monolith
while
benefit
of
the
feature
and
facility
introduce
by
microprofile
then
you
can
do
that
quality_attribute_19
be
a
key
concern
of
the
payara
component_2
quality_attribute_6
practice
and
recommendation
you
still
need
to
go
the
extra
mile
and
guarantee
that
your
component_9
fulfill
the
criterion
describe
previously
to
develop
requirement_1
ready
pattern_1
since
the
technology_16
practice
for
develop
technology_1
ee
component_7
will
not
be
enough
the
follow
be
a
connector_data_9
of
my
personal
quality_attribute_6
practice
and
recommendation
that
you
should
follow
when
build
micro
component_9
with
technology_1
ee
and
eclipse
microprofile
packaging
package
your
component_7
a
war
project
there’s
no
need
to
use
the
ear
packaging
since
that
would
imply
a
composition
of
and
a
pattern_2
should
be
pattern_6
use
the
minimum
unit
of
deployment
payara
micro
allow
the
creation
of
uber
jar
you
can
use
it
to
create
an
auto
launchable
fat
jar
that
contain
all
it
necessary
connector_4
this
can
be
useful
on
requirement_2
requirement_11
or
containerize
environment
especially
when
set
a
continuous
deployment
pipeline
use
devops
technology_3
use
technology_41
for
example
component_3
connector_7
define
all
the
boundary
of
your
component_9
use
technology_38
and
pattern_13
whenever
possible
this
will
guarantee
that
you
will
be
able
to
connector_21
with
other
component_9
that
compose
your
component_5
even
if
they’re
not
develop
use
technology_1
technology_1
ee
or
microprofile
each
pattern_2
should
have
pattern_13
define
with
jax
r
use
the
eclipse
microprofile
rest
component_18
component_17
to
connector_data_7
other
component_9
so
that
you
can
remove
a
lot
of
the
boilerplate
that
be
use
to
setup
each
technology_38
connector_data_10
include
other
component_9
that
be
part
of
your
architecture
even
quality_attribute_6
you
can
define
the
for
both
technology_35
component_9
and
it
component_22
in
one
place
and
re
use
them
accordingly
document
all
pattern_13
thoroughly
so
that
the
connector_7
rule
be
clear
from
the
start
use
the
eclipse
microprofile
openapi
which
will
allow
you
to
annotate
your
technology_35
component_3
definition
in
order
to
generate
an
openapi
document
automatically
be
possible
to
use
the
technology_34
bus
provide
by
payara
micro
to
propagate
remote
from
one
component_3
to
another
pattern_18
connector_7
this
which
follow
a
reactive
component_23
improve
the
decouple
of
your
component_9
from
each
other
however
keep
in
mind
that
this
feature
be
proprietary
only
to
payara
component_1
and
micro
so
only
micro
component_9
quality_attribute_5
on
them
can
use
it
consider
use
this
feature
only
for
establish
connector_7
between
component_9
that
belong
to
the
same
component_5
since
all
of
them
connector_22
the
same
technology_11
technology_13
if
you
need
to
connector_21
with
external
component_3
rely
on
the
usual
technology_38
connector_7
instead
component_6
use
technology_34
component_24
to
define
your
component_7
component_8
since
technology_34
be
both
the
cornerstone
component_8
component_17
for
both
technology_1
ee
and
eclipse
microprofile
you’ll
benefit
from
the
requirement_8
that
be
quality_attribute_11
for
both
use
requirement_1
javabeans
technology_17
only
when
a
specific
feature
you
need
to
use
be
not
quality_attribute_11
on
the
technology_34
component_17
timer
for
example
the
eclipse
microprofile
configuration
component_17
allow
a
way
to
define
a
unify
mechanism
to
load
configuration
requirement_12
from
multiple
component_15
the
default
component_25
support
by
the
component_17
be
the
meta
inf
microprofile
config
property
locate
in
the
deployment
unit
component_26
property
environment
variable
in
most
requirement_4
these
component_25
be
more
than
enough
for
production
need
environment
variable
be
fairly
use
in
conjunction
with
container
but
the
component_17
allow
for
quality_attribute_17
configuration
component_25
a
well
connector_23
from
a
component_27
or
a
configuration
component_1
too
quality_attribute_8
on
stateless
component_6
all
time
stateful
component_6
be
not
only
more
complex
to
quality_attribute_1
but
they
will
also
make
it
hard
to
transfer
component_10
connector_data_1
between
a
set
of
micro
component_3
when
use
technology_34
component_28
use
only
the
@requestscoped
and
@applicationscoped
scope
if
use
ejbs
quality_attribute_8
on
@stateless
and
@singleton
component_29
component_24
only
don’t
component_30
connector_data_1
in
technology_38
component_29
connector_data_11
by
default
the
technology_38
component_29
connector_data_11
be
manage
by
a
web
component_5
so
define
short
live
component_31
around
minute
even
if
you
don’t
use
it
at
all
consider
use
technology_42
powered
component_10
for
your
web
component_5
technology_15
technology_43
and
technology_44
be
quality_attribute_6
technology_3
to
build
rich
web
nowadays
if
you
be
consider
use
technology_22
component_32
for
the
component_10
consider
use
stateless
pattern_19
f
pattern_19
transient=”true”
both
payara
component_1
and
payara
micro
support
the
jcache
technology_45
which
allow
component_5
to
pattern_20
requirement_12
in
memory
pattern_20
connector_data_1
in
this
manner
can
greatly
improve
the
requirement_6
of
any
pattern_2
when
use
correctly
the
jcache
api’s
implementation
in
the
payara
component_2
be
provide
by
hazelcast
which
allow
for
quality_attribute_12
pattern_20
in
any
cluster
arrangement
which
can
greatly
simplify
failover
mechanism
a
well
quality_attribute_2
and
connector_data_1
requirement_10
for
component_9
that
need
connector_data_1
component_30
consider
use
small
size
relational
component_27
technology_46
or
technology_47
so
you
can
leverage
technology_19
with
it
connector_data_11
relational
capability
technology_19
be
part
of
technology_1
ee
but
not
part
of
eclipse
microprofile
so
keep
this
in
mind
both
payara
component_1
and
payara
micro
already
include
technology_46
a
their
default
relational
component_27
for
internal
use
so
you
can
benefit
from
this
inclusion
a
well
if
you’re
in
need
of
a
fast
or
easy
to
quality_attribute_1
component_27
switch
to
a
technology_48
solution
that
suit
your
need
technology_49
or
technology_50
don’t
worry
about
requirement_11
requirement_8
with
technology_1
ee
or
eclipse
microprofile
since
most
technology_48
component_27
already
provide
easy
to
use
technology_1
and
plenty
of
documentation
about
production
usage
in
order
to
quality_attribute_20
each
micro
component_3
implementation
rely
on
technology_37
web
connector_data_8
jwt
since
jwt
be
a
widely
requirement_13
connector_24
technology_16
you
can
expect
that
your
component_9
will
be
quality_attribute_13
with
most
component_18
component_22
out
there
and
the
specification
be
pretty
quality_attribute_4
a
well
you
can
use
the
eclipse
microprofile
jwt
pattern_15
component_17
to
allow
your
micro
component_3
to
be
automatically
quality_attribute_20
use
a
jwt
technology_21
auth0
for
example
role
base
pattern_21
use
jaas
annotation
@rolesallowed
@permitall
and
@denyall
infrastructure
always
make
use
of
payara
micro’s
auto
cluster
capability
which
will
allow
you
to
connector_6
elastic
deployment
in
your
infrastructure
technology_4
container
be
a
must
configure
your
application’s
deployment
with
a
technology_4
image
that
can
help
you
automate
the
deployment
component_16
of
your
pattern_1
quality_attribute_6
yet
use
the
official
payara
micro
image
to
create
your
own
lastly
consider
use
pattern_22
technology_3
to
organize
cluster
of
your
micro
component_9
technology_33
mesos
consul
technology_5
or
technology_4
swarm
both
payara
component_1
and
payara
micro
support
requirement_11
technology_5
cluster
even
so
if
you
use
it
for
pattern_11
a
quality_attribute_12
infrastructure
you
can
quickly
configure
how
each
technology_51
instance
join
the
cluster
use
the
technology_5
discovery
mode
provide
by
the
domain
connector_data_1
grid
payara
micro
be
the
ideal
place
to
start
on
your
pattern_1
journey
pattern_1
be
here
to
stay
so
any
requirement_1
organization
should
consider
connector_14
a
pattern_2
architecture
when
there
be
enough
benefit
to
reap
for
this
reason
alone
technology_1
ee
cannot
be
leave
behind
and
must
move
on
in
order
to
help
developer
transition
to
this
style
which
be
goal
that
be
no
long
a
dream
thanks
to
both
jakarta
ee
and
microprofile
payara
micro
be
the
ideal
place
to
start
especially
if
you’re
already
familiar
with
the
development
of
technology_1
ee
component_5
keep
in
mind
that
pattern_1
be
not
a
silver
bullet
and
this
should
be
common
knowledge
use
the
traditional
monolithic
approach
whenever
possible
and
switch
to
pattern_1
when
you
think
that
their
benefit
suit
your
need
and
justify
their
use
this
transition
not
only
mean
have
a
quality_attribute_6
grasp
of
the
technical
challenge
you
will
be
face
but
also
understand
that
there
can
be
organizational
