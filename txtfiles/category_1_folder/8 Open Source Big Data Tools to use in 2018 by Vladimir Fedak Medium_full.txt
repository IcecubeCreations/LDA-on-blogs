open_source
requirement_1
technology_1
to
use
in
2018big
connector_data_1
requirement_2
be
an
essential
part
of
any
requirement_3
workflow
nowadays
to
make
the
most
of
it
we
recommend
use
these
popular
open_source
requirement_1
solution
for
each
stage
of
connector_data_1
component_1
why
opt
for
open_source
requirement_1
technology_1
and
not
for
proprietary
solution
you
might
ask
the
reason
become
obvious
over
the
last
decade
—
open
component_2
the
be
the
way
to
make
it
popular
developer
prefer
to
avoid
vendor
lock
in
and
tend
to
use
free
technology_1
for
the
sake
of
versatility
a
well
a
due
to
the
possibility
to
contribute
to
the
evolvement
of
their
beloved
component_3
open_source
technology_2
boast
the
same
if
not
quality_attribute_1
level
of
documentation
depth
along
with
a
much
more
dedicate
support
from
the
who
be
also
the
technology_2
developer
and
requirement_1
practitioner
who
what
they
need
from
a
technology_2
thus
say
this
be
the
connector_data_2
of
pattern_1
requirement_1
technology_1
to
use
in
base
on
popularity

richness
and
usefulness
