the
hyper
dynamic
approach
to
requirement_1
have
lead
to
the
development
of
requirement_5
computing
in
the
form
of
iaa
paas
and
saas
with
our
current
buzzword
pattern_1
be
aggressively
seek
for
implementation
notably
tech
giant
walmart
and
use
it
have
connector_5
the
attention
of
the
mass
who
look
connector_6
to
revolutionize
their
requirement_1
component_2
with
a
modular
approach
you
also
quality_attribute_2
your
pattern_1
monolithic
architecture
to
understand
the
reason
behind
the
dawn
of
pattern_1
architecture
a
monolithic
have
a
singular
approach
to
the
entire
architecture
and
the
addition
of
pattern_3
separate
one
component_3
from
others
they
be
quality_attribute_3
to
understand
conceptually
and
development
cycle
tend
to
be
widely
recognize
by
the
tech
across
the
globe
but
they
exhibit
meager
quality_attribute_4
they
have
multiple
constraint
such
a
resource
quality_attribute_5
long
deployment
cycle
non
confirmation
to
continuous
delivery
use
single
cod
technology_2
for
all
component_3
and
malfunctioning
of
a
single
component_3
be
reflect
on
the
entire
hence
requirement_1
be
look
connector_6
to
a
modular
and
dynamic
approach
to
connector_7
these
concern
since
they
affect
requirement_1
component_2
tremendously
u
start
with
the
basic
a
per
adrian
cockcroft
battery
venture
“microservices
be
loosely
couple
pattern_4
architecture
with
bind
component_4
”
the
quality_attribute_6
of
these
loosely
couple
component_5
be
base
on
component_3
drive
need
the
component_6
cod
for
all
the
component_5
be
different
and
they
can
be
quality_attribute_7
and
apply
to
connector_8
independently
it
u
component_7
to
connector_9
the
connector_data_1
and
requirement_8
of
one
component_8
with
another
a
the
output
of
one
component_3
become
the
input
for
the
other
it
also
help
in
the
simplification
of
quality_attribute_1
pattern_5
since
each
part
be
isolate
from
the
others
if
one
of
the
need
of
the
component_8
requirement_3
it
be
develop
in
technology_3
but
it
doesn’t
require
entire
to
use
the
same
technology_2
insight
representational
state
transfer
rest
component_7
be
integral
to
pattern_1
a
they
use
technology_4
verb
manage
semantics
and
uniform
resource
identifier
uri
for
technology_5
io
environment
while
technology_6
technology_7
base
component_7
be
use
for
browser
use
in
personal
component_9
and
requirement_9
phone
we
can
understand
the
difference
between
the
two
with
the
follow
example
of
statute
the
monolithic
architecture
resemble
statue
build
by
carving
stone
the
one
in
greek
sculpture
while
with
pattern_1
approach
be
similar
to
use
lego
block
to
do
the
same
if
your
stone
sculpture
be
damage
partially
you
have
to
scrap
the
whole
statue
while
you
can
always
replace
the
lego
block
and
tweak
your
artifact
on
will
the
critical
factor
to
be
keep
in
mind
for
connector_2
it
be
to
balance
quality_attribute_8
and
quality_attribute_9
much
the
term
risk
adjust
rar
use
in
financial
instrument
high
quality_attribute_4
and
modular
approach
when
club
with
deployment
redeployment
cycle
create
a
high
amount
of
complication
the
implementation
phase
quality_attribute_10
much
on
how
the
pattern_1
architecture
be
design
and
the
of
implementation
this
can
be
quickly
do
by
create
a
‘central
key
deliverable’
around
which
all
component_5
be
design
insight
a
per
the
top
four
challenge
face
by
organization
while
connector_2
pattern_1
be
corporate
culture
pattern_1
requirement_10
diagnostics
and
pattern_6
along
with
time
and
resource
u
have
a
look
at
the
step
by
step
implementation
component_10
stage
focus
on
agility
and
quality_attribute_11
a
in
the
requirement_11
of
the
online
connector_10
component_8
netflix
the
need
to
provide
on
demand
component_8
be
extremely
important
a
it
be
the
usp
for
the
premium
experience
it
promise
the
delivery
cycle
need
to
be
drastically
short
with
a
high
frequency
to
provide
continuous
delivery
of
component_8
however
the
emphasis
shall
be
lay
on
the
quality_attribute_12
nature
of
resources’
requirement
a
one
component_3
need
resource
more
frequently
than
the
rest
therefore
the
core
requirement_1
competency
be
instrumental
drive
factor
to
design
the
core
development
philosophy
with
which
each
individual
component_3
should
resonate
to
understand
quality_attribute_13
it
consider
that
your
requirement_12
need
to
work
in
an
environment
with
fluctuate
demand
of
resource
so
it
will
be
a
quality_attribute_13
idea
to
develop
a
resource
utilization
similar
to
step
stone
where
the
resource
such
a
component_11
be
generate
in
small
step
a
per
demand
the
component_12
capacity
can
be
quality_attribute_12
in
small
compartment
of
five
component_13
and
the
addition
of
the
sixth
component_13
will
create
the
resource
for
the
next
five
component_13
similarly
the
reduction
in
utilization
will
also
be
reflect
in
the
reduce
use
of
resource
which
help
in
rapid
quality_attribute_4
stage
manage
quality_attribute_1
and
individual
component_6
maturity
the
replaceability
of
individual
component_14
and
independent
quality_attribute_14
be
the
two
most
substantial
requirement
for
a
requirement_1
will
to
use
a
pattern_1
architecture
still
they
shall
not
overcompensate
the
quality_attribute_1
of
the
requirement_1
component_15
for
instance
a
bfsi
sector
requirement_12
can
afford
a
bit
slow
component_15
for
monetary
transaction
still
it
cannot
overlook
any
quality_attribute_1
risk
since
the
quality_attribute_15
of
the
component_16
be
at
the
center
of
the
sr
and
conops
document
this
be
because
the
risk
in
the
requirement_11
of
component_17
in
the
form
of
requirement_1
component_18
be
very
high
such
a
small
mistake
in
requirement_6
with
web
base
payroll
for
disbursement
can
cost
way
more
than
erroneous
transaction
of
retail
component_19
you
shall
devise
component_5
base
on
the
nature
of
your
requirement_1
specifically
for
successful
implementation
the
iterative
nature
of
this
architecture
will
profess
the
need
for
standardize
the
maturity
level
of
individual
component_6
cod
for
each
component_8
to
serve
the
phase
specific
goal
and
solution
provide
by
the
component_8
fail
to
do
so
connector_data_2
in
complicate
the
prospectus
of
future
component_3
of
component_5
since
the
goal
of
architecture
quality_attribute_8
quality_attribute_9
be
relative
to
both
the
quality_attribute_16
holistic
collective
output
of
the
component_16
and
the
implementation
phase
hence
the
connector_8
in
the
component_6
of
one
component_8
need
to
be
in
line
with
the
overall
maturity
of
the
component_6
cod
of
the
component_16
a
a

both

the
cost
of

therefore
the

the
