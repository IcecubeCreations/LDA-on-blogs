hi
i
m
valerio
engineer
cto
&
founder
at
inspector
the
time
many
developer
discover
the
need
to
pattern_2
their
component_1
often
coincide
with
when
they
first
start
work
on
a
large
project
the
reason
be
quality_attribute_1
when
your
become
complex
or
be
use
by
highly
valuable
requirement_4
bug
become
expensive
doubly
so
when
your
requirement_4
find
them
requirement_4
rate
you
a
unreliable
and
search
for
alternative
solve
requirement_4
critical
problem
can
certainly
generate
great
requirement_5
opportunity
but
the
more
critical
the
problem
be
the
more
you
need
to
be
ready
for
really
high
requirement_4
expectation
pattern_1
be
the
way
for
developer
to
avoid
unexpected
incident
and
retain
requirement_4
or
contract
a
long
a
possible
which
mean
quality_attribute_2
income
for
your
requirement_5
over
time
the
idea
behind
inspector
be
to
create
a
pattern_1
environment
specifically
design
for
developer
avoid
any
component_2
or
infrastructure
configuration
that
many
developer
hate
to
deal
with
it
work
with
a
lightweight
technology_4
that
you
can
install
in
your
component_3
any
other
connector_3
coding_keyword_3
me
show
you
how
it
work
install
the
technology_1
package
run
the
composer
command
in
your
terminal
composer
require

enter
fullscreen

exit

configure
the
ingestion
key
connector_4
a
fresh
component_4
key
by
sign
up
for
inspector
and
create
a
project
it
take

second
you
ll
see
installation
instruction
directly
in
the

screen
the

in

go

connector_data_3
unhandled
exception
we
turn
on
the
light
in
the
50%
of
our
component_5
connector_5
in
background
the
next
step
be
to
pattern_2
all
transaction
generate
by
component_8
connector_8
incoming
web
connector_data_4
pattern_1
to
activate
pattern_1
also
when
your
component_5
be
connector_5
due
to
an
incoming
technology_6
connector_data_5
you
can
use
the
webrequestmonitoring
technology_7
it
work
any
other
technology_1
technology_7
you
be
familiar
to
so
you
be
free
to
decide
which
connector_11
need
to
be
pattern_2
base
on
your
connector_11
configuration
or
on
your
personal
pattern_1
preference
the
most
easy
way
to
cover
all
your
component_3
connector_11
be
attach
the
technology_7
in
the
app\http\kernel

**
*
the
component_3

connector_12
technology_7

enter

exit

instantly
you
will
see
transaction
connector_13
in
your
project’s
requirement_6
and
for
each

you
can

enrich

could
be
many
critical
statement
in
your
that
need

in

of

and
error
technology_6

thanks
to
our

you
can
custom

to
those
detected
by

to
measure
the
impact
that
an
hide

have
on
a

coding_keyword_3
me
show
you
a
real
life
example
suppose
you
have
a
component_7
that
connector_14
some
component_6
connector_15
and
an
technology_6
connector_data_5
to
an
external
component_10
and
connector_16
be
measure
automatically
but
it
could
be
interest
to
pattern_2
and
measure
the
connector_9
of
the
technology_6
connector_data_5
and
activate
alerting
if
somethings
go
wrong
simply
use
the
inspector
helper

}
enter

you
will
see
the
impact
of

in
your

timeline
in
real
time
error
&
exception
alerting
by
default
every
exception
fire
in
your
technology_1
component_5
will
be
report
automatically
to
be
sure
you’re
alert
for
unpredictable
error
in
real
time
i
wish
that
every
connector_17
i
make
to
my
could
be
perfect
but
the
reality
be
this
be
not
always
the
requirement_8
some
error
appear
immediately
after
an
update
while
others
pop
up
unpredictably
it’s
an
unfortunate
fact
of
life
for
developer
which
often
also
quality_attribute_3
on
problem
cause
by
the
connector_18
between
our
component_3
and
other
component_10
however
inspector
make
my
easy
it
automate
the
detection
of
unknown
issue
so
i
no
long
need
to
manually
connector_6
the
status
of
my
component_11
continuously
or
wait
report
directly
from
component_8
if
something
go
wrong
i’ll
connector_19
a
connector_data_3
in
real
time
and
after
each
release
i
can
stay
inform
about
the
impact
of
the
late
refactor
if
your
fire
an
exception
but
you
don’t
want
to
block
the
connector_9
you
can
report
the
error
to
inspector
manually
for
private
pattern_1
about
quality_attribute_4
of
the
external
component_12
try
{
your
dangerous
here
}
catch

}
enter

exit

furthermore
if
the
technology_6
connector_data_5
fail
you
will
be
alert
in
real
time
in
your
inbox
to
take
a
look
at
the
error
a
it
appear
you
even
connector_4
connector_20
to
detail
connector_data_7
gather
by
inspector
in
real
time
conclusion
when
a
requirement_4
report
to
you
that
something
isn’t
work
it
force
you
to
drop
whatever
you
be
do
and
start
try
to
reproduce
the
scenario
then
recapture
and
reanalyze
the
requirement_2
in
your
own
toolset
connector_21
a
true
picture
of
what’s
happen
can
require
hour
or
base
on
my
experience
even
day
inspector
can
make
a
huge
difference
in
term
of
quality_attribute_5
productivity
and
requirement_4
happiness
to
inspector
be
you
look
for
a

drive
pattern_1
technology_9
instead
of
have
to
install
thing
at
the
component_2
level
connector_4
a
pattern_1
environment
specifically
design
for
developer
avoid
any
component_2
or
infrastructure
configuration
thanks
to
inspector
you
will
never
have
the
need
to
install
thing
at
the
component_2
level
or
make
complex
configuration
in
your
requirement_9
infrastructure
to
pattern_2
your
component_3
in
real
time
inspector
work
with
a
lightweight
technology_4
that
you
can
install
in
your
component_3
any
other
connector_3
in
requirement_8
of
technology_1
you
can
install
our
official
technology_1
package
developer
be
not
always
comfortable
instal
and
configure
at
the
component_2
level
because
these
installation
be
often
manage
by

they
be
