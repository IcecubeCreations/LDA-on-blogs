start

define

hold

type
connector_data_3
etc
that
you
want
to
have
on

then
you
create
a

to
listen
to
connector_data_1
within

your
separate
connector_data_1
space
which
again
hold
datareaders
and
or
datawriters
to
connector_13
or
connector_14
that
topic
example
i
want
to
connector_5
and
have
someone
connector_15
the
requirement_12
of
my
delicious
homemade
strawberry
ice
cream
a
«double»
can
hold
the
requirement_12
such
an
item
but
it
would
make
no
sense
if
i
connector_16
that
double
on
the
wire
without
any
contextual
connector_data_2
so
a
topic
be
create
i
connector_data_8
it
«icecreamprice»
use
«double»
a
the
connector_data_1
type
and
thus
enabling
me
to
connector_5
and
someone
to
connector_15
this
requirement_12
then
i
create
connector_data_1
writer
and
reader
with
some
qos
set
to
connector_5
and
connector_15
that
topic
a
quality_attribute_18

we
then
start
use

open

dd
the
first

for

5th
we
purchase
rti

my

then
work
with
rti
connext
dd
to
connector_18
the
connector_3
between
gui

early
we
use

in

start
in

they
also
start
develop

requirement_6
a

a
possible
with

we
have
develop

this
enable
the
