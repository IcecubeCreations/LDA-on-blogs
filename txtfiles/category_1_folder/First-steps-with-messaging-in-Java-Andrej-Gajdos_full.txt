first
step

in

2015june
by

gajdos
in
this
i
will
introduce
some
pattern_1
concept
and
try
to
emphasize
some
insight
which
be
important
for
beginner
at
the
end
of
this
i
will
show
a
short
example
with
technology_2
type
of
pattern_1
connector_1
among
component_1
can
be
pattern_2
or
pattern_3
and
persistent
or
transient
if
we
want
to
build
a
complex
quality_attribute_1
component_2
we
have
to
use
various
combination
of
connector_1
the
rest
of
this
be
focus
on
technology_3
which
be
an
of
connector_data_1
orient
technology_4
and
can
be
typically
use
for
pattern_3
persistent
connector_1
in
this
short
you
can
see
basic
connector_data_2
about
mom
and
difference
among
other
type
of
connector_1
typically
a
sender
component_3
component_4
create
a
connector_data_1
and
connector_2
it
to
a
component_5
and
a
receiver
component_6
component_4
connector_3
the
connector_data_1
from
the
component_5
and
component_1
it
component_3
and
component_6
don’t
about
their
existence
connector_data_1
component_7
be
typically
provide
by
connector_data_1
pattern_4
a
connector_data_1
pattern_4
be
a
standalone
component_8
component_9
that
other
component_10
connector_4
to
and
connector_5
connector_6
connector_data_1
a
connector_data_1
pattern_4
be
responsible
for
connector_7
connector_data_3
until
a
receiver
connector_8
them
a
connector_data_1
pattern_4
can
connector_9
connector_data_3
across
component_11
to
connector_10
a
connector_data_1
to
the
destination
component_8
and
can
try
connector_11
the
connector_data_1
until
the
receiver
correctly
handle
it
connector_data_1
pattern_4
a
a
connector_data_1
transfer
agent
be
an
extra
component_12
in
the
architecture
and
be
the
primary
disadvantage
of
many
connector_data_1
orient
technology_4
component_13
technology_2
hornetq
technology_5
technology_6
or
blablamq
we
need
to
build
pattern_3
connector_1
between
two
component_4
which
technology_7
and
implementation
of
connector_data_1
pattern_4
should
we
use
do
we
really
need
a
connector_data_1
pattern_4
or
technology_8
compliant
solution
technology_2
hornetq
and
technology_5
be
connector_data_1
pattern_4
and
offer
support
for
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_5
basically
all
pattern_4
be
highly
quality_attribute_2
quality_attribute_3
and
quality_attribute_4
with
some
limitation
technology_9
be
a
technology_7
to
create
quality_attribute_1
and
concurrent
component_8
the
technology_6
component_14
be
similar
to
the
low
level
connector_data_4
component_14
for
connector_1
over
requirement_3
and
also
suitable
for
in
component_15
pattern_3
programming
over
the
internet
you
can
find
some
deal
with
comparison
of
connector_data_1
pattern_4
this
or
kuntal
ganguly’s
comparison
i
the
most
thomas
bayer’s
comparison
where
everything
important
be
highlight
before
you
choose
your
…mq
solution
i
recommend
to
you
connector_12
this
point
to
point
vs
pattern_6
component_16
when
we
choose
our
pattern_1
technology_7
and
connector_data_1
pattern_4
we
should
decide
what
kind
of
technology_8
destination
be
suitable
technology_8
destination
be
an
connector_data_5
that
represent
the
target
of
connector_data_3
that
the
component_17
produce
and
the
component_18
of
connector_data_3
that
the
component_17
connector_13
component_5
represent
a
point
to
point
component_16
where
a
single
connector_data_1
be
connector_14
by
exactly
one
component_6
and
connector_data_3
have
to
be
connector_10
in
the
order
connector_5
topic
represent
a
publish
and
subscribe
component_16
where
zero
to
multiple
component_19
can
subscribe
to
the
connector_data_1
and
there
be
no
guarantee
for
the
order
of
delivery
from
the
connector_data_3
connector_5
pattern_1
anti
pattern_5
we
choose
a
technology_7
connector_data_1
pattern_4
destination
and
now
we
can
build
a
connector_data_1
component_2
right
no
we
can’t
if
we
don’t
have
any
experience
with
connector_data_1
we
should
about
common
pattern_1
anti
pattern_5
we
don’t
find
them
in
documentation
and
should
keep
them
in
mind
dejan
bosanac
connector_15
great
about
pattern_1
anti
pattern_5
i
think
the
first
be
the
most
important
where
you
can
find
out
how
you
shouldn’t
use
destination
the
second
part
be
about
manage
connector_16
and
the
third
about
connector_data_1
type
