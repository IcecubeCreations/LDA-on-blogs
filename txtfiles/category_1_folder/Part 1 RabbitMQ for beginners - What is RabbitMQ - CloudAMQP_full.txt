example
a
connector_data_1
pattern_1
act
a
a
middleman
for
various
component_9
e
g
a
web
component_5
a
in
this
example
they
can
be
use
to
reduce
load
and
delivery
time
of
web
component_5
component_10
by
delegate
connector_data_5
that
would
normally
take
up
a
lot
of
time
or
resource
to
a
third
party
that
have
no
other

in
this
guide
we
follow
a
scenario
where
a
web
component_5
allow
component_11
to
connector_10
connector_data_3
to
a

the
will
handle
this
connector_data_3
generate
a
pdf
and
it
back
to
the
component_12
handle
the
connector_data_3
generate
the
pdf
and
connector_11
the
will
in
this
example
requirement_3
take
several
second
that
be
one
of
the
reason
why
a
connector_data_1
component_1
will
be
use
to
perform
the
connector_data_4
when
the
component_12
have
enter
component_12
connector_data_3
into
the
web

the
web
component_5
will
create
a
pdf
component_4
connector_data_1
that
include
all
of
the
important
connector_data_3
the
component_12
need
into
a
connector_data_1
and
place
it
onto
a
component_1
define
in
technology_1
the
basic
architecture
of
a
connector_data_1
component_1
be
quality_attribute_1
there
be
component_13
component_3
connector_12
component_14
that
create
connector_data_2
and
connector_13
them
to
the
pattern_1
the
connector_data_1
component_1
other
component_5
connector_12
component_15
connector_4
to
the
component_1
and
subscribe
to
the
connector_data_2
to
be
component_4
act
a
a
component_16
or
component_15
or
both
a
component_15
and
a
component_16
of
connector_data_1
connector_data_2
place
onto
the
component_1
be
component_17
until
the
component_15
connector_14
them
when
and
why
should
you
use
technology_1
connector_data_1
component_1
allow
web
component_10
to
respond
to
connector_data_6
quickly
instead
of
be
force
to
perform
resource
heavy
on
the
spot
that
delay
response_time
connector_data_1
component_1
be
also
quality_attribute_2
when
you
want
to
quality_attribute_3
a
connector_data_1
to
multiple
component_18
or
to
balance
load
between
component_19
the
component_15
take
a
connector_data_1
off
the
component_1
and
start
component_4
the
pdf
at
the
same
time
the
component_16
be
component_1
up
connector_data_1
the
component_15
can
be
on
a
totally
different
component_6
than
the
component_16
or
they
can
be
locate
on
the
same
component_6
the
connector_data_7
can
be
create
in
one
programming
technology_9
and
handle
in
another
programming
technology_9
the
point
be
the
two
component_3
will
only
connector_15
through
the
connector_data_2
they
be
connector_11
to
each
other
which
mean
the
sender
and
receiver
have
low

such
a
name
and

an
exchange
connector_17

connector_19
the
connector_data_1
and
be
now
responsible
for

the
connector_data_1
the

type
bind
must
be
create
from
the

to
component_1
in
this
requirement_3
there
be
two
bind
to
two
different
component_2
from
the

connector_18
the
connector_data_1
into
the
component_2
quality_attribute_4
on

attribute
the
connector_data_2
stay
in
the

part

of
the
us
direct

a
deep
understand
of
the

and
how
or
when
you
should
use

be
find
in
part

technology_1
for
beginner
exchange

and
bind
direct
the
connector_data_1
be
connector_18
to
the
component_2
whose
bind
key
exactly
match
the
connector_9

for
example
if
the
component_1
be

exchange
connector_18
connector_data_2
to
all
of
the
component_2
bind
to
it
topic
the
topic
exchange
do
a
wildcard
match
between
the
connector_9

pattern_4
specify
in
the
bind


exchange
use
the
connector_data_1
attribute
for
connector_18
technology_1
and
component_6
concept
some
important
concept
need
to
be
describe
before
we
dig
deep
into
technology_1
the
default
virtual
component_20
the
default
component_12
and
the
default
permission
be
use
in
the
example
so
letâ€™s
go
over
the
element
and
concept
component_16
component_5
that
connector_16
the
connector_data_1
component_15
component_5
that
connector_19
the

buffer
that
connector_5
connector_data_1
connector_data_1
connector_data_3
that
be
connector_21
from
the
component_16
to
a
component_15
through
technology_1
connector_2
a
technology_10
connector_2
between
your
component_5
and
the
technology_1
pattern_1
pattern_5
a
virtual
connector_2
inside
a
connector_2
when
publish
or
connector_22
connector_data_2
from
a
component_1
it
s
all
do
over
a
pattern_5
exchange
connector_19
connector_data_2
from
component_14
and
connector_23
them
to
component_2
quality_attribute_4
on
rule
define
by
the
exchange
type
to
connector_24
connector_data_1
a
component_1
need
to
be
bind
to
at
least
one
exchange
bind
a
bind
be
a
connector_20
between
a
component_1
and
an
exchange
connector_9
key
a
key
that
the
exchange
look
at
to
decide
how
to
connector_25
the
connector_data_1
to
component_1
think
of
the
connector_9
key
an
connector_26
for
the
connector_data_1
technology_11
advance
connector_data_1
pattern_6
technology_12
be
the
technology_12
use
by
technology_1
for
connector_data_1
component_12
it
be
possible
to
connector_4
to
technology_1
with
a
give
username
and
password
every
component_12
can
be
assign
permission
such
a
right
to
connector_27
connector_28
and
configure
privilege
within
the
instance
component_11
can
also
be
assign
permission
for
specific
virtual
component_20
vhost
virtual
component_20
provide
a
way
to
segregate
component_3
use
the
same
technology_1
instance
different
component_11
can
have
different
permission
to
different
vhost
and
component_2
and
exchange
can
be
create
so
they
only
exist
in
one
vhost
at
the
begin
of
this
series
we
have
one
component_16
the
component_5
and
one
component_15
the
pdf
component_4
component_5
if
the
pdf
component_4
component_5
crash
or
if
many
pdf
connector_data_6
be
come
at
the
same
time
connector_data_2
would
continue
to
technology_13
up
in
the
component_1
until
the
component_15
start
again
it
would
then
component_4
all
the
connector_data_1
one
by
one
set
up
a

solution
mean
that
all
you
need
to
do
be
sign
up
for
