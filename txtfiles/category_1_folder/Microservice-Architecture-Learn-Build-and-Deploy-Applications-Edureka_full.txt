the
feature
simultaneously
with
the
introduction
of
feature
worldwide
be
quite
tough
to
be
handle

solutionto
avoid
such
problem
uber
decide
to
connector_17
it
architecture
and
follow
the
other
hyper
growth
requirement_14

netflix
twitter
and
many
others
thus
uber
decide
to
break
it
monolithic
architecture
into
multiple
codebases
to
form
a
pattern_1
architecture
refer
to
the
diagram
below
to
look
at
uber’s
pattern_1
architecture
figure

pattern_1
architecture
of
uber
–
pattern_1
architecture
the
major
connector_17
that
we
observe
here
be
the
introduction
of
component_10
gateway
through
which
all
the
driver
and
technology_32
be
connector_15
from
the
component_10
gateway
all
the
internal
point
be
connector_18
such
a
technology_32
requirement_9
driver
requirement_9
trip
requirement_9
and
others
the
unit
be
individual
separate
quality_attribute_4
unit
perform
separate
requirement_12
for
example
if
you
want
to
connector_17
anything
in
the
bill
pattern_4
then
you
have
to
quality_attribute_1
only
bill
pattern_4
and
don’t
have
to
quality_attribute_1
the
others
all
the
feature
be
now
quality_attribute_10
individually
i
e
the
interdependency
between
each
and
every
feature
be
remove
for
example
we
all
that
the
number
of
people
search
for
cab
be
more
comparatively
more
than
the
people
actually
book
a
cab
and
make
payment
this
connector_19
u
an
inference
that
the
number
of
component_21
work
on
the
technology_32
requirement_9
pattern_1
be
more
than
the
number
of
component_21
work
on
payment
in
this
way
uber
benefit
by
shift
it
architecture
from
