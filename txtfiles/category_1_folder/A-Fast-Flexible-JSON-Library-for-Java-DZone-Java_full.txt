t
we
already
have

why
another
technology_1
technology_2
i
find
myself
stick
in
a
couple
of
situation
and
jsoniter
technology_4
iterator
really
work
for
me
work
with
technology_5
you
want
to

so
they
might
give
you

or

you
want
an
connector_data_2
so
they
might
give
you
a
an
empty
connector_data_2
requirement_7
large
technology_1
connector_3
requirement_7
a
large
connector_3
of
technology_4
then
extract
only
what
you
need
from
the
jungle
cannot
bind
the
technology_1
be
organize
in
a
key
requirement_8
form
and
it
cannot
bind
directly
to
my
connector_data_2
component_2
also
jsoniter
be
much
much
fast
than
exist
technology_2
technology_6
technology_7
you
name
it
third
party
benchmarking
be
welcome
here
be
the
shameless
self
benchmarking
connector_data_3
for
connector_data_1
bind
1kb
of
technology_4
the
advantage
of
jsoniter
come
from
these
innovation
any
type
capture
raw
byte
a
the
any
type
requirement_7
be
do
lazily
any
can
be
use
a
technology_5
or
technology_8
connector_data_2
and
be
weakly
type
iterator
abstraction
take
the
technology_1
input
connector_3
a
an
iterator
connector_data_2
you
can
walk
through
the
graph
in
a
connector_4
way
iterate
collection
it
s
similar
to
the
technology_7
technology_9
but
greatly
simplify
trie
tree
the
big
drawback
and
maybe
it
big
benefit
of
technology_1
be
the
type
name
it
be
time
connector_5
to
bind
connector_data_2
by
compare

jsoniter
us
tri
tree
to
technology_10
the
requirement_6
generation
all
decoder
encoder
component_3
can
be
generate
you
have
plenty
of
option
quality_attribute_3
such
a
pattern_4
dynamic
codegen

codgen
only
pay
for
the
feature
you
want
take
inputstream
a
an
input
be
slow
than
byte
traditional
requirement_9
use
a
virtual
or
feature
flag
to
generalize
which
be
a
requirement_6
killer
jsoniter
us
dynamic
pattern_3
to
switch
implementation
require
validation
when
you
requirement_7
an
connector_data_2
of

you
can
not
tell
the
be
zero
because
no
input
from
technology_1
or
the
be
indeeded
specify
a
zero
jsoniter
connector_6
require
track
use
bit
mask
now
you
can

a
lot
of
work
have
be
do
to
make
sure
jsoniter
be
the
fast
out
there
benchmarking
aside
what
most
people
truly
want
be
to
connector_2
their
do
fast
here
be
an
example
to
show
you
how
quality_attribute_1
the
component_4
be

many
many
more
line
each
line
be
an

the
first
element
be
the
order

and
the
second
element
be
the
order
detail
notice
there
be
many
line
and
connector_7
them
all
in
once
will
lead
to
memory
issue
some
order

be
ints
and
some
be

this
be
very
common
when
work
with
technology_5
the

have

we

this

it
