introduction
to
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_1
and
technology_1
camelmiddlewaredevelopmentby
justin
reockin
this

we
discus
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_1
use
technology_1
technology_2
after
a
brief
intro
we
ll
connector_2
our
hand
dirty
with
some
technology_2
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_1
example
to
help
you
connector_2
start
what
be
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_1
why
use
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_1
with
camelenterprise
requirement_2
pattern_1
example
with
technology_1
camelapply
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_1
for
technology_2
with
help
from
openlogic
what
be
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_1
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_1
be
pattern_1
use
to
design
build
and
quality_attribute_1
pattern_2
solution
why
use
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_1
with
camelin
my
opinion
technology_2
be
one
of
the
best
way
to
create
sophisticate
requirement_1
requirement_2
workflow
by
combine
a
component_1
drive
approach
with
an
easy
to
understand
syntax
technology_2
allow
developer
to
federate
various
component_2
with
minimal

technology_2
be
design
a
a
programmatic
implementation
of
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_1
eip
a
an
architectural
design
pattern_1
eip
define

agnostic
workflow
for
common
requirement_3
connector_data_1
for
instance
the
“dynamic
router”
pattern_1
define
a
pattern_2
workflow
in
which
a
characteristic
of
a
connector_data_2
be
use
to
make
a
decision
on
where
to
connector_3
that
connector_data_2
visually
the
pattern_1
be
define
a
such
most
requirement_1
developer
have
connector_4
component_3
this
in
the
above
image
connector_data_3
with
a
green
square
characteristic
be
connector_5
to
the
“widget
inventory”
whereas
one
with
an
orange
diamond
characteristic
be
connector_5
to
the
“gadget”
inventory
another
eip
be
the
“content
enricher”
pattern_1
in
this
pattern_1
we
begin
with
a
basic
connector_data_2
we
then
query
some
sort
of
resource
perhaps
a
component_4
or
a
component_5
and
enrich
the
connector_data_2
with
connector_data_4
from
that
resource
again
most
developer
have
connector_4
similar
component_3
so
the
goal
of
eip
be
to
create
a
common
vocabulary
and
set
of
workflow
action
that
can
be
combine
together
to
create
sophisticate
requirement_3
component_6
build
your
open_source
stackapache
technology_2
be
likely
one
piece
of
your
requirement_1
open_source
technology_4
use
the
openlogic
technology_4
builder
to
build
your
technology_4
you
ll
connector_2
a
report
complete
with
recommendation
from
open_source
expert
to
help
you
improve
your
technology_4
build
your
stackenterprise
requirement_2
pattern_1
example
with
technology_1
camelhere
be
some
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_1
example
use
technology_1
technology_2
why
technology_1
technology_2
so
what
do
any
of
this
have
to
do
with
technology_1
technology_2
well
basically
everything
technology_2
provide
a
technology_5
that
can
build
these
pattern_1
use
a
basic
syntax
it
take
a
connector_data_2
drive
approach
to
requirement_2
where
connector_data_3
contain
connector_data_4
connector_data_5
that
can
be
shuttle
around
through
various

the
themselves
be
connector_6
use
technology_2
component_1
and
there
be
a
lot
of
them
technology_2
connector_7
be
highly
quality_attribute_2
they
can
be
run
standalone
quality_attribute_1
in
a
servlet
container
wrap
a
technology_6
blueprint
and
more
technology_2
syntaxcamel’s
syntax
be
inspire
by
the
unix
pipeline
in
unix
we
might
connector_8
something
p
fe
|
grep
foo
when
we
run
this
command
the
output
of
the
p
command
become
the
input
to
the
grep
command
we
“pipe”
the
output
of
one
command
into
the
input
of
another
command
technology_2
chain
these
action
together
in
an
connector_data_6
connector_9
an
exchange
which
consist
of
an
input
connector_data_2
connector_data_7
the
“in”
connector_data_2
some
sort
of
processor

a
component_1
for
instance
and
possibly
an
output
or
“out”
connector_data_2
if
the
processor
be
mean
to
provide
a
pattern_3
connector_10
a
series
of
exchange
state
connector_11
create
a
technology_2
connector_12
the
magic
here
be
that
these
processor
can
be
anything
they
can
be
an
requirement_2
component_1
they
can
be
a
custom
processor
and
they
can
be
some
sort
of
connector_data_4
transformer
the
sky
be
the
limit
technology_2
routeconsider
the
follow
technology_2
connector_12
example
technology_2
connector_12
filexlatethis
be
a
connector_data_2
that
say
${body}
that
come
from
a
filename
of
${headers
camelfilename}this
connector_12
begin
use
camel’s
“file”
component_1
which
allow
the
connector_12
to
connector_13
with
a
local
component_7
in
this
requirement_4
we’re
create
a
component_8
that
will
watch
a
directory
connector_9
“
tmp
inputfiles
”
any
time
a
be
create
in
this
directory
the
content
of
that
will
become
the
first
input
connector_data_2
on
the
connector_12
we
then
perform
a
quality_attribute_3
transform
use
the
reserve
command
which
transform
the
body
of
the
connector_data_2
in
this
requirement_4
we’re
use
one
of
camel’s
build
in
script
technology_5
to
provide
connector_14
to
the
connector_data_2
content
use
the
${}
property
syntax
component_9
tend
to
append
relevant

to
connector_data_3
that
move
through
them
the
component_1
provide
many

and
a
useful
one
be
the
camelfilename
which
retain
the
name
of
the
that
be
be
component_6
finally
we
connector_3
that
connector_data_8
to
the
technology_2
“activemq”
component_1
which
allow
for
requirement_2
with
the
technology_7
connector_data_2
pattern_4
so
effectively
three
small
block
of

we
create
a
component_8
transform
the
connector_data_2
connector_data_8
and
create
a
technology_8
component_10
which
will
connector_5
the
file’s
content
a
a
technology_8
connector_data_2
to
an
technology_7
pattern_4
powerful
stuff
apply
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_1
for
technology_2
with
help
from
openlogicthere’s
a
lot
to
this
technology_5
and
this
barely
scratch
the
surface
of
what
can
be
achieve
use
this
valuable
technology_9
if
you
want
to
truly
leverage
requirement_1
requirement_2
pattern_1
example

a
technology_1
technology_2
you
ll
need
to
enlist

help
of
the
