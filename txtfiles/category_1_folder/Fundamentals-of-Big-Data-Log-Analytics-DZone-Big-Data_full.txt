present
a
brand
talk
at
oop
in
munich
“comparison
of
technology_4
and
technology_2
for
requirement_1
requirement_2
requirement_3
and
it
analytics”
the
focus
of
the
talk
be
to
discus
different
open_source
technology_4
pattern_3
requirement_5
offer
and
requirement_8
technology_5
for
analyze
big
mass
of
quality_attribute_2
requirement_2

this
topic
be
connector_3
much
more
traction
these
day
with
the
emerge

concept
of

requirement_3
enable

requirement_10

other
requirement_1
componentslog
requirement_10
with
papertrail
elk
technology_6
technology_3
loglogic
splunk
etc
requirement_2
requirement_10
have
be
a
mature
concept
for
many
year
use
for
troubleshoot
root
cause
analysis
and
solve
quality_attribute_1
issue
of
component_3
such
a
web
component_4
firewall
pattern_4
component_1
etc
in
the
meantime
it
be
also
use
for
analyze
component_5
and
quality_attribute_2
deployment
use

or

grow
strongly
100%
year
by
year
accord
to
gartner
in
contrary
to
requirement_2
requirement_10
it
do
not
focus
on
analyze
historical
connector_data_1
but
also
enable
to
make
complex
correlation
of
quality_attribute_2
connector_data_1
to
allow
predictive
requirement_3
in
near
real
time
technology_3
unity
be
a
technology_5
head
into
this
direction
you
can
quality_attribute_3
requirement_2
connector_data_1
but
also
real
time
e
g
via
technology_3
hawk
to
enable
pattern_6
analysis
and
complex
correlation
of
quality_attribute_2
microserices
what
about
technology_7
technology_8
versus
requirement_2
requirement_10
and
itoa
why
not
use
technology_7
technology_8
you
can
also
component_7
and
analyze
all
connector_data_1
on
it
cluster
why
not
use
requirement_2
collector
such
a
technology_7
technology_9
and
connector_4
connector_data_1
directly
to
technology_8
without
requirement_2
requirement_3
“in
the
middle”
here
be
some
reasons…
requirement_2
requirement_10
and
itoa
technology_2
be
an
quality_attribute_3
solution
for
connector_data_1
analysis
technology_2
consult
support
be
build
exactly
for
these
use
requirement_12
involve
connector_data_1
index
connector_data_1
component_8
query
and
connector_data_1
visualization
by
mean
of
requirement_13
and
other
technology_2
out
of
the
component_9
offer
easy
of
use
technology_2
and
allow
fast
time
to
requirement_11
low
tco
the
follow
graphic
show
the
different
concept
and
when
they
be
usually
use
have
say
that
a
quality_attribute_4
technology_8
requirement_6
be
possible
it
might
make
sense
to
leverage
both
together
the
great
technology_2
for
requirement_2
requirement_10
plus
the
technology_8
storage
with
very
high
quality_attribute_5
for
really
requirement_1
for
example
technology_3
unity
us
technology_7
technology_10
under
the
hood
to
support
component_8
and
quality_attribute_6
million
of
connector_data_2
thus
requirement_6
with
technology_8
storage
might
be
possible
in
a
future
release…
