to
the
issue
and
constraint
of
monolithic

because
monolithic
component_2
tend
to
grow
in
size
and
scope
over
time
the
tight
couple
between

lead
to
slow
more
challenge

a
such

take
on

high

of

which
increase
every
time
a

be
often
achieve
by
decouple
a

into

that

contain

the
number
of

can
release
to

additionally
monolithic
component_2
make
it
hard
to
quality_attribute_3
and
replace
individual
component_4
because
any
connector_5
make
—
big
or
small
—
have
an
impact
on
the
entire
component_3
in
this
we’ll
answer
the
question
about
what
pattern_1
be
and
why
they
be
important
and
discus
how
pattern_1
differ
from
monolithic
architecture
we’ll
also
look
at
the
pro
con
and
when
it
make
sense
to
pursue
this
initiative
what
be
the
type
of
pattern_1
there
be
two
type
of
pattern_1
stateless
and
stateful
the
core
difference
between
the
two
come
down
to
whether
the
component_5
retain
component_8
of
connector_6
between
each
or
not
here
we’ll
quickly
break
down
the
pro
and
con
of
each
stateless
pattern_1
one
of
the
type
of
pattern_1
stateless
pattern_1
be
ideal
for
quality_attribute_4
component_9
in
this
requirement_2
each
connector_data_1
be
treat
a
an
independent
unit
with
no
component_10
from
previous
iteration
the
benefit
be
that
stateless
component_4
can
easily
be
replace
without
the
risk
of
pass
on
problem
lurk
inside
the
old
stateless
pattern_1
don’t
keep
component_8
of
component_11
state
between
connector_data_1
this
mean
that
if
some
part
of
a
component_1
instance
be
remove
it
won’t
impact
the
component_12
component_13
for
that
component_1
stateful
pattern_1
on
the
flipside
stateful
component_5
be
a
type
of
pattern_1
that
connector_7
component_11
connector_data_2
right
there
in
the
this
way
when
two
or
more
component_5
connector_4
they
automatically
keep
a
component_14
of
component_5
perform
while
there
be
a
wide
range
of
use
requirement_2
in
which
stateless
component_5
make
sense
there
be
a
many
reason
organization
need
to
retain
that
connector_data_2
for
example
something
stateless
online
bank
wouldn’t
work
a
the
component_5
wouldn’t
keep
historical
component_8
of
deposit
and
withdrawal
—
present
some
serious
problem
for

what

use
for
the
short
answer
be
pattern_1
be
use
to
connector_8
the

with

about

the

for

if
you’re
build

from

we
often
recommend
start
with

a
a
proof
of

after
determine

the
next

would
be

offer
great
quality_attribute_20
when
it
come

a
compare

and
they
often
come
with
lower

and
quality_attribute_18
cost
a
pattern_1
increase
the

of

for
these
reason
we
recommend
that
start
up
at

consider
the
pro

con
of
build
a

on

the

requirement_1
do
make
small
connector_14
to
my
component_3
require
me
to
perform
expensive
and
timely
redeployment
of
the
entire
suite
could
my
internal
and
external
component_22
benefit
from
feature
be
quality_attribute_2
in
a
timelier
manner
will
fast
deployment
help
u
reach
requirement_11
fast
and
make
u
more
competitive
in
our
space
will
decouple
our
current
component_3
strengthen
our
component_9
and
connector_data_6
in
increase
quality_attribute_23
do
our
monolithic
component_3
component_23
a
large
amount
of
requirement_6
that
be
unneeded
be
our
current
component_3
able
to
effectively
utilize
the
quality_attribute_11
and
quality_attribute_15
offer
by
the
requirement_9
do
certain
component_5
need
to
be
able
to
quality_attribute_12
rapidly
and
on
demand
could
you
benefit
from
leverage
the
feature
of
multiple
programming
technology_2
for
specific
part
of
your
component_3
be
you
deal
with
large
amount
of
connector_data_3
that
have
heterogeneous
characteristic
where
individual
component_5
could
benefit
from
utilize
their
own
connector_data_3
component_18
polyglot
persistence
in
pattern_1
in
a
monolithic
and
pattern_4
architecture
a
single
connector_data_3
component_18
must
be
utilize
across
all
component_1
unfortunately
the
large
connector_data_3
volume
involve
in
large
component_2
feature
connector_data_3
that
have
extremely
vary
characteristic
and
requirement
for
component_12
a
single
connector_data_3
component_18
be
often
not
the
ideal
approach
to
connector_data_4
and
component_12
all
the
set
of
connector_data_3
that
can
be
connector_18
by
an
component_3
in
a
pattern_1
architecture
each
component_1
be
able
to
utilize
it
own
connector_data_3
component_18
leave
developer
free
to
choose
the
component_24
type
that
best
fit
the
characteristic
and
component_12
requirement
of
the
component_1
the
ability
of
an
component_3
to
choose
different
component_24
technology_3
for
individual
component_5
be
a
polyglot
persistence
below
be
an
example
of
what
connector_data_3
persistence
look
in
a
monolithic
component_1
orient
and
pattern_1
architecture
pattern_1
container
and
pattern_12
container
allow
individual
component_5
to
be
quality_attribute_2
independently
and
without
the
unnecessary
requirement
of
have
to
quality_attribute_2
a
full
embed
o
a
with
virtual
component_25
with
container
component_5
be
pattern_13
with
a
lightweight
run
time
environment
each
container
include
everything
require
for
the
component_1
to
run
this
make
container
a
quality_attribute_24
fit
for
pattern_1
a
it
increase
the
quality_attribute_10
at
which
component_2
can
be
quality_attribute_2
increase
fault
resistance
and
enable
them
to
work
across
component_26
by
far
the
most
popular
technology_7
for
build
component_18
and
run
container
be
technology_9
ok
so
you
have
your
container
now
what
now
you
will
need
a
centralized
way
to
efficiently
arrange
coordinate
and
manage
your
component_5
to
align
with
requirement_1
connector_data_1
this
be
accomplish
with
a
container
pattern_12
technology_7
these
technology_7
enable
component_16
to
quality_attribute_12
automatically
and
reduce
the
time
require
to
quality_attribute_2
multiple
instance
of
a
single
component_3
there
be
several
container
pattern_12
technology_7
on
the
requirement_11
currently
the
most
popular
container
pattern_12
technology_7
be
technology_10
technology_10
be
often
use
in
conjunction
with
technology_9
to
pattern_14
technology_9
container
now
that
you
the
answer
to
what
be

why
be
