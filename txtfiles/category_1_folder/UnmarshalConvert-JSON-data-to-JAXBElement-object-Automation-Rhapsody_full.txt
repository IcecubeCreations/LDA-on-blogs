summary
how
to
marshal
and
unmarshal
jaxbelement
to
technology_1
with
technology_2
this
give
solution
for
follow
usecase
usecase
connector_data_3
document
pojo
contain
jaxbelement
technology_1
pojo
contain
jaxbelement
for
some
reason
there
be
a
pojo
which
have
some
jaxbelement
this
usually
happen
when
mix
technology_3
and
pattern_1
component_1
with
connector_data_3
and
technology_4
this
pojo
be
easily
convert
to
technology_1
connector_data_1
then
from
this
technology_1
connector_data_1
a
pojo
contain
jaxbelement
have
to
be
unmarshalled
problem
by
default
jackson’s
objectmapper
be
unable
to
unmarshal
technology_1
connector_data_1
into
a
jaxbelement
connector_data_2
an
exception
be
throw
no
suitable
constructor
find
for
type
quality_attribute_1
type
javax
technology_5
bind
jaxbelement
cannot
instantiate
from
technology_1
connector_data_2
miss
default
constructor
or
creator
or
perhaps
need
to
enable
type
connector_data_4
solution
although
somewhere
it
be
recommend
to
use
technology_6
fasterxml
technology_2
technology_7
jaxbannotationmodule
it
might
not
work
the
solution
be
to
create
custom
mixin
and
register
it
with
objectmapper
mixin
be
javax
technology_5
bind
jaxbelement
javax

conclusion
jackson’s
objectmapper
do
not
support
technology_1
to
jaxbelement
conversion
by
default
this
be
solve
by
create
a
custom
