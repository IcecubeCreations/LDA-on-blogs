“another

so
in

you
will
end
up
create
lot
of
custom

type
–
normally
one

type
associate
with
one
resource
put
in
this
way
imho
i
think
the
sentence
be
mislead
connector_21
the
phrase
what
i
understand
be
that
for
each
resource
i
must
create
a
custom

type
for
example
component_11
vnd
book+json
component_11
vnd
author+json
and
component_11
vnd
user+json
if
my
component_11
handle
book
author
and
component_12
resource
albeit
this
be
not
forbid
by
the
pattern_1
principle
i
think
that
a
more
appropriate
sentence
would
be
so
in
practice
you
can
end
up
create
lot
of
custom

type
–
potentially
one

type
associate
with
one
