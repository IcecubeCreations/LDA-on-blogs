what
be
pattern_1
pattern_1
be
a
pattern_3
architecture
pattern_4
wherein
component_6
be
build
a
a
collection
of
various
small
independent
component_7
unit
it
be
a
engineering
approach
that
focus
on
decompose
an
component_8
into
single
with
well
define
these
can
be
independently
quality_attribute_2
and
operate
by
small
team
that
own
the
entire
lifecycle
of
the
component_7
the
term
“micro”
refer
to
the
size
of
a
pattern_5
which
must
be
quality_attribute_3
by
a

team
to

best
practice
of
pattern_1
architecture
what
be
monolithic
architecture
in
layman
term
you
can
say
that
monolithic
architecture
be
a
big
container
in
which
all
the
component_9
of
an
component_8
be
club
into
a
single
package
let’s
discus
an
example
of
an
ecommerce
component_10
in
component_11
of
a
monolithic
architecture
monolithic
architecture
of
ecommerce
component_8
in
any
e
commerce
component_8
there
be
some
technology_48
feature
search
review
&
rat
and
payment
these
feature
be
quality_attribute_4
to
requirement_8
use
their
browser
or
component_12
when
the
developer
of
the
ecommerce
quality_attribute_2
the
component_8
it
be
a
single
monolithic
unit
the
for
different
feature
search
review
&
rat
and
payment
be
on
the
same
component_2
to
quality_attribute_5
the
component_8
you
need
to
run
multiple
instance
component_2
of
these
component_8
what
be
pattern_5
architecture
pattern_5
architecture
be
an
architectural
development
style
that
allow
build
component_6
a
a
collection
of
small
autonomous
component_3
develop
for
a
requirement_3
domain
it
be
a
variant
of
structural
style
architecture
that
help
arrange
component_6
a
a
loosely
couple
component_7
collection
the
pattern_5
architecture
contain
fine
grain
component_3
and
lightweight
technology_49
let’s
take
an
example
of
e
commerce
component_8
develop
with
pattern_5
architecture
in
this
pattern_1
architecture
example
each
pattern_5
be
focus
on
single
requirement_3
capability
search
rat
&
review
and
payment
each
have
their
instance
component_2
and
connector_2
with
each
other
pattern_1
architecture
in
monolithic
architecture
all
the
component_9
coalesce
into
a
single
but
in
pattern_1
architecture
they
be
spread
into
individual
pattern_5
which
connector_2
with
each
other
a
show
in
the
pattern_1
example
above
the
connector_3
between
pattern_1
be
a
stateless
connector_3
where
each
pair
of
connector_data_2
and
connector_4
be
independent
hence
pattern_1
can
connector_2
effortlessly
in
the
pattern_5
architecture
the
connector_data_1
be
federate
each
pattern_5
have
it
separate
connector_data_1
component_10
next
in
this
technology_6
pattern_1
we
will
about
the
difference
between
pattern_1
and
monolithic
architecture
pattern_1
vs
monolithic
architecture
pattern_1
monolithic
architecture
every
unit
of
the
entire
component_8
should
be
the
small
and
it
should
be
able
to
connector_5
one
specific
requirement_3
goal
a
single
base
for
all
requirement_3
goal
component_7
startup
be
relatively
quick
component_7
startup
take
more
time
fault
isolation
be
easy
even
if
one
component_7
go
down
other
can
continue
to
fault
isolation
be
difficult
if
any
specific
feature
be
not
work
the
complete
component_5
go
down
in
order
to
handle
this
issue
the
component_8
need
to
re
build
re
test
and
also
re
quality_attribute_2
all
pattern_1
should
be
loosely
couple
so
that
connector_6
make
in
one
do
not
affect
the
other
monolithic
architecture
be
tightly
couple
connector_6
in

of
affect
the

requirement_3
can

that
be
generate

since
component_3

not
possible
more
hardware
resource
could
be
allocate
to
the
component_7
that
be
frequently

e
commerce
example
above
more
number
of
component_13
connector_7
the

so
