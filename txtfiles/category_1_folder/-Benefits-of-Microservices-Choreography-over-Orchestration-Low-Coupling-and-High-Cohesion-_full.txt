introduction
most
people
think
a
pattern_4
architecture
be
quality_attribute_4
for
build
quality_attribute_5
component_5
this
isn’t
false
but
we
should
have
a
close
look
at
which
dimension
this
architecture
style
quality_attribute_6
at
it
best
the
dimension
that
come
into
people’s
mind
first
be
the
dimension
of
load
this
mean
it
should
be
possible
to
additional
resource
to
keep
the
requirement_1
the
same
when
workload
increase
in
fact
this
be
not
for
what
pattern_1
be
quality_attribute_4
for
in
the
first
place
the
dimension
the
pattern_4
architecture
quality_attribute_6
be
the
functional
dimension
in
other
word
it
be
easy
to
introduce
and
quality
at
any
stage
of
the
technology_1
this
lead
to
the
consideration
that
it’s
simply
possible
to
technology_2
to
imminent
load
problem
with
requirement
this

explain
the
purpose
and
risk
of
pattern_4
architecture
it
further
give
some
hint
on
how
an
architecture
must
look
to
meet
these
purpose
at
some
point
it
also
compare
pattern_4
to
traditional
component_6
orient
architecture
technology_3
purpose

minimize
cost
of
connector_2
purpose
pattern_1
be
intend
to
quality_attribute_6
accord
to
requirement
minimize
the
cost
for
or
connector_2
requirement
be
the
major
purpose
of
the
pattern_4
architecture
style
this
benefit
come
directly
from
the
“single
responsibility
principle”
the
pattern_1
pattern_5
prescribe
radical
rule
to
enforce
this
principle
in
order
to
maximize
it
benefit
to
prevent
that
be

where
it
doesn’t
belong
to
and
to
ensure
changeability
the
pattern_4
pattern_5
recommend
that
different
responsibility
be
place
in
different
component_3
each
component_6
have
it
own
pattern_6
each
instance
of
a
pattern_4
be
connector_3
a
a
dedicate
component_7
inter
component_6
connector_4
be
only
allow
through
a
requirement_2
connector_5
in
addition
component_3
must
use
it
official
component_8
to
talk
to
each
other
it
be
not
allow
that
one
component_6
connector_6
the
connector_data_1
of
component_9
that
have
be
connector_1
by
another
component_6
each
component_6
must
have
it
own
logical
component_9
schema
the
technology_4
use
for
connector_4
must
be
technology_5
agnostic
quality_attribute_7
this
mean
a
component_6
should
not
assume
that
another
component_6
be
connector_1
in
a
specific
programming
technology_6
choreography
should
be
prefer
over
pattern_2
some
of
these
principle
might
remind
u
on
a
traditional
component_6
orient
architecture
technology_3
in
fact
each
pattern_4
architecture
be
a
component_6
orient
architecture
but
not
the
other
way
around
there
be
some
discussion
whether
pattern_1
be
pattern_7
do
right
the
difference
that
make
a
component_6
orient
architecture
a
pattern_4
architecture
be
you
guess
it
a
small
component_3
size
and
lightweight
technology_4
the
small
component_6
size
be
a
connector_data_2
of
apply
the
first
principle
from
the
connector_data_3
above
place
different
responsibility
into
different
component_6
late
in
this

we’ll
have
a
close
look
on
how
to
decide
which
responsibility
go
together
into
one
component_6
and
which
should
be
quality_attribute_4
separate
for
now
we
assume
that
a
well
do
pattern_4
architecture
be
in
place
and
examine
how
each
of
the
rule
above
contribute
to
a
lower
cost
of
connector_2
enforce
pattern_3
because
of
hard
component_2
boundary
pattern_3
in
architecture
be
a
measure
how
relate
the
responsibility
of
a
be
saip
s

so
when
a
have
responsibility
that
be
strongly
relate
to
each
other
this
have
a
high
pattern_3
attention
don’t
fall
into
the
trap
and
put
relate
responsibility
into
different
component_6
because
different
responsibility
be
place
in
different
pattern_6
it
be
much
hard
to
place
into
to
which
they
don’t
belong
to
by
design
this
be
a
common
problem
in
traditional
component_5
developer
will
eventually
ignore
or
oversee
boundary
of
subsystem
due
to
time
pressure
or
insufficient
understand
of
the
large
base
a
a
consequence
of
that
relate
component_10
be
quality_attribute_3
across
component_2
boundary
and
it
be
much
hard
to
maintain
and
extend
the

subsequently
the
test
suite
connector_7
also
more
complex
and
this
be
another
reason
why
it
s
hard
to
ensure
that
everything
be
still
work
after
a
connector_2
lower
couple
because
of
high
pattern_3
low

often
correlate
with
high

and
vice
versa
sadcw
in
a
quality_attribute_4

the
connector_8

minimize
one
reason
for
that
be
the
same
a
for
the

it
be
hard
for

to
introduce

even
if
there

furthermore
because

the

that

the

connector_15
it

and
than
extend
the
component_2
over
time
apply
a
pattern_4
architecture
be
not
about
build
the
perfect
component_2
instead
it
be
about
to
build
a
technology_8
in
which
a
quality_attribute_4
component_2
can
emerge
over

a
the
understand
grow
bm
s

however
a
still
exist
problem
be
that
responsibility
be
assign
to
the
wrong
component_6
by
design
when
it
come
to
design
a
pattern_4
architecture
many
people
don’t
how
to
divide
a
monolithic
problem
into
multiple
micro
component_6
and
in
fact
when
the
component_3
be
too
big
or
to
small
the
advantage
be
go
and
problem
arise
this
then
bother
developer
and
also
the
manager
who
decide
to
invest
into
this
architecture
style
hint
make
component_3
too
small
be
common
pitfall
this
antipattern
be
connector_16
“nanoservices”
so

have
a
look
at
the
most
ask
question
in
discussion
about
pattern_1
how
small
a
component_6
should
be
the
follow
section
encourage
generalization
replaceability
and
quality_attribute_1
should
give
you
an
idea
on
how
to
approach
this
problem
purpose

encourage
generalization
replaceability
and
quality_attribute_1
purpose
in
pattern_1
the
lesson

from
pattern_7
be
apply
to
fulfil
the
promise
of
quality_attribute_1
quality_attribute_1
component_3
be
an
old
idea
and
in
component_6
orient
architecture
technology_3
this
be
a
fundamental
goal
the
pattern_4
architecture
style
promote
the
follow
principle
to
reach
the
best
quality_attribute_11
for
a
single
component_6
build
small
component_3
do
one
thing
well
this
be
similar
to
the
rule
from
the
section
above
different
responsibility
should
be
place
in
different
component_6
a
typical
show
stopper
in
discussion
about
quality_attribute_1
an
exist
component_6
be
it
complexity
and
that
the
exist
solution
do
much
more
then
actual
require
often
you
hear
statement
“this
be
a
quality_attribute_9
problem
we
quality_attribute_4
build
our
own
solution
instead
of

how
to
use
an
exist
one”
to
make
thing
bad
a
complex
go
along
with
a
complex
documentation
how
often
do
you
hear
a
colleague
complain
about
a
documentation
there
be
some
rule
of
thumb
out
there
how
small
a
pattern_4
should
be
the
component_6
can
be
rewrite
and
redeploy
in

week
jon
eaves
it
must
be
possible
to
fee
a
team
that
maintain
a
component_6
with
two
pizza
werner
vogels
these
be
quality_attribute_4
rule
of
thumb
and
one
could
argue
that
these
be
extreme
example
two
week
two
rewrite
a
component_6
be
a
desirable
time
range
but
accord
to
the
pizza
example
i
must
always
work
in
a
one
man
team
to
connector_17
a
well
design
pattern_4
architecture
we
should
not
ask
how
big
a
component_6
should
be
instead
we
should
ask
which
responsibility
should
go
into
the
same
component_6
my
opinionated
answer
to
this
be
that
responsibility
should
be
group
in
a
way
so
that
the
amount
and
size
of
domain
specific
component_3
be
minimize
domain
specific
component_6
in
this
component_15
be
component_3
that
be
specific
to
the
problem
domain
and
that
it
s
unlikely
to
find
a
scenario
for
quality_attribute_1
them
in
other
project
conversely
this
mean
the
amount
of
quality_attribute_1
or
quality_attribute_12
component_3
should
be
maximize
in
order
master
that
challenge
i
to
think
of
two
dimension
of
decomposition
decomposition
dimension

action
on

action
that
require
connector_6
to
the
same
component_9
component_16
should
go
into
the
component_8
of
same
component_6
for
example
create
connector_11
update
and
delete
an
component_12
e
g
a
component_14
should
be
provide
by
the
component_8
of
the
same
component_6
recap
it’s
a
no
go
that
more
then
one
component_6
connector_6
the
same
component_9
since
it
break
up
pattern_3
see
section
‘purpose

when
a

a
require

of

b
component_6
a
must
use
the

of

b
furthermore
component_4
that
have
a
strong
relation
to
each
other
be
quality_attribute_4
candidate
to
be
manage
by
the
same
component_6
from
the
perspective
of
quality_attribute_1
a
component_6
when
you
can’t
think
of
a
scenario
where
you
use
an
component_12
without
the
other
it’s
an
indication
that
those
component_4
should
be
quality_attribute_4
manage
by
the
same
component_6
decomposition
dimension

aspect
of
an
action
because
an
action
be
provide
by
the
component_8
of
one
component_6
it
doesn’t
mean
that
every
aspect
of
that
action
must
be
connector_3
by
that
component_6
it
be
often
possible
to
decompose
a
domain
specific
action
into
one
or
more
generic
action
in
such
requirement_3
we
should
think
to
leave
those
aspect
of
an
action
to
other
component_6
a
quality_attribute_9
example
when
a
component_14
sign
up
at
an
online
shop
an
to
this
component_14
should
be
connector_18
it
be
a
quality_attribute_4
idea
to
use
an
component_6
to
connector_18
out
those

why
in
requirement_3
the
layout
of
all

should
be
connector_2
each
component_6
that
connector_19

must
be
connector_2
connector_20

be
such
a
generic
problem
that
there
be
ton
of
component_3
out
there
that
can
be
quality_attribute_1
a
more
complex
example
when
a
requirement_5
of
an
online
shop
pattern_10
a
technology_1
the
shop
component_2
should
remember
this
in
order
to
generate
component_14
specific
advertisement
in
this
example
we
have
a
component_6
that
manage
technology_1
put
the
component_10
to
generate
component_14
specific
advertisement
would
blow
up
the
complexity
of
the
technology_1
component_6
instead
we
should
make
a
research
which
off
the
shelf
can
perform
such
component_14
specific
advertisement
and
use
this
component_2
along
with
the
technology_1
component_6
whenever
technology_1
connector_data_9
connector_7

by
an
component_14
the

component_6

when
an

on

to

maybe
your

one
component_6
act

connector_22
the
connector_data_1
component_16
from
the
wristband
to
keep
the
first
component_6
quality_attribute_9
this
component_6
be
responsible
to
connector_23
and
dispatch
the
connector_data_1
component_18
to
component_19
and
analyze
the
heart
rate
we
need
something
a
“heart

service”
that
be
able
to
calculate
the
average
heart
rate
of
a
give
time
period
in
the
past
because
we
want
to
display
this
connector_data_9
to

component_14
make
a
generalization
step
before
connector_24
a
heart
rate
component_6
can
connector_25
u
a
lot
of
work
the
heart
rate
component_6
be
actually
a
time
series
component_9
that
can

use
off

shelf
purpose

increase
quality_attribute_2
purpose
only
quality_attribute_6
the
bottleneck
in
sum
the
footprint
of
an
pattern_4
architecture
be
usually
big
then
the
footprint
of
a
monolithic
component_5
this
be
because
in
a
pattern_4
architecture
each
component_6
must
run
a
a
separate
component_7
this
mean
each
instance
of
a
component_6
require
it
own
runtime
e
g
technology_9
technology_10
pattern_11
etc
hint
the
serverless
architecture
pattern_5
mitigate
this
cost
by
use
the
same
runtime
for
different
component_6
but
there
be
a
break
even
point
when
it
come
to
horizontal
quality_attribute_6
when
quality_attribute_13
a
monolithic
component_5
horizontally
you
must
install
the
whole
monolith
multiple
time
this
be
a
kind
of
waste
because
often
only
a
small
part
of
the
component_5
become
the
bottleneck
with
a
pattern_4
architecture
you
can
only
quality_attribute_6
those
part
that
actually
have
requirement_1
issue
for
component_20
under
constant
high
load
the
hardware
resource
be
cheap
when
a
pattern_4
architecture
be
in
place
risk

increase
complexity
risk
one
disadvantage
of
the
pattern_4
architecture
be
obvious
it
be
necessary
to
operate
much
more
component_13
than
one
or

mature
