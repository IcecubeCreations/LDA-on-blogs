this
show
how
to
use
jakarta
technology_1
bind
to
deserialize
technology_1
connector_data_1
into
technology_5
pojos
and
to
serialize
technology_5
pojos
into
technology_1
connector_data_1
the
jakarta
technology_1
bind
technology_6
use
be
technology_2
johnzon
to
connector_1
start
you
will
need
to
clone
the
jsonb
basic

project
on
technology_7
create
a
directory
on
your
desktop
or
somewhere
and
connector_2
the
follow
git
command
git
clone
technology_8
technology_7
technology_9
tomitribe
jsonb
basic

git
assume
you
have
technology_10
instal
your
next
step
be
to
go
into
the
jsonb
basic

directory
and
connector_2
the
technology_10
install
command
mvn
install
the
jsonb
basic

us
mock
technology_1
connector_data_1
from
mockaroo
technology_9
the
technology_1
connector_data_1
be
component_3
in
a
name
mock_data
technology_11
locate
in
the
jsonb
basic

directory
it’s
a
technology_1
contain
one
thousand
connector_data_2
that
be
pattern_1
the
example
below
{


first_name
darill
last_name
kilroy


protect
gender
male
ip_address




}
{


first_name
enrico
last_name
yorston


protect
gender
male
ip_address




}
i
create
a
quality_attribute_1
person
pojo
with
the
correct
mapping
to
enable
marshal
between
technology_1
connector_data_1
and
technology_5
pojos
in
this
requirement_2
all
i
have
to
do
be
make
sure
the
technology_5
name
match
the
technology_1
name
a
show
below
and
then
technology_5
component_4
getters
and
setter
package
example
person
{
bind
private

private
first_name
private
last_name
private

private
gender
private
ip_address
getid
{

}
setid


{
this

=

}
getfirst_name
{
first_name
}
setfirst_name

first_name
{
this
first_name
=
first_name
}
**
and
so
on
for
all
of
the
*
}
use
jakarta
technology_1
bind
you
can
connector_3
technology_1
connector_data_1
into
technology_5
connector_data_2
easily
all
you
need
to
do
be
create
a
javax
technology_11
bind
jsonb
instance
use
the
johnzonbuilder
and
pass
it
a
properly
define
type
–
in
this
requirement_2
we
be
use
a
connector_data_3
person
type
connector_3
the
technology_1
into
a
technology_5
lang

to

that
it
work
look
at
the

under
the

directory
and
you’ll
see
that
it
be
a
syntactic
duplicate
of
the
original
this
demonstrate
that
technology_2
johnzon
successfully
deserialized

serialize
the

feel
free
to
explore
both
the
