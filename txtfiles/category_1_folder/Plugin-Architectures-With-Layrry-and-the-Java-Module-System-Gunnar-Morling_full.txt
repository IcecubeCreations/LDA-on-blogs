at

make
component_2
quality_attribute_1
with
some
form
of
plug
in
be
a
very
common
pattern_1
in
design
base
on
well
define
component_3
provide
by
the
component_4
core
plug
in
can
customize
an
applicationâ€™s
behavior
and
provide
requirement_1
example
include
desktop
component_2
ides
or
web
browser
build
technology_2
such
a
technology_3
technology_4
or
gradle
a
well
a
component_5
side
component_2
such
a
technology_3
technology_5
connector_1
a
runtime
for
technology_5
connector
plug
in
in
this
iâ€™m
go
to
explore
how
the
technology_1
component_6
component_1
s
notion
of
pattern_2
can
be
leverage
for
connector_2
plug
in
architecture
on
the
technology_6
weâ€™ll
also
discus
how
layrry
a
launcher
and
runtime
for
pattern_2
technology_1
component_4
can
help
with
this
connector_data_1
a
key
requirement
for
any
plug
in
architecture
be
strong
isolation
between
different
plug
in
their
state
and
connector_3
should
be
pattern_3
and
independent
of
each
other
e
g
package
declaration
in
two
plug
in
should
not
collide
also
they
should
be
able
to
use
different
version
of
another
3rd
party
connector_3
this
be
why
the
default
path
of
technology_1
specify
use
the
path
option
be
not
enough
for
this
purpose
it
doesnâ€™t
support
more
than
one
version
of
a
give
the
systemâ€™s
answer
be
pattern_2
by
organize
an
component_4
and
it
plug
in
into
multiple
pattern_2
the
require
isolation
between
plug
in
can
be
achieve
with
the
component_1
each
technology_1
component_4
always
contain
at
least
one
pattern_2
the
boot
pattern_2
it
contain
the
component_6
and
the
provide
on
the
path
an
example
the
greeter
cli
component_7
to
make
thing
more
tangible
letâ€™s
consider
a
specific
example
the
greeter
component_7
be
a
little
cli
utility
that
can
produce
greet
in
different
technology_7
in
order
to
not
limit
the
number
of
support
technology_7
it
provide
a
plug
in
technology_8
which
allow
to
additional
greet
implementation
without
the
need
to
rebuild
the
core
component_4
here
be
the
greeter
contract
which
be
to
be
connector_4
by
each
technology_7
plug
in
package
technology_9
example
greeter
technology_8
greeter
{
greet
name
}
greeter
be
instantiate
via
accompany
implementation
of
greeterfactory
greeterfactory
{
getlanguage
getflag
greeter
getgreeter
}
the
getlanguage
and
getflag
be
use
to
show
a
description
of
all
quality_attribute_2
greeter
in
the
cli
component_4
the
getgreeter
a
instance
of
the
correspond
greeter
type
hereâ€™s
the
overall
architecture
of
the
greeter
component_4
with
three
different
technology_7
implementation
the
component_4
be
make
up
of
five
different
pattern_2
greeter
component_6
contain
the
greeter
and
greeterfactory
contract
greeter
en
greeter
de
and
greeter
fr
greeter
implementation
for
different
technology_7
note
how
each
one
be
quality_attribute_3
on
a
different
version
of
some
greeter
date
a
they
be
isolate
in
different
pattern_2
they
can
co
exist
within
the
component_4
greeter
component_7
the
shell
of
the
component_4
which
load
all
the
greeter
implementation
and
make
them
quality_attribute_4
a
a
quality_attribute_5
cli
component_4
now
letâ€™s
see
how
this
component_4
connector_data_2
can
be
assemble
use
layrry
component_4
plug
in
with
layrry
in
a
previous
weâ€™ve
explore
how
component_2
can
be
cut
into
pattern_2
describe
in
layrryâ€™s
pattern_2
yml
configuration
a
quality_attribute_5
pattern_2
definition
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
a
plug
in
architecture
though
not
all
possible
plug
in
be
when
assemble
the
component_4
layrry
connector_5
this
requirement
by
allow
to

whereas
the

all

and
the
component_9
pattern_2
will
be
the
parent
of
each

the

have
all

allow
it
to
connector_6

from
these
pattern_2
more
greeter

can
be

by
simply
create
a

with

with
the
technology_1
component_10
loader
connector_data_2
the
component_4
into
different
pattern_2
isnâ€™t
all
we
need
for
build
a
plug
in
architecture
we
also
need
a
way
for
detecting
and
loading
the
actual
plug
in
implementation
the
component_10
loader
mechanism
of
the
technology_1
component_6
come
in
handy
for
that
if
you
have
never
work
with
the
component_10
loader
technology_8
itâ€™s
definitely
recommend
to
study
it
extensive
javadoc
description
a

at

of
an

choose

be
a
support
feature
of
technology_1
since
version
the
component_10
loader
component_9
have
be
be
rework
and
refine
to
work
within
modular
environment
when
the
technology_1
component_1
be
introduce
in
jdk
in
order
to
connector_6
component_10
implementation
via
the
component_10
loader
a
connector_8
must
declare
the
use
of
the
component_10
in
it
descriptor
for
our
purpose
the
greeterfactory
contract
be
a
perfect
examplification
of
the
component_10
idea
hereâ€™s
the
descriptor
of
the
greeter
applicationâ€™s
component_7
declare
it
usage
of
this
component_10

}
the
descriptor
of
each
greeter
plug

must
declare
the
component_10
implementation
s
which
it
provide
e

here
be
the

}
from
within
the
component_7
the
component_10
implementation
can
be
connector_6
via
the
technology_1
util
serviceloader
when
use
the
component_10
loader
in
pattern_2
component_4
thereâ€™s
one
potential
pitfall
though
which
mostly
will
affect
exist
component_2
which
be
migrate
in
order
to
connector_9
component_10
implementation
locate
in
a
different
pattern_2
specifically
in
an
ancestor
pattern_2
of
the
loading
pattern_2
the
load
modulelayer
must
be
use
when
use
other
overload
variant
of
load
e
g
the
commonly
use
load
those
implementation
wonâ€™t
be
find
hence
the
for
loading
the
greeter
implementation
from
within
the
component_7
pattern_2
could
look
this
private

greeterfactory
getgreeterfactories

}
have
load
the
connector_data_4
of
greeter
factory
it
doesnâ€™t
take
too
much
to
display
a
connector_data_4
with
all
quality_attribute_2
implementation
expect
a
choice
by
the
component_11
and
invoke
the
greeter
for
the
chosen
technology_7
this
which
isnâ€™t
too
interest
be
omit
here
for
the
sake
of
brevity
and
can
be
find
in
the
accompany
example
component_8
repo
jdk
bring
some
more
nice
improvement
for
the
component_10
loader
technology_8
e
g
the
type
of
component_10
implementation
can
be
examine
without
actually
instantiate
them
this
allow
for
interest
alternative
for
provide
component_10
meta
connector_data_6
and
choose
an
implementation
base
on
some
criterion
for
instance
greeter
metadata
the
technology_7
name
and
flag
could
be
give
use
an
annotation
@greeterdefinition
lang=
english
flag=

englishgreeterfactory
connector_7
greeterfactory

then
the
serviceloader

can
be
use
to
obtain
the

and
a

see
it
in
action
lastly
letâ€™s
take
a
look
at
the
complete
greeter
component_4
in
action
here
it
be
initially
with
two
and
then
with
three
greeter
implementation
the
pattern_2
configuration
be
adjust
to
load
greeter
plug
in
from
the
plugins
directory
initially
two
greeter
for
english
and
french
exist
then
the
german
greeter
implementation
connector_13
pick
up
by
the
component_4
after
it
to
the
plug
in
directory
without
require
any
connector_14
to
the
component_4
tiself
the
complete
component_8
include
the
component_12
for
display
all
the
quality_attribute_2
greeter
and
prompt
for
input
be
quality_attribute_2
in
the
layrry
pattern_5
on
technology_11
and
there
you
have
it
a
basic
plug
in
architecture
use
layrry
and
the
technology_1
component_1
go
connector_15
this
might
quality_attribute_7
in
a
few
way
e
g
it
might
be
desirable
to
detect
additional
plug
in
without
have
to
restart
the
component_4
e
g
when
think
of
desktop
component_4
use
requirement_2
while
loading
additional
plug
in
in
pattern_2
should
be
comparatively
easy
unload
already
load
pattern_2
e
g
when
update
a
plug
in
to
a
version
could
potentially
be
quite
tricky
in
particular
thereâ€™s
no
way
to
actively
unload
pattern_2
so
weâ€™d
have
to
rely
on
the
garbage
collector
to
clean
up
unused
pattern_2
make
sure
no
reference
to
any
of
their
be
keep
in
other
active
pattern_2
one
also
could
think
of
an
bus
allow
different
plug
in
to
connector_16
in
a
quality_attribute_8
yet
loosely
couple
way
what
requirement
would
you
have
for
plug
in
center
component_2
run
on
the
technology_1
component_1
