now
if
apply
to

this
be
the
concept
of
a

in
technical
term
a

component_3
allow

requirement_6

quality_attribute_2
for

both
large
and

while
enabling
continuous
test
and
early
delivery
but
before
we
delve
deep
into
the
fundamental
of
pattern_1
design
u
have
a
look
at
it
advantage
advantage
of
pattern_1
architecture
with
monolithic
architecture
developer
often
face
challenge
of
limit
quality_attribute_3
and
quality_attribute_4
but
with
a
pattern_1
design
this
single
unit
can
be
break
down
into
different
make
development
deployment
and
quality_attribute_5
easy
so
s
have
a
look
at
some
major
advantage
of
pattern_1
architecture
technological
quality_attribute_6
while
monolithic
architecture
always
leave
the
developer
look
for
the
right
technology_3
for
the
a
pattern_1
architecture
offer
coexistence
of
multiple
technology_4
under
one
cover
different
decouple
component_4
can
be
connector_3
in
multiple
programming
technology_5
not
only
do
this
enable
developer
to
experiment
but
also
quality_attribute_7
their
technology_6
by
additional
feature
and
requirement_7
increase
quality_attribute_2
pattern_1
architecture
quality_attribute_8
up
the
entire
component_5
of
creation
unlike
a
single
unit
team
can
work
simultaneously
on
multiple
component_6
of
a
component_3
this
in
addition
to
increasing
productivity
make
it
easy
to
locate
specific
component_6
and
focus
on
them
malfunctioning
of
a
single
component_7
will
not
affect
the
entire
component_3
instead
this
also
ea
error
location
and
quality_attribute_5
technology_6
not
project
accord
to
martin
fowler
pattern_1
architecture
help
requirement_8
create
technology_6
instead
of
project
in
quality_attribute_9
term
the
use
of
pattern_1
architecture
allow
team
to
come
together
and
create
requirement_7
for
requirement_8
rather
than
a
quality_attribute_9
the
entire
team
come
together
to
contribute
to
different
requirement_7
these
can
further
be
use
for
different
line
of
requirement_8
if
applicable
in
addition
it
also
create
an
autonomous
cross
functional
team
fundamental
to
a
successful
pattern_1
design
now
we
the
advantage
of
a
pattern_1
architecture
but
how
do
we
achieve
the
perfection
be
we
aware
of
the
pattern_1
design
principle
what
be
the
best
practice
to
design
a
pattern_1
architecture
u
answer
these
question
and
look
at
some
fundamental
to
a
successful
pattern_1
design
the
scope
of
requirement_7
with
the
simultaneous
implementation
of
development
and
deployment
by
different
team
to
establish
or
support
a
respectively
unique
requirement_7
with
a
technology_6
define
the
scope
of
a
pattern_1
become
s
a
very
important
connector_data_1
while
many
people
hold
the
concern
of
create
too
many
tiny
pattern_2
it
be
usually
more
commonly
see
that
these
pattern_2
be
overload
when
we
talk
about
the
scope
of
a
pattern_1
we
be
refer
to
the
feature
of
an
independent
the
ability
of
pattern_2
to
perform
a
a
nearly
stateless
component_3
allow
it
to
be
develop
independently
it
thus
become
imperative
to
identify
requirement_7
that
a
pattern_1
will
connector_4
this
help
to
understand
what
a
pattern_1
be
responsible
for
to
realize
the
intend
requirement_7
that
each
pattern_1
should
serve
not
only
to
prevent
overload
but
to
serve
different
scenario
a
well
for
example
a
piece
of
be
connector_5
multiple
time
in
a
monolithic
setup
create
a
pattern_1
will
make
it
easy
to
connector_6
and
use
minimize
the
amount
of
will
only
improve
quality_attribute_2
and
avoid
bloat
component_8
the
question
come
a
to
how
one
can
go
about
define
the
scope
of
a
pattern_1
though
there
isn
t
a
well
define
set
of
rule
to
achieve
this
there
be
a
few
set
of
guideline
or
best
practice
if
you
define
a
scope
follow
be
some
of
the
step
that
you
can
take
to
define
your
pattern_1
the
first
step
be
to
identify
the
piece
of
that
be
replicate
under
various
how
often
do
you
see
them
repeat
and
how
much
effort
go
into
connector_7
them
setup
each
time
in
different
if
the
answer
to
all
of
these
be
high
then
the
scope
of
the
pattern_1
would
be
to
handle
the
repeat
piece
of
another
step
that
you
can
take
be
to
connector_8
if
a
be
not
dependent
on
other
or
in
quality_attribute_9
term
connector_8
if
it
s
possible
that
a
be
loosely
couple
with
the
rest
of
the
component_8
if
so
then
the
scope
of
the
pattern_1
will
be
the
scope
of
the
entire
another
very
important
metric
to
consider
while
define
the
scope
be
to
connector_8
if
the
feature
would
be
use
with
a
heavy
load
this
would
connector_8
if
the
pattern_1
would
have
to
be
quality_attribute_7
up
in
the
near
future
if
it
do
then
it
s
a
quality_attribute_10
idea
to
define
the
quality_attribute_11
bit
a
the
scope
of
a
pattern_1
rather
than
combine
it
with
other
feature
high
pattern_4
combine
with
loose
couple
the
motive
of
any
pattern_1
be
to
have
component_4
independent
of
each
other
this
mean
one
can
edit
update
or
quality_attribute_12
a
component_8
without
hamper
any
other
component_4
present
this
be
possible
if
interdependence
be
low
a
loosely
couple
component_3
be
the
one
where
one
component_8
too
le
or
nothing
about
others
when
break
down
a
monolithic
architecture
into
small
component_4
or
component_7
it
be
important
to
combine
similar
requirement_7
this
combination
of
relate
component_9
into
a
single
unit
be
pattern_4
the
high
the
pattern_4
the
quality_attribute_10
be
the
pattern_1
architecture
a
low
pattern_4
would
indicate
too
much
connector_9
between
different
component_4
lead
to
a
poor
component_3
requirement_6
unique
component_10
of
identification
follow
the
fundamental
of
pattern_1
design
it
be
important
for
any
component_8
to
be
the
unique
component_10
of
identification
for
the
rest
of
the
component_3
u
take
an
example
to
understand
this
scenario
after
an
order
be
place
on
an
e
commerce
the
component_11
be
provide
with
an
order
this
order
once
generate
contain
all
the
connector_data_2
regard
the
order
a
a
pattern_1
the
order
be
the
only
component_10
for
any
connector_data_2
regard
the
order
component_8
so
if
any
other
component_8
seek
connector_data_2
regard
the
order
component_8
the
order
act
a
the
component_10
of
connector_data_2
rather
than
it
actual
attribute
component_12
requirement_5
break
down
the
monolithic
design
into
multiple
component_4
mean
these
component_8
will
coordinate
and
work
together
to
form
the
component_3
but
how
do
these
component_4
connector_10
imagine
use
multiple
technology_4
to
create
different
component_8
how
do
they
relate
to
each
other
well
the
quality_attribute_9
answer
would
be
the
use
of
an
component_12
component_13
programming
the
fundamental
of
pattern_1
design
be
use
the
correct
technology_7
this
be
crucial
to
maintain
connector_9
between
the
component_8
and
the
component_14
connector_data_3
easy
transition
and
connector_11
be
important
for
proper
another
important
thing
to
note
while
create
an
component_12
be
the
domain
of
the
requirement_8
this
definition
of
the
domain
will
ease
out
the
component_5
of
differentiate
the
requirement_7
there
be
several
component_15
which
be
external
to
the
component_3
these
component_15
could
be
other
component_16
or
component_11
whenever
a
requirement_8
component_9
be
connector_data_3
it
be
handle
by
an
adapter
a
connector_data_4
gateway
or
web
pattern_5
which
the
connector_data_5
and
make
connector_12
to
the
component_1
connector_data_6
storage
segregation
any
connector_data_6
component_17
for
a
specific
component_8
should
be
make
private
to
that
specific
component_8
this
mean
any
connector_6
to
the
connector_data_6
should
be
owned
by
the
component_8
this
connector_data_6
can
be
connector_13
with
any
other
component_8
only
through
an
technology_7
this
be
very
important
to
maintain
limit
connector_6
to
connector_data_6
and
avoid
component_8
couple
classification
of
connector_data_6
base
on
the
component_18
be
important
and
can
be
achieve
through
the
command
and
query
responsibility
segregation
cqrs
traffic
requirement_9
once
the
component_19
have
be
set
and
the
component_3
be
up
and
run
traffic
to
different
component_4
will
vary
the
traffic
be
the
connector_data_7
connector_14
to
specific
component_4
by
the
component_14
in
the
real
world
scenario
a
component_8
run
slowly
thus
cause
connector_data_7
to
take
more
time
or
a
component_8
be
flood
with
connector_data_3
in
both
the
requirement_10
the
requirement_6
will
be
affect
even
cause
a
or
hardware
crash
this
high
traffic
demand
need
requirement_9
a
specific
way
of
connector_15
and
be
connector_5
be
the
answer
to
a
smooth
flow
of
traffic
the
component_4
should
be
able
to
terminate
any
such
instance
which
cause
delay
and
affect
the
requirement_6
this
can
also
be
achieve
use
a
component_5
a
auto
quality_attribute_7
which
include
constant
track
of
component_4
with
prompt
action
whenever
require
in
some
requirement_10
a
circuit
breaker
pattern_6
be
important
to
supply
whatever
incomplete
connector_data_2
be
quality_attribute_13
in
requirement_10
of
a
break
connector_data_3
or
an
unresponsive
component_8
automate
the
component_5
pattern_2
design
independently
should
be
able
to
in
it
own
accord
the
automation
would
enable
self
deployment
and
without
the
need
for
any
intervention
this
component_5
enable
the
component_4
to
be
requirement_4
requirement_11
in
nature
and
the
ability
to
be
quality_attribute_12
in
any
environment
but
to
achieve
this
it
be
very
important
to
have
a
devops
team
constantly
work
towards
the
evolution
of
the
component_8
minimal
component_1
component_20
preferably
isolate
component_21
connector_16
component_1
component_20
to
fetch
connector_data_6
can
be
a
lengthy
component_5
it
can
take
up
time
and
energy
while
design
a
pattern_1
the
motive
should
revolve
around
the
requirement_8
rather
than
the
component_1
and
it
work
to
ensure
this
even
with
connector_data_6
entry
run
into
million
a
pattern_1
design
should
have
only
a
couple
of
component_21
in
addition
to
minimum
number
focus
around
the
requirement_8
be
key
constant
pattern_7
imagine
break
down
a
monolithic
architecture
into
a
pattern_1
design
this
need
a
lot
of
time
and
resource
it
be
not
easy
to
pattern_8
all
the
connector_12
make
with
the
help
of
the
traditional
technology_3
the
insertion
of
connector_data_6
pattern_9
and
pattern_10
increase
requirement_6
but
make
it
difficult
to
pattern_8
the
entire
component_5
hence
for
design
a
pattern_1
architecture
it
be
important
to
establish
a
component_5
for
actively
pattern_7
the
storage
of
the
connector_data_6
in
a
central
location
this
will
help
reflect
the
frequent
connector_12
without
affect
the
requirement_6
of
the
component_3
in
a
common
scenario
the
pattern_1
pattern_7
technology_3
will
pattern_8
individual
component_4
and
late
combine
the
connector_data_6
by
connector_17
it
in
a
centralized
location
this
be
a
necessary
step
while
follow
micro
component_8
design
principle
realize
the
crucial
part
play
by
an
component_12
in
a
successful
pattern_1
architecture
one
must
also
have
a
component_5
to
constantly
pattern_8
the
component_12
requirement_6
component_12
requirement_6
pattern_7
be
crucial
to
any
pattern_1
architecture
in
order
to
make
sure
the
requirement_7
stay
up
to
the
mark
in
term
of
quality_attribute_8
quality_attribute_14
and
overall
requirement_6
of
the
technology_6
limitation
of
pattern_1
architecture
while
pattern_2
be
the
best
way
to
tone
down
a
monolithic
connector_data_8
it
come
with
it
own
set
of
drawback
but
before
connector_7
to
any
conclusion
s
have
a
look
at
some
of
these
development
environment
overload
with
the
growth
of
the
component_13
and
it
component_1
there
be
an
expansion
in
the
base
a
well
with
the
expand
for
every
pattern_1
present
it
overload
the
development
environment
with
every
component_13
that
be
load
this
can
cause
a
major
delay
in
productivity
devops
complexity
development
and
deployment
of
single
pattern_2
be
not
an
easy
connector_data_1
use
of
multiple
technology_4
and
create
component_19
to
centralize
the
component_3
be
a
challenge
this
connector_data_7
for
an
experience
devops
team
procure
such
an
experience
devops
team
be
very
crucial
to
maintain
the
complexity
of
a
pattern_1
base
component_13
increase
in
resource
and
requirement_12
usage
with
multiple
component_6
work
together
it
be
important
for
them
to
connector_10
with
each
other
at
some
level
this
connector_9
will
lead
to
an
increase
requirement_12
usage
this
demand
a
high
quality_attribute_8
quality_attribute_15
requirement_12
connector_18
in
addition
expense
increase
to
run
these
component_13
all
component_4
run
individually
mount
up
the
cost
of
test
test
the
component_13
can
be
challenge
since
there
be
individual
component_7
compare
to
a
monolithic
component_13
pattern_2
take
long
to
test
and
be
more
complex
in
requirement_10
of
any
error
at

can
be
cause
due
to

which
eventually
affect
the

quality_attribute_1
quality_attribute_1
be
of
paramount
importance
when
it
come
to
web
component_13
with
pattern_2
achieve
this
be
difficult
when
there
be
cluster
of
independent
each
need
to
adhere
to
the
pattern_11
and
pattern_12
norm
define
for
the
entire
component_3
apart
from
that
each
might
talk
to
other
and
track
the
flow
of
connector_data_6
become
very
difficult
additional
measure
such
a
component_12
gateway
with
load
balance
be
require
to
ensure
the
behaviour
be
consistent
these
additional
step
cause
overhead
on
each
of
the
pattern_1
component_13
complexity
a
pattern_2
be
independent
component_7
very
often
each
pattern_1
will
have
a
technology_4
technology_8
that
best
suit
it
need
for
example
a
requirement_13
might
use
the
technology_9
technology_8
while
the
meter
component_8
might
use
the
technology_1
technology_8
and
the
ui
component_8
might
use
the
mean
technology_8
this
lead
to
complexity
a
the
resource
pool
and
the
skill
require
to
manage
and
build
feature
will
be
very
high
high
initial
investment
pattern_2
run
independently
and
they
require
independent
container
or
resource
to
run
them
each
project
might
have
a
lot
of
pattern_2
work
together
and
it
would
require
a
much
high
investment
to
set
up
all
the
cluster
that
include
the
pattern_2
the
quality_attribute_1
container
load

component_12
gateway
etc
be
it
worth
it
after
have
connector_19
the
fundamental
of
pattern_1
design
it
be
clear
that
there
be
a
certain
set
of
best
practice
which
need
to
be
follow
but
we
also
observe
how
the
pattern_1
design
principle
ease
the
component_5
of
create
an
component_13
by
break
down
the
monolithic
architecture
but
at
the
same
time
there
be
certain
challenge
which
need
to
be
overcome
when
adapt
a
pattern_1
architecture
these
complexity
affect
the
operational
component_22
but
in
the
long
term
overcome
these
challenge
can
lead
to
an
optimize
and
more
quality_attribute_16
component_13
in
addition
it
overcome
the
delay
and
flaw
