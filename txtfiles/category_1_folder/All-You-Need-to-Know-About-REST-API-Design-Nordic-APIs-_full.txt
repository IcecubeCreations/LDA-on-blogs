if
you
study
or
create
component_2
in
any
way
you’ve
almost
undoubtedly
come
across
the
term
rest
restful
or
rest

we
often
reference
pattern_1
a
a
best
practice
for
connector_1
apis
but
what
exactly
be
representational
state
transfer
and
what’s
the
difference
between
a
pattern_1
and
rest

technology_1
the
principle
of
pattern_1
be
lay
out
by
roy

in
his

dissertation

loosely
define
pattern_1
a
a
mean
for
component_4
and
component_5
to
exchange
connector_data_1
one
key
component_6
of
pattern_1
architecture
be
that
the
end
component_7
doesn’t
have
to
anything
about
the
component_8
ahead
of
time
to
use
it
rest’s
architectural
elementsfielding
doesn’t
mention
technology_2
or
specification
instead
he
define
pattern_1
a
meet
certain
specific
architectural
element
and
constraint
component_9
component_10
pattern_1
component_11
must
contain
a
component_10
that
manage
component_8
connector_data_1
and
define
it
state
the
component_10
connector_2
with
a
component_9
that
with
component_7
connector_3
each
of
these
component_12
be
independent
and
can
be
modify
independently
stateless
pattern_1
component_11
must
be
stateless
all
of
the
state
connector_data_1
be
manage
from
the
component_9
side
a
connector_data_2
from
the
component_8
contain
all
of
the
connector_data_3
necessary
for
their
component_13
cacheable
pattern_1
component_5
mark
their
connector_data_1
a
cacheable
or
not
this

component_4
and
infrastructure
decide
if
they
want
to
pattern_2
connector_data_3
or
not
to
improve
requirement_1
it
also
enable
them
to
dispose
of
non
cacheable
connector_data_3
so
the
connector_data_1
they
connector_4
be
guarantee
to
be
fresh
and
relevant
uniform

have
a
uniform
be
rest’s
most
define
characteristic

state
“the
central
feature
that
distinguish
the
pattern_1
architectural
style
from
other
requirement_2
base
style
be
it
emphasis
on
a
uniform
between
component_6
”layered
component_14
component_12
of
a
pattern_1
component_14
cannot
see
beyond
their
pattern_3
this
make
it
easy
to
additional
level
of
quality_attribute_1
and
pattern_4
for
enhance
requirement_1
how
to
connector_5
restrest
be
mostly
concern
with
the
uniform
presentation
of
connector_data_1
a
a
resource
one
of
the
cornerstone
of
the
“rest
vs
restful”
debate
be
look
only
at
uri
or
technology_3
command
that’s
not
the
entire
picture
however
to
illustrate
consider
a
web
component_15
for
modify
an
ecommerce
component_16
use
connector_6

and
delete
command
one
version
of
this
component_8
might
have
a
single
url
that
handle
all
of
the
connector_6
and
command
a
component_7
can
amend
the
component_16
by

a
document
state
the
require
connector_7
one
could
a
item
to
the
component_16
use
a
‘newitem’
command

inventory
technology_3


{
newitem
{
name

item
requirement_3




}
}
or
they
could
query
the
component_16
use
an
‘itemrequest’
connector_data_4

inventory
technology_3


{
itemrequest
{


}
}finally
you
could
connector_7
or
delete
connector_data_5
use
‘itemdelete’
or
‘itemupdate’

inventory
technology_3


{
itemdelete
{


}
}none
of
these
approach
meet
the
requirement
for
rest
they’re
connector_8
use
argument
for
resource
that
happen
to
be
component_17
in
a
technology_4
document
use
technology_3
connector_data_2
a
pattern_5
component_15
would
have
a
uri
for
every
item
in
the
inventory

an
item
would
look
something
this

item
technology_3


{
item
{
name

item
requirement_3




}
}
that’s
where
the
similarity
end
however
connector_6

and
delete
command
would
all
look
very
different
for
instance
connector_9
an
item
would
always
require
a
connector_6
command
connector_6
item

technology_3


delete
a
would
look

delete
item

technology_3


connector_data_5
can
be
modify
use
put
command
put
inventory
technology_3


{
item
{
name

item
requirement_3




}
}
pattern_1
work
with
specific
technology_3
action
which
correspond
to
specific
uris
there’s
another
reason
this
distinction
be
essential
a
well
rest
restful
and
the
richardson
maturity
indexwhen
specific
resource
fuel
uris
you
make
an
component_1
quality_attribute_2
developer
and
component_18
be
almost
able
to
visualize
your
component_1
even
if
they
don’t
what
it
do
even
if
an
component_1
isn’t
entirely
quality_attribute_2
it
can
still
be
document
use
hypertext
this
make
it
so
that
every
item

by
an
component_1
would
have
connector_10
for
delete
update
or
specify
the
quality_attribute_1
level
of
a
resource
in
the
inventory
for
example
let’s
start
by
look
at
some
without
resource
here’s
a
little
bit
of
quality_attribute_3
sample
for
schedule
a
doctor’s
appointment
only
use
technology_3
and
a
remote
connector_3

usually
base
on
the
remote
invocation

appointmentservice
technology_3


various
other

this

an
answer
from
the
component_16
show
quality_attribute_4
open
slot
at
an
specify
by
a
uri
the
component_10
would
something
this
technology_3



ok
various

the
next
step
would
be
to
book
an
appointment
use
a
similar


appointmentservice
technology_3


various
other

if
everything
be
work
a
it
should
you’d
see
a
connector_11
this

to
the
component_1

technology_3



ok
various

so
far
this
be
a
technology_5
remote
connector_data_4
component_14
a
your
be
simply
move
connector_data_6
back
and
forth
now
let’s
take
a
look
at
what
happen
when
we
resource
which
connector_12
connector_data_7
to
particular
rather
than
one
universal
uri

doctor
mjones
technology_3


various
other

this

the
same
essential
connector_data_3
but
make
each
slot
a
resource
that
can
be
explicitly
connector_13
technology_3



ok
various

use
specific
resource
mean

connector_14
to
a
particular
slot

slot

technology_3


various
other

if
everything
be
a
it
should
be
you
should
connector_6
a
similar
connector_11
a
above
technology_3



ok
various

this
mean
that
if
the
component_1
caller
need
to
connector_15
their
appointment
for
any
reason
they
have
a
dedicate
place
to
do
so
unfortunately
many
sit
don’t
meet
these
requirement
yet
they’re
still
refer
to
a
rest
this
prompt
leonard
richardson
to
create
a
component_19
for

of

to

fielding’s

mean
that
only
level

component_11
qualify
a

that
mean
that
many
component_11
we
consider
pattern_1
actually
aren’t
hardly
anything
us
a
purely
pattern_1
approach
technically
speak
pattern_1
only
concern
itself
with
resource
which
be
connector_16
to
unique
uris
resource
be
never
bundle
under
rest
that
doesn’t
mean
it’s
not
possible
however
the
world_wide_web
itself
be
one
example
of
an
actual
pattern_1
component_8
it
involve
a
component_9
and
a
component_10
for
one
thing
it’s
stateless
for
another
a
a
web
browser
doesn’t
need
to
what
it’s

let’s
take
a
look
at
a
proper
pattern_1
component_8
to
help
you
connector_6
an
idea
of
what
separate
representational
state
transfer
component_2
from
the
rest
instagram’s
component_1
be
compliant
with
rest
let’s
start
by
look
at
a
connector_data_9
of
all
of
the
different

for
connector_17
with
a
component_7
account

you

and
even

this

can
then
be

to

give
you
an

how
instagram’s

connector_data_1
about
the

via
the
technology_1
it
also
should
give
you
an
illustration
of
how
those

can
be

to
various
component_1

most
component_11
use
some
of
rest’s
principle
but
don’t
adhere
to
fielding’s
strict
specification
this
make
them
more
rest

than
pattern_1
proper
rest
vs
rest
likeas
you
can
see
from
the
specification
above
not
a
lot
of
resource
qualify
a
purely

that’s
okay
a
pattern_1
be
more
of
a
philosophy
or
an
architectural
style
than
a
concrete
technology_2
pure
pattern_1
be
often
too
difficult
to
connector_5
to
be
pragmatic
for
a
lot
of
project
component_4
spend
too
much
time
energy
and
resource
define
custom

type
it’s
a
lot
of
work
to
connector_6
every
individual

point
to
conform
to
the
particular
architectural
constraint
of

a
a

that

orient
component_15
a

it’s
a

and
so
do
definition
the
tendency
to
split
hair
over
whether
an

pattern_1
or
not
show
that
you’re
think
more
a
developer
than
an

component_7
which
be
a
mistake
an
component_1
component_20
could
likely
care

if

vision
they’re
the
one
you
need
to
worry
about
if
you

your

we’ve

lay

obviously
the

have

we

we

many
