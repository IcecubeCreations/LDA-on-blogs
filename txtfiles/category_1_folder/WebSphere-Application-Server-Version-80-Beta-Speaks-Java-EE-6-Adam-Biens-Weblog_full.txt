i
would
agree
with
rohit
s
that
it
be
a
misconception
that
be
be
bloat
i
adam
s
be
make
in
jest
but
certainly
doesn
t
help
the
misconception
i
would
also
point
out
that
technology_1


introduce
a
feature
that
would
provision
only
the
component_8
that
be
require
for
component_9
quality_attribute_2
to
a
component_2
although
the
set
be
disable
by
default
you
can
enable
it
and
reduce
the
footprint
of
run
unneeded
component_10
i
believe
this
be
a
fairly
unique
feature
not
provide
by
any
other
component_2
so
you
can
connector_2
the
lightweight
component_2
you
want
if
you
only
quality_attribute_2
war
but
still
have
a
fully
technology_2
ee
compliant
component_2
for
component_9
that
need
it
