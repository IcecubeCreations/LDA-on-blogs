a
requirement_1
come
in
a
variety
of
shape
and
size
if
you‚Äôre
look
to
use
one
in
your

it‚Äôs
important
to
understand
requirement_1
architecture
to
see
how
different
component_2
fit
together
that
way
you
will
be
able
to
build
a

and
successful
requirement_3

how
do

work
and
what
do
the
typical
requirement_1
architecture
look

in
a
quality_attribute_2
summary
chatbots
be
usually
make
up
of
a
combination
of
component_4
and

usually
a
pattern_1
component_3
a
natural
technology_1
component_5
nlp
component_6
and
a
component_7
the
component_8
connector_2
a
connector_data_2
which
be
connector_3
to
the
nlu
component_6
which
us

to

the
word
use
in

and
identify
the

full
of
candidate
connector_5
and
pick
the
one
that
best
fit
the
user‚Äôs

this
be
the
most
basic
component_5
of
one
type
of
requirement_1
of
which
there
be
many
and
you

you

use
connector_data_2

be

a

extremely

a
they

many

secondly
connector_8
all
these
component_4
to

look

if
you

you‚Äôll

technology_8
and

to
enable
complex

on

this
requirement_2
requirement
for
connector_data_5
quality_attribute_8
and
the
whole
component_19
quickly

and
convolute
below
be
an
example
of
a
requirement_3
build
entirely
with
the
technology_9
requirement_15
build
your
whole
requirement_1
on

component_3
have
it

con
it
be
something
that
will
entirely
quality_attribute_9
on
your

so
you‚Äôre
not
here
all

i‚Äôll
cover
two
important

and
leave
the
rest
for
you
stare
at
for
your

‚Äúamusement‚Äù
quality_attribute_8
&
governance
quality_attribute_8
governance
and
connector_data_5
protection
should
always
be
a
high
priority
even
for
small
requirement_10
however
it‚Äôs
particularly
important
to
requirement_2
where
they
can
have
datastores
on
million
of
people
detail
in
some
situation
highly
confidential
and
personal
it‚Äôs
here
where
we
need
a
pattern_7
of
quality_attribute_8
governance
to
connector_13
that
the
component_8
need
to
stay
anonymous
then
any
reveal
detail
connector_7
pattern_8
outwants
to
connector_14
personal
connector_data_4
it‚Äôs
do
so
securely
be
try
to
hack
or
connector_14
sensitive
component_18
without
authority
they‚Äôre
stop
immediately
quality
assurance
requirement_2
have
another
challenge
small
mistake
can
create
massive
ripple
for
example
when
your
requirement_1
have


component_20
month
you
really
don‚Äôt
want
all
of
them
to
see
those
typo
or
hyperlink
you
connector_7
the
idea
any
connector_15
you
make
need
to
be
test
with
multiple
pattern_7
and
people
involve
it‚Äôs
why
the
swiss
cheese
component_21
be
so
quality_attribute_4
this
one
of
the
reason
we
build
ebm
because
all
the
current
requirement_7
component_4
luis
&
watson
don‚Äôt
have
quality_attribute_2
way
of
make
amendment
without
quality_attribute_10
to
a
live
environment
natural
technology_1
generation
requirement_3
lastly
we
have
end
to
end
requirement_9
chatbots
this
be
where
we
use
requirement_9
to
create
component_22
base
on
historical
conversation
requirement_13
that
aim
to
generate
connector_5
connector_data_6
from
scratch
rather
than
via
intent
detection
and
look
up
the
relevant
connector_5
in
a
component_7
these
be
usually
single
instance
where
a
bunch
of
connector_data_5
be
turn
into
‚Äúcomputer
speak‚Äù
pre
component_5
sort
and
organise
feature
engineering
and
then
train
to
see
if
the
answer
it
generate
be
similar
to
those
in
the
real
human
transcription
these
type
of
requirement_3
aren‚Äôt
often
use
in
requirement_16
and
large
quality_attribute_11
component_23
yet
a
frankly
they
don‚Äôt
perform
a
well
vs

and
flow
base
chatbots
the
one

what

your

then
it

the
great

about

if

if
