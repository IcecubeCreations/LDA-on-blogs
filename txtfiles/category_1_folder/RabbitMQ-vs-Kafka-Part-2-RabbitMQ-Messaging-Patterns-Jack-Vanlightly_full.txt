there
be
some
issue

that

if

only

then
you
might
connector_11
unlucky
and
all
go
to
a
single

if
you
have
relatively

then
distribution
be
uneven
if
you
do
not
configure
the

take
that
into

basically
kick

there

to

if

when

the

likewise

one

around
this

be

all

so
if
we
set

or
a
a
connector_data_1
coding_keyword_1
we
can
guarantee
that
all
the
connector_data_2
of
a
give
book
coding_keyword_7
always
go
to
the
same
component_6
then
if
we
only
have
a
single
component_3
connector_5
from
that
component_6
we
connector_11
the
component_9
order
guarantee
we
need
pattern_4
fullsize
fig

connector_data_2

by

each
component_6
connector_12
by

component_3
but
technology_1
doesn
t
help
you
coordinate
your
component_14
to
match

component_3

one
component_6
that
be
down
to
you
to
do
somehow

localityby
use
the
consistent
hash
exchange
in
the
previous
pattern_2
we
also
connector_11
connector_data_3
locality
for
example
all
of
component_23

s
always
go
to
component_3

because
we
hash
a
connector_data_1
coding_keyword_1
that
contain
the
component_23
coding_keyword_7
this
mean
that
component_3

can
do
some
that
would
not
be
feasible
if
requirement_10
round
trip
be
need
we
can
connector_20
counter
real
time
aggregation
and
the
such
in

however
while
this
sound
great
there
be
danger
involve
if
you
increase
the
number
of
component_2
then
the
distribution
of
connector_data_2

so
now
component_23

s
connector_data_2
go
to

but
component_3

doesn

that
it
stop

so
now
you
have
two
component_14
with

you
can
avoid
this
by

roll
some
way
of

this

with
the
twist
that
if
you

the

that

we

this
place
a

if

you

these

which

suffer

s
first
understand
those

so
that
we
can
appreciate
the

provide
by

feel
free
to
skip
to
the
end
of
this
pattern_2
to
pattern_4
technology_1
s
nice
feature
for
pattern_13
an
important
question
be
do
you
want
to
make
the
connector_data_9
in
any
other
invocation
if
the
answer
be
yes
then
you
need
an
pattern_13
architecture
that
be
quality_attribute_14
with
a
stateful
component_25
that
be
there
be
state
in
an
active
component_26
on
a
particular
component_8
that
need
the
connector_35
connector_data_1
to
connector_11
back
to
it
if
we
have
a
quality_attribute_1
out
component_21
of

with
hundred
of
component_27
per

we
need
that
the
connector_35
connector_data_1
connector_30
connector_15
back
to
that
same
component_26
on
that
same
component_8
this
rule
out
some
pattern_2
however
if
we
have
a
stateless
component_25
then
we
be
free
to
choose
any
of
the
pattern_13
pattern_2
if
upon
make
the
pattern_13
connector_data_9
the
component_25
of
that
connector_36
end
and
all
state
be
either
lose
or
pattern_14
with
a
correlation
coding_keyword_7
in

or
something
then
we
have
more
freedom

be
not

if

put

obviously
we
lose

because
we
cannot
use

mirror
to
replicate
the

but
with

we

t
really
need
that
also
if
the

connector_30
disconnect
then
the
pseudo

go
away
and
no
connector_35
can
be

but
that
be
no
different
than
pattern_13
over
technology_20
basically
with

if

go

you
retry
