after

an

}
the
annotation
use
here
be
@jsonbproperty
–
which
be
use
for
specify
a
custom
name
@jsonbtransient
–
when
we
want
to
ignore

when
we

serialization
and
deserialization
first
of
all
to
obtain
the
technology_1
representation
of
our
connector_data_2
we
need
to
use
the
jsonbbuilder
and
it
tojson

to
start

s
create
a
quality_attribute_2
person
connector_data_2
this
person
person
=
person

jhon

protect

localdate
of



bigdecimal
valueof

and
instantiate
the
jsonb

jsonb
jsonb
=
jsonbbuilder
create
then
we
use
the
tojson

jsonperson
=
jsonb
tojson
person
to
obtain
the
follow
technology_1
representation
{


protect


person
name
jhon
registereddate



salary


}
if
we
want
to
do
the
conversion
the
other
way
we
can
use
the
fromjson

person
person
=
jsonb
fromjson
jsonperson
person

naturally
we
can
also
component_3
collection
connector_data_3
person
personlist
=

aslist
jsonarrayperson
=
jsonb
tojson
personlist
to
obtain
the
follow
technology_1
representation
{


protect


person
name
jhon
registereddate



salary


}
{


protect


person
name
jhon
registereddate



salary


}
to
convert
from
technology_1
to
connector_data_3
we
ll
use
the
fromjson
technology_13
connector_data_3
person
personlist
=
jsonb
fromjson
personjsonarray
arraylist
person
{}
getclass
getgenericsuperclass


custom
connector_data_4
with
jsonbconfig
the
jsonbconfig
allow
u
to
customize
the
connector_data_4
component_3
for
all

for
example
we
can
connector_4
the
default
name
strategy
or
the
property
order
now
we’ll
use
the
lower_case_with_underscores
strategy
jsonbconfig
config
=
jsonbconfig
withpropertynamingstrategy
propertynamingstrategy
lower_case_with_underscores
jsonb
jsonb
=
jsonbbuilder
create
config
jsonperson
=
jsonb
tojson
person
to
obtain
the
follow
technology_1
representation
{


protect


person
name
jhon
registered_date



salary


}
now
we’ll
connector_4
the
property
order
with
the
reverse
strategy
use
this
strategy
the
order
of
property
be
in
reverse
order
to
lexicographical
order
this
can
also
be
configure
at
compile
time
with
the
annotation
@jsonbpropertyorder
let’s
see
it
in
action
jsonbconfig
config
=
jsonbconfig
withpropertyorderstrategy
propertyorderstrategy
reverse
jsonb
jsonb
=
jsonbbuilder
create
config
jsonperson
=
jsonb
tojson
person
to
obtain
the
follow
technology_1
representation
{
salary


registereddate



person
name
jhon




protect
}


custom
connector_data_4
with
adapter
when
the
annotation
and
the
jsonbconfig
aren’t
enough
for
u
we
can
use
adapter
to
use
them
we’ll
need
to
connector_5
the
jsonbadapter

which
define
the
follow

adapttojson
–
with
this

we
can
use
custom
conversion
component_4
for
the
serialization
component_3
adaptfromjson
–
this
allow
u
to
use
custom
conversion
component_4
for
the
deserialization
component_3
let’s
create
a
personadapter
to
component_3
the
and
name
attribute
of
the
person

personadapter
connector_6
jsonbadapter
person

{
@override
adapttojson
person
p
throw
exception
{
technology_10
createobjectbuilder


p
getid

name
p
getname
build
}
@override
person
adaptfromjson

adapt
throw
exception
{
person
person
=
person
person
setid
adapt
getint

person
setname
adapt
getstring
name
person
}
}
furthermore
we’ll
assign
the
adapter
to
our
jsonbconfig
instance
jsonbconfig
config
=
jsonbconfig
withadapters

personadapter
jsonb
jsonb
=
jsonbbuilder
create
config
and
we’ll
connector_1
the
follow
technology_1
representation
{


name
jhon
}
