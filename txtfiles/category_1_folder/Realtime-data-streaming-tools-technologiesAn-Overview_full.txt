solve

samza
technology_18
samza
be
another
quality_attribute_3
connector_7
component_9
technology_19
which
be
tightly
tie
to
the
technology_18
technology_33
pattern_3
component_13
samza
be
design
specifically
to
take
advantage
of
kafka’s
unique
architecture
and
guarantee
fault
tolerance
buffer
and
state
storage
samza
us
technology_32
for
resource
negotiation
this
mean
that
by
default
a
technology_10
cluster
be
require
and
samza
rely
on
rich
feature
build
into
technology_32
samza
be
able
to
component_20
state
by
use
a
fault
tolerant
checkpointing
component_13
which
be
connector_13
a
a
local
key
requirement_9
component_20
therefore
this
help
samza
to
offer
at
least
one
delivery
guarantee
though
it
do
not
offer
quality_attribute_11
and
quality_attribute_12
of
recovery
of
the
aggregate
state
in
the
of
failure
it
also
offer
high
level
abstraction
which
in
many
way
be
easy
to
work
with
than
primitive
option
provide
by
component_21
storm
samza
only
support
technology_36
technology_27
which
do
not
have
the
same
technology_27
quality_attribute_13
a
storm
highlight
quality_attribute_14
technology_20
samza
provide
a
very
quality_attribute_14
pattern_4
base
“process
message”
component_11
a
compare
to
mapreduce
manage
state
samza
manage
snapshotting
and
restoration
of
connector_7
processor’s
state
fault
tolerance
samza
work
with
technology_32
whenever
a
component_17
in
the
cluster
fail
in
order
to
transparently
migrate
your
connector_data_6
to
another
component_17
quality_attribute_15
samza
be
component_19
and
quality_attribute_3
at
all
level

technology_33
technology_33
be
a
quality_attribute_3
pattern_5
pattern_3
component_13
which
quality_attribute_6
component_22
connector_data_1
connector_7
it
be
originally
develop
at
linkedin
corporation
and
late
become
a
part
of
technology_18
project
therefore
technology_18
technology_25
be
fast
quality_attribute_7
and
quality_attribute_9
pattern_3
component_13
which
be
the
key
component_23
in
technology_10
technology_2
technology_5
for
support
real

connector_data_1
requirement_5
or
monetization
of
internet
of

iot
connector_data_1
technology_33
can
handle
many
terabyte
of
connector_data_1
without
incur
much
at
all
technology_18
technology_33
be
altogether
different
from
the
traditional
pattern_3
component_13
it
be
design
a
a
quality_attribute_3
component_13
and
which
be
very
easy
to
quality_attribute_16
out
technology_33
be
design
to
connector_2
three
advantage
over
technology_37
technology_38
etc
highlight
highly
quality_attribute_9
technology_33
replicate
connector_data_1
and
it
can
support
multiple
pattern_6
in
the
of
failure
it
automatically
balance
component_24
in
the
of
failure
which
be
very
much
quality_attribute_9
in
comparison
to
similar
pattern_3
component_4
superbly
quality_attribute_7
technology_33
which
be
a
quality_attribute_3
component_13
be
able
to
quality_attribute_16
quickly
and
easily
without
incur
any
downtime
high
requirement_16
for
both
publish
and
subscribe
technology_33
connector_14
high
quality_attribute_17
it
be
capable
of
offer
constant
level
of
requirement_16
even
when
it
deal
with
many
terabyte
of
component_20
connector_data_7
quality_attribute_18
technology_33
provide
intra
cluster
pattern_7
by
keep
connector_data_4
on
the
disk
which
make
it
quality_attribute_18
pattern_3
component_13
conclusion
we
have
plenty
of
option
for
component_9
within
a
requirement_6
component_13
for
connector_7
only
workload
technology_26
have
wide
technology_27
support
and
therefore
can
connector_2
very
low
quality_attribute_8
component_9
technology_33
and
kinesis
be
catch
up
fast
and
provide
their
own
set
of
benefit
for
pattern_2
only
workload
which
be
not
time
sensitive
technology_10
mapreduce
be
a
great
choice
for
mix
kind
of
workload
technology_25
offer
high
quality_attribute_19
pattern_2
component_9
and
micro
pattern_2
component_9
for
connector_7
flink
be
also
become
popular
and
be
position
a
an
alternative
