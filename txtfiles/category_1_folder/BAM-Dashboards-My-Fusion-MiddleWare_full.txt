i
shall
now
turn
to
the
last
part
in
the
development
cycle
of
a
bam
project
the
part
where
it
for
the
end
component_1
be
all
about
the
requirement_1
a
usual
first
a
brief
explanation
from
the
technology_2
documentation
a
requirement_2
pattern_1
be
a
visual
representation
of
connector_data_1
fetch
by
a
requirement_2
query
or
one
or
more
key
requirement_3
indicator
kpis
a
requirement_1
be
a
collection
of
relate
requirement_2
pattern_1
to
display
connector_data_1
to
component_1
a
pattern_1
must
be
include
in
a
requirement_1
requirement_1
can
display
point
in
time
or
real
time
connector_data_2
active
connector_data_1
a
tabbed
requirement_1
contain
other
complete
requirement_1
which
you
pattern_1
by
click
the
tab
in
my
example
project
i
create
a
tabbed
requirement_1
contain
two
requirement_1
the
rest
of
the
will
be
an
explanation
of
the
various
component_2
pattern_1
in
the
requirement_1
requirement_1
operational
requirement_4
part


organizational
connector_data_3
this
concern
a
tree
component_3
there
can
be
click
through
on
the
pattern_1
define
hierarchical
level
on
the
low
level
we
find
the
individual
requirement_5
we
can
see
how
many
open
connector_data_3
per
requirement_5
there
be
and
how
long
on
average
a
connector_data_4
be
open
however
it
be
not
possible
to
connector_1
to
a
detail
pattern_1
of
the
open
connector_data_4
this
would
be
a
welcome
addition
without
this
it
do
not
completely
fulfil
requirement

see
bam
project
requirement
i
have
also

an
action
connector_data_5
to
see
what
it
exactly
be
indicate
that
the
specify
connector_data_5
be
show
in
a
popup
so
this
could
for
example
be
use
a
a
general
explanation
description
of
the
pattern_1

open
connector_data_3
alert
next
the
gauge
a
state
in
the
bam
pattern_1
i
be
especially
interest
in
be
whether
it
be
possible
to
adjust
the
pattern_1
on
runtime
on
design
time
be
in
any
requirement_6
possible
e
g
switch
to
an
arrow
presentation
unfortunately
that
be
not
possible
requirement

this
would
be
a
useful
addition
so
that
each
component_1
can
determine
the
most
pleasant
pattern_1
the
gauge
make
risk
visually
insightful
so
it
fulfil
requirement


today’s
summary
&
yesterday’s
summary
these
pattern_1
both
summary
connector_data_3
and
have
the
possibility
to
drill
through
to
the
specific
connector_data_3
requirement

and


urgency
the
current
presentation
be
very
much
that
of
today’s
summary
&
yesterday’s
summary
but
now
i
use
a
pivot
component_4
a
pivot
component_4
combine
row
and
column
to
display
a
multi
dimensional
pattern_1
of
aggregate
connector_data_1
requirement_7
a
pivot
component_4
be
summarize
vertically
and
horizontally
for
column
and
row
it
display
connector_data_1
from
a
group
technology_3
query
with
one
or
more
aggregation
type
one
or
more
measure
and
two
or
more
dimension
because
i
have
use
only
one
aggregation
type
the
use
of
pivot
component_4
do
not
much
you
can
sort
and
connector_2
the
size
of
the
cell
the
urgency
be
determine
use
a
parameter
‘urgency‘
this
parameter
be
define
by
the
connector_data_1
connector_data_6
bam
parameter
the
pivot
component_4
be
useful
if
multiple
category
be
use
so
if
i
for
example
would
have

the
department
and
team
back
to
the
requirement
do
this
requirement_8
meet
any
of
them
it
do
not
fulfil
requirement

but
it
do
fulfil
requirement

and

requirement_1
operational
requirement_4
part


open
and
close
connector_data_3
the
open
and
close
connector_data_3
line
requirement_8
i
have

this
requirement_8
with
the
intention
to
meet
the
requirement




and

connector_3
requirement

be
not
meet
it’s
not
possible
to
connector_2
the
pattern_1
type
on
runtime
requirement

be
meet
partially
it
be
possible
to
click
through
to
the
detail
but
not
through
the
hierarchy
this
be
present
in
a
treemap
requirement


and

be
meet
via
an
action
the
technology_2
can
be
open
and
connector_data_1
be
pattern_2
dynamic
by
use
parameter

#
day
open
connector_data_7
this
diagram
i
the
most
from
all
i
make
at
the
calculate
be
define
under
what
condition
which
icon
be
show
a
duration
icon
each
line
have
a
connector_3
with
which
it
will
be
possible
to
open
the
associate
connector_data_4
screen
in
this
way
it
be
possible
from
a
central
requirement_1
in
bam
to
handle
humantask
instead
of
use
a
worklist
component_5
dynamic
icon
and
click
through
to
the
humantask
this
meet
requirement

and

and
because
this
diagram
also
support
active
connector_data_1
it
also
fulfil
requirement


organizational
part
for
the
presentation
of
the
jurisdictional
organization
i
have
chosen
a
pie
requirement_8
the
display
of
the
connector_data_1
in
this
requirement_8
be
also
pattern_2
by
use
a
requirement_1
parameter

in
the
urgency
diagram
this
mean
that
it
be
possible
to
select
a
requirement_7
the
same
way
a
it
happen
with
urgency
but
it
be
now
also
possible
to
make
a
selection
by
select
a
slice
of
the
cake
by
right
click
a
slide
and
select
the
right
option
it
be
also
possible
to
pattern_1
the
detail
of
the
selected
requirement_6
this
requirement_8
fulfil
the
requirement


and

unfortunately
it
do
not
support
requirement


logo
i
have

this
component_4
pattern_1
to
determine
whether
it
be
possible
to
dynamically
show
different
image
use
a
requirement_1
parameter
i
have
manage
to
do
this
connector_data_8
however
be
not
quite
a
hop
for
example
i
do
not
succeed
to
hide
the
column
and
i
also
didn’t
manage
to
freeze
the
column
width
the
requirement


and

be
meet
by
this
requirement_8

watchlist
connector_data_3
and
finally
the
kpi
watch
connector_data_7
this
do
not
contain
any
parameter
so
the
pattern_1
be
quite

risk
be
portray
but
in
this
requirement_6
it
be
about
all
the
requirement_6
it
be
not
possible
to
pattern_2
by

parameter
it
will
be
possible
when
this
be
do
the
requirement

and

be
meet
risk
be
make
visible
requirement

and
an
action
be
connector_3
a
component_6
be
connector_4
in
the
alert
dataobject
when
the
number
of
open
connector_data_4
be
above
