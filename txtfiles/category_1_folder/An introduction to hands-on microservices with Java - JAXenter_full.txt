we
all
need
to
how
to
use
them
in
this
alexsandro
souza
introduce
a
number
of
pattern_1
relate
concept
for
leave
the
monolith
behind
a
well
a
start
a
walk
through
on
how
to
create
a
todo
component_1
“microservices
architecture”
be
now
a
popular
concept
in
programming
in
order
to
keep
up
to
date
a
a
developer
i’ve
be
try
to
connector_1
a
quality_attribute_1
understand
of
this
architecture
specifically
i’ve
be
look
at
a
quality_attribute_1
way
to
connector_2
pattern_1
architecture
in
technology_1
use
technology_4
some
background
my
requirement_2
although
great
have
a
woefully
out
of
date
tech
technology_5
basically
we
weren’t
use
technology_1
or
pattern_1
yet
so
i
have
to
look
outside
of
the
requirement_2
if
i
want
to
more
about
either
of
those
thing
the
easy
way
to
be
by
do
it
so
i
decide
to
create
a
to
do
component_1
and
document
my
experience
for
future
reference
overview
my
goal
for
this
be
to
have
a
component_2
walkthrough
for
different
pattern_1
i’m
not
plan
to
go
deep
in
the
concept
and
technology_6
there
be
a
lot
of
about
those
out
there
my
intention
here
be
to
present
an
component_3
example
contain
the
pattern_2
technology_6
technology_7
use
to
develop
pattern_1
since
this
be
a
reference
component_3
i
have
intentionally
make
it
a
quality_attribute_2
a
possible
so
the
component_2
be
easy
to
understand
you
should
follow
along
at
home
and
be
able
to
run
this
component_3
on
your
own
component_4
a
a
reference
in
this
we
be
go
to
work
with
a
“to
do”
component_3
which
will
be
compose
of
component_3
reminder
component_5
component_6
discovery
component_7
mailer
oauth
component_7
component_1
requirement_3
test
component_8
gateway
web
component_3
component_9
this
will
provide
an
overview
of
the
whole
project
late
i
will
explain
more
deeply
about
what
and
how
we
be
use
the
component_10
in
each
pattern_3
how
our
component_1
will
work
with
pattern_1
in
the
image
above
you
can
see
how
our
component_1
connector_3
along
with
all
pattern_1
the
component_5
will
connector_4
a
web
component_3
connector_5
use
angular
it
will
then
connector_6
to
an
oauth
pattern_4
component_7
which
will
be
a
central
point
of
where
component_11
and
authority
can
be
assign
this
component_7
will
a
technology_8
web
connector_data_1
contain
info
about
the
component_9
with
it
authority
and
the
grate
scope
after
the
component_5
be
pattern_5
and
have
a
connector_data_1
the
web
component_3
will
be
able
to
talk
to
the
component_8
gateway
it
will
take
the
jwt
verify
if
it’s
come
from
the
pattern_4
component_7
and
then
make
connector_data_2
to
the
pattern_1
and
build
the
connector_7
see
more
technology_4
pattern_1
architecture
in
pcf
and
technology_9
the
oauth
component_7
u
the
component_5
component_6
to
connector_1
the
user’s
pattern_6
detail
also
the
component_8
gateway
u
the
oauth
component_7
to
connector_1
the
user’s
connector_data_3
the
remainder
component_6
be
where
be
place
the
todo
requirement_4
the
todo
component_6
have
a
schedule
to
connector_8
for
reminder
and
connector_9
the
component_5
by
the
be
connector_10
by
the
mailer
component_6
which
be
connector_11
from
reminder
component_6
by
use
technology_10
the
component_1
requirement_3
test
be
a
technology_1
component_3
responsible
for
reach
the
reminder
service’s
connector_6
pattern_1
in
pattern_3
architecture
we
have
to
deal
with
many
pattern_1
run
in
different
ip
and
port
therefore
we
need
to
find
a
way
of
manage
each
connector_12
without
hard
cod
this
be
where
netflix
eureka
come
to
the
rescue
it
be
a
component_9
side
component_6
discovery
that
allow
component_12
to
find
and
connector_13
with
each
other
automatically
we
be
use
technology_4
requirement_5
eureka
in
our
component_1
you
should
take
a
look
at
how
it
work
so
you
can
understand
how
our
pattern_7
component_12
be
connector_13
between
different
pattern_1
once
eureka
care
about
where
the
component_12
be
run
we
can
instance
and
apply
load
balance
to
quality_attribute_3
the
incoming
component_3
traffic
between
our
pattern_1
see
more
technology_4
pattern_7
component_12
and
pattern_1
in
our
component_1
we
be
use
netflix
ribbon
a
a
component_9
side
load
balancer
that
enable
u
to
achieve
fault
tolerance
and
increase
the
quality_attribute_4
and
quality_attribute_5
through
pattern_8
we
be
use
netflix
foreign
for
connector_14
declarative
pattern_7
component_9
and
quality_attribute_6
ribbon
and
eureka
to
provide
a
load
balance
technology_11
component_9
our
component_1
do
have
some
connector_15
we
be
try
to
isolate
our
component_3
from
connector_15
failure
use
netflix
hystrix
circuit
breaker
it
help
stop
cascade
failure
and
allow
u
to
fail
fast
and
rapid
recovery
or
fallback
hystrix
maintain
a
component_13
pool
for
each
connector_15
it
reject
connector_data_4
instead
of
pattern_9
them
if
the
component_13
pool
become
exhaust
it
also
provide
circuit
breaker
requirement_4
that
can
stop
all
connector_data_4
to
a
connector_15
you
can
also
connector_2
fallback
component_14
when
a
connector_data_5
be
fail
reject
or
time
out
pattern_6
quality_attribute_7
be
something
very
important
when
develop
any
kind
of
component_1
pattern_1
architecture
be
no
different
“how
can
i
maintain
quality_attribute_7
in
my
pattern_1
”
come
up
immediately
and
the
first
answer
be
oauth2
oauth2
be
definitely
a
quality_attribute_1
solution
it
be
a
well
pattern_4
technology_7
that
be
widely
use
for
and
technology_12
anyways
it’s
impossible
to
talk
about
quality_attribute_7
without
mention
technology_4
quality_attribute_7
i
use
it
alongside
oauth2
in
this
project
technology_4
quality_attribute_7
and
oauth2
be
obvious
choice
when
talk
about
quality_attribute_8
quality_attribute_3
component_1
see
more
netflix
open
component_2
conductor
a
pattern_1
pattern_10
component_15
however
we
be
one
more
element
to
our
quality_attribute_7
concern
technology_8
web
connector_data_1
jwt
if
we
be
only
use
oauth
we
would
need
to
have
an
oauth
pattern_4
component_7
to
pattern_5
the
component_5
generate
the
connector_data_1
a
well
a
act
a
an
for
the
resource
component_16
to
ask
if
the
connector_data_1
be
valid
and
which
permission
do
it
grant
this
require
twice
more
connector_data_4
to
the
pattern_4
component_7
than
we
really
need
jwt
provide
a
quality_attribute_2
way
of
connector_16
the
permission
and
component_5
connector_data_6
in
the
connector_4
connector_data_1
once
all
connector_data_6
be
already
in
the
connector_data_1
the
resource
component_16
don’t
need
to
ask
for
connector_data_1
connector_8
all
the
connector_data_3
be
serialize
into
technology_8
first
encode
with
base64
and
finally
sign
with
a
private
rsa
key
it
be
assume
that
all
resource
component_16
will
have
a
key
to
connector_8
if
the
connector_data_1
be
sign
for
the
proper
private
key
and
deserialize
the
connector_data_1
to
have
the
connector_data_3
you
can
have
a
look
at
the
oauth2
pattern_4
component_7
oauth
component_7
and
the
resource
component_7
technology_13
gateway
implementation
to
see
the
look
the
implementation
be
do
follow
mainly
this
pattern_7
in
our
component_1
we
have
two
connector_17
style
pattern_11
and
pattern_12
for
the
pattern_13
style
we
be
use
quality_attribute_3
with
technology_10
follow
the
component_17
publish
subscribe
for
synch
we
have
pattern_7
style
support
technology_8
and
technology_14
there
be
four
level
of
maturity
of
restful
start
at
level
a
describe
for
martin
fowler
here
our
pattern_1
be
in
the
level
because
i
decide
not
connector_2
the
hypermedia
control
use
the
hateoas
design
pattern_2
for
the
quality_attribute_9
because
we
be
use
technology_4
requirement_5
we
have
to
out
of
component_18
some
quality_attribute_10
pattern_2
which
be
place
in
our
technology_11
connector_18
that
deserve
a
mention
circuit
breaker
bulkhead
load
balance
connector_18
pool
timeouts
and
retry
quality_attribute_3
a
mention
above
our
connector_19
between
the
reminder
component_6
and
mailer
component_6
be
do
asynchronously
use
technology_10
to
quality_attribute_3
our
across
the
others
pattern_1
in
the
reminder
component_6
we
have
a
schedule
connector_data_7
to
connector_8
for
reminder
time
and
publish
the
remainderfound
there
will
be
a
subscribe
in
the
mailer
component_6
which
will
start
the
component_19
of
connector_20
an
to
the
component_5
i
invite
you
to
have
a
look
at
how
we
be
do
this
requirement_3
and
how
i
connector_5
the
serialization
deserialization
of
the
connector_data_6
connector_10
to
technology_10
in
the
technology_10
component_2
and
cqrs
monolithic
component_20
typically
have
a
single
relational
component_21
we
can
use
acid
transaction
a
a
connector_data_8
our
component_3
can
simply
begin
a
transaction
connector_21
multiple
row
and
connector_22
the
transaction
if
everything
go
right
or
rollback
if
something
go
wrong
unfortunately
to
deal
with
connector_data_6
connector_4
in
the
pattern_3
architecture
be
much
more
complex
this
be
due
to
the
fact
that
the
connector_data_6
be
quality_attribute_3
in
different
component_21
connector_23
requirement_6
transaction
across
multiple
component_12
be
a
big
challenge
see
more
from
the
monolith
to
pattern_1
in
our
“todo”
project
we
be
use
to
deal
with
requirement_6
transaction
that
span
multiple
component_6
you
can
look
at
the
implementation
of
component_2
with
cqrs
apply
in
the
mailer
component_6
you
can
see
how
to
separate
connector_24
and
connector_25
that
enable
u
to
quality_attribute_11
each
part
easily
we
be
use
a
relational
component_21
a
an
component_22
and
then
quality_attribute_3
the
use
technology_10
we
will
need
to
make
these
two
action
atomic
and
avoid
connector_26
the
that
way
it
won’t
publish
an
eventual
technology_15
crash
i’m
not
use
technology_10
a
the
component_22
because
be
quality_attribute_2
to
construct
the
aggregate
from
a
relational
component_21
we
be
try
to
make
thing
easy
here
next
step
a
you
can
notice
we
already
have
a
lot
of
thing
in
this
project
and
there
be
still
many
challenge
that
be
not
connector_12
here
yet
however
this
be
a
project
in
development
and
we
be
plan
more
thing
into
it
such
a
technology_4
requirement_5
config
container
with
technology_16
continuous
requirement_3
with
technology_17
quality_attribute_3
trace
with
technology_4
sleuth
requirement_7
requirement_8
with
elk
and
more
so
keep
tune
on
our
technology_18
pattern_14
to
see
more
fun
thing
some
reference
below
i
have
a
fairly
extensive
connector_data_9
of
reference
that
be
very
helpful
for
me
so
take
a
look
if
you
think
there’s
something
that
you’re
not
clear
on
quality_attribute_1
luck
pattern_1

component_20
