technology_1
cluster
configuration
for
technology_2
technology_1
be
a
fantastic
piece
of
when
it
come
to
pattern_1
and
multiplexing
this
will
show
one
way
to
quality_attribute_1
a
technology_1
cluster
within
technology_2
iâve
struggle
quite
a
bit
with
this
have
never
set
up
technology_1
before
and
at
the
time
have
almost
no
experience
with
technology_2
a
well
when
i
finally
do
connector_1
it
to
run
however
it
run
smoothly
and
hasnât
be
anything
but
quality_attribute_2
since
in
the
follow
example
configuration
weâll
be
use
the
rabbitmq_peer_discovery_k8s
technology_1
plugin
for
cluster
there
be
several
different
of
do
this
in
the
past
but
right
now
this
be
the
recommend
and
support
way
to
do
it
technology_1
configuration
first
we
will
go
over
the
configuration
for
technology_1
in
this
requirement_1
we
will
simply
create
a
custom
technology_3
image
which
include
most
of
the
configuration
we
need
a
a
base
image
we
use
the
official
technology_1
technology_3
image
and
copy
in
our
own
technology_1
conf
and
enabled_plugins
from
technology_1
technology_1
conf
etc
technology_1
enabled_plugins
etc
technology_1
the
enabled_plugins
which
the
rabbitmq_peer_discovery_k8s
plugin
and
the
technology_4
requirement_2
plugin
look
this
rabbitmq_management
rabbitmq_peer_discovery_k8s
so
far
so
quality_attribute_3
now
it
connector_2
a
bit
more
interest
in
technology_1
conf
we
actually
configure
the
peer
discovery
mechanism
which
will
enable
our
technology_1
technology_5
to
find
each
other
inside
the
technology_2
cluster
late
on

first
we
specify
that
we
want
to
use
rabbit_peer_discovery_k8s
a
our
discovery
backend
then
we
define
the
k8s
component_1
for
component_2
connector_3
and
that
we
use
hostname
a
an
connector_4
technology_9
there
be
also
an
ip
option
but
hostname
be
recommend
however
hostname
can
only
be
use
with
stateful
set
in
technology_2
which
be
what
we
plan
to
do
anyway
then
we
specify
the
name
of
the
technology_1
component_3
in
technology_2
and
the
hostname
suffix
which
define
that
our
technology_5
will
be
name
rabbit@rabbitmq
technology_1
internal
example
svc
cluster
local
with
the
number
count
up
e
g
technology_1
2â¦
there
be
some
additional
set
here
but
what
weâre
mostly
interest
in
be
the
technology_2
configuration
option
alright
the
next
step
be
the
technology_2
configuration
technology_2
configuration
the
technology_1
setup
on
technology_2
be
base
on
a
statefulset
configuration
we
also
set
up
two
component_3
one
for
connector_5
the
pod
from
the
outside
and
one
for
peer
discovery
between
the
individual
technology_1
pod
weâll
start
off
with
the
le
interest
part
rbac
config
and
a
general
configmap
and
then
move
on
to
the
more
interest
and
important
configuration

connector_data_1

which
allow

all
and
then
hook
them
up
with
a

alright
with
that
out
of
the

a
mention
above
we
need
two
component_5
in
this
requirement_1
one
connector_7
technology_1
for
connector_5
the
technology_1
pod
from
outside
other
part
of
our
technology_2
cluster
and
another
one
connector_7
technology_1
internal
which
be
use
by
the
technology_1
pod
to
do
peer
discovery
and
to
create
the
technology_1
cluster
between
them
now
weâll
take
a
look
at
the
core
part
of
the
technology_2
configuration
the
statefulset
it
be
rather
long

donât

we
start
out
rather
basic
define
a
technology_1
statefulset
configure
update
strategy
component_3
and
replica
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
there
but
then
we
connector_1
to
the
pod
template
the
first
interest
part
be
the
poststart
lifecycle
hook
this
hook
connector_9
a
script
which
first
wait
until
the
technology_5
be
healthy
and
then
set
the
ha
mode
this
be
the
high
quality_attribute_4
mode
configuration
of
technology_1
we
set
it
to
our
custom
requirement_4
ha
two
which
mean
that
the
whole
component_7
will
be
mirror
to
two
of
the
three
technology_5
in
the
cluster
so
itâs
very
unlikely
we
lose
connector_data_1
even
if
technology_5
die
itâs
important
to
mention
here
that
there
be
in
fact
many
different
way
to
configure
high
quality_attribute_4
in
technology_1
which
set
to
use
will
quality_attribute_5
on
your
use
requirement_1
for
more
connector_data_3
connector_8
out
these
resource
on
mirror
component_8
and
the
quorum
component_7
this
mean
more
synchronization
work
which
have
a
requirement_5
tax
but
there
be
also
other
set
for
component_7
mirror
and
you
should
take
the
one
suit
your
need
the
best
next
up
we
define
port
and
resource
limit
which
be
not
that
interest
but
then
we
define
the
livenessprobe
and
the
readinessprobe
there
several
way
to
connector_8
if
a
technology_1
instance
be
healthy
or
ready
there
be
even
a
detail
about
the
topic
in
this
requirement_1
we
use
the
recommend
approach
use
technology_1
diagnostics
the
advantage
of
this
approach
be
that
the
impact
on
the
technology_1
instance
be
very
little
whereas
a
full
status
query
would
take
some
time
to
fulfill
the
disadvantage
be
of
that
itâs
only
a
very
basic
test
and
there
could
be
hide
issue
while
connector_10
to
our
test
component_7
would
still
work
fine
everythingâs
a
requirement_6
off
this
be
a
quality_attribute_6
solution
but
there
be
other
more
sophisticate
way
to
do
this
iâm
sure
which
might
fit
your
need
quality_attribute_3
at
the
end
of
the
statefulset
configuration
we
configure
it
to
use
our
above
mention
configmap
and
some
environment
variable
this
be
important
because
some
of
these
be
relevant
for
the
peer
discovery
mechanism
letâs
go
through
them
one
by
one
hostname
we
take
this
from
the
metadata
it
will
simply
be
technology_1
n
namespace
we
also
take
this
from
the
metadata
we
will
need
it
further
down
for
create
the
technology_5
name
rabbitmq_use_longname
use
fully
qualify
name
to
identify
rmq
technology_5
rabbitmq_nodename
this
be
the
technology_5
name
of
the
pod
base
on
the
peer
discovery
config
e
g
rabbit@rabbitmq
technology_1
internal
example
svc

local
k8s_service_name
the
k8s
component_3
name
rabbitmq_default_user
login
component_9
rabbitmq_default_pass
login
pw
rabbitmq_erlang_cookie
the
technology_14
node_name
the
short
technology_5
name
also
generate
from
the
metadata
same
a
the
hostname
alright
thatâs
the
whole
config
if
we
be
to
run
this
on
a
test
technology_2
cluster
or
locally
in
minikube
we
should
connector_1
multiple
technology_1
instance
spawn
after
one
another
and
find
each
other
in
the
cluster
yay
conclusion
set
up
the
technology_1
cluster
inside
technology_2
take
me
quite
a
while
when
i
first
do
it
a
itâs
a
bit
hard
to
find
up
to
date
documentation
a
well
a
concrete
example
so
i
hope
this
have
help
a
a
point
to
start
from
i
realize
that
this
cover
a
lot
of
stuff
and
that
it
doesnât
go
into
any
detail
and
frankly
i
wouldnât
say
iâm
an
expert
on
technology_1
or
technology_2
but
for
simply
set
this
up
thatâs
also
not
necessary
however
if
you
want
to
run
something
this
in
production
it
would
definitely
make
sense
to
dive
a
bit
deep
a
big
thank
you
to
michaelklishin
of
the
technology_1
core
team
for
point
out
a
quality_attribute_3
way
to
