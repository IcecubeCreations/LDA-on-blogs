mean
once

it

although
if

if

then
the

in

to
understand

u
take
an

example
the

agent
be

form
i
e
single

in

example
the

with
which
we
define

and
channel1
be
the
name
of

connector_6
and

respectively
and
their
type
and
location
be
also
mention
accordingly
advantage
of
technology_1
technology_2
technology_2
be

these
property
be
discuss
in
detail
below
quality_attribute_5
–
technology_2
be
quality_attribute_5
horizontally
i
e
we
can
technology_14
a
per
our
requirement
quality_attribute_6
–
technology_1
technology_2
have
support
for
transaction
and
ensure
that
no
connector_data_1
be
lose
in
the
component_9
of
connector_data_1
transmission
it
have
different
transaction
from
component_5
to
pattern_2
and
from
pattern_2
to
component_5
technology_2
be
quality_attribute_7
and
provide
support
for
various
component_6
and
connector_6
technology_10
avro
spool
directory
technology_15
etc
in
technology_5
a
single
component_5
can
connector_3
connector_data_1
to
multiple
pattern_2
and
those
pattern_2
in
turn
will
connector_3
the
connector_data_1
to
multiple
connector_6
thus
a
single
component_5
can
connector_3
connector_data_1
to
multiple
connector_6
this
mechanism
be
connector_12
fan
out
technology_2
also
support
fan
out
technology_2
provide
the
steady
flow
of

transmission
i
e
if
connector_data_1
connector_20
quality_attribute_8
increase
and
then
connector_data_1
connector_21
quality_attribute_8
also
increase
although
technology_2
generally
connector_1
connector_data_1
to
centralized
storage
technology_11
or
technology_6
we
can
configure
technology_2
a
per
our
requirement
such
that
