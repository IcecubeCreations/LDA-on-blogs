a

reserve
not
only
for
big
playersthe
level
of
complexity
that
surround
u
be
great
than
ever
and
every
requirement_1
be
constantly
be
challenge
by
competitor
and
technology_10
moreover
requirement_5
be
embrace
technology_10
rapidly
and
become
the
big
driver
of
connector_2
in
the
end
it’s
mainly
requirement_5
focus
that
dictate
your
strategy
a
a
brand
you
must
create
personalize
experience
by
understand
requirement_5
need
and
their
journey
in
a
connector_data_1
drive
way
but
about
your
requirement_5
cannot
be
pattern_2
into
quality_attribute_1
strategy
unless
you
can
drive
insight
from
the
right
connector_data_1
at
the
right
time
unfortunately
connector_data_1
can
originate
in
a
number
of
different
component_4
and
it’s
difficult
to
connector_3
it
when
you
need
it
and
in
a
clean
form
the
challenge
remain
how
to
make
decision
with
a
fast
time
to
requirement_6
in
this
you’ll
find
out
how
combine
a
traditional
dataset
with
technology_9
technology_1
can
serve
a
the
single
component_5
of
truth
and
in
turn
help
you
become
requirement_5
focus
how
to
put
connector_data_1
into
actionfirst
let’s
uncover
what
connector_data_1
be
the
most
significant
for
modern
requirement_1
requirement_7
a
classic
approach
to
connector_data_1
which
be
a
technology_11
for
year
be
pattern_1
component_3
it
mean
that
you
copy
component_6
entry
in
periodic
duplicative
pattern_1
and
everything
run
on
a
fix
schedule
this
approach
doesn’t
quality_attribute_2
anymore
because
the
requirement_1
environment
be
increasingly
urgent
and
you
often
cannot
wait
to
act
upon
it
make
inform
decision
base
on
old
connector_data_1
be
not
even
an
option
you
can
rely
on
solution
and
crm
to
quickly
generate
some
useful
metric
but
these
technology_6
be
not
enough
to
generate
insight
after
capture
the
most
current
connector_4
in
your
requirement_1
in
reality
most
of
what
a
requirement_1
do
can
be
describe
a
connector_1
of
and
you
should
at
least
be
able
to
component_3
them
incrementally
a
they
happen
to
avoid
bottleneck
each
component_7
generate
that
when
component_3
in
real
time
give
you
competitive
advantage
and
confidence
in
requirement_1
connector_data_2
error
requirement_8
quality_attribute_3
metric
and
so
on
compile
with
pattern_3
connector_data_1
play
a
pivotal
role
in
generate
revenue
to
quality_attribute_4
connector_5
the
connector_data_1
you
want
between
component_7
you
need
to
connector_6
real
time
connector_7
connector_data_1
pipeline
what
be
connector_data_1
connector_1
and
connector_8
component_3
component_8
me
explain
further
requirement_5
be
connector_9
with
your
requirement_1
on
many
component_9
and
pattern_4
these
footprint
create
volume
of
pattern_3
connector_data_1
in
the
form
of
various
component_10
recommendation
search
social
connector_10
inside
component_11
behaviour
all
these
combine
with
operational
connector_data_1
and
pattern_3
connector_data_1
capture
when
the
technology_5
be
sell
or
purchase
be
inform
multiple
of
your
requirement_1
in
the
ideal
world
relevant
connector_data_1
be
use
for
requirement_1
requirement_7
and
the
connector_data_3
be
connector_8
into
operational
component_12
or
requirement_1
intelligence
technology_6
to
improve
the
requirement_1
component_13
and
make
the
right
decision
there
be
no
gap
in
your
connector_data_1
infrastructure
and
you
can
easily
tie
connector_10
together
to
create
a
single
digital
profile
of
your
requirement_5
but
that’s
the
ideal
world
in
reality
many
be
far
away
from
be
truly
connector_data_1
drive
and
still
search
for
a
quality_attribute_5
way
to
ingest
connector_data_1
for
analysis
and
report
this
be
where
solution
technology_9
technology_1
come
in
they
allow
you
to
create
connector_data_1
connector_7
component_9
focus
on
a
flow
of
real
time
connector_data_1
connector_8
when
we
take
a
look
at
it
component_7
usually
the
same
connector_data_1
be
be
use
by
multiple
component_14
simultaneously
component_14
can
serve
the
connector_data_1
in
different
way
they
might
be
connector_7
component_8
pattern_1
component_8
or
micro
pattern_1
component_8
they
also
connector_11
connector_data_1
in
different
way
in
various
use
requirement_9
that
apply
here
in
order
to
be
real
time
you
need
a
pattern_5
component_7
that
immediately
“tells”
our
component_15
that
some
connector_data_1
originate
in
one
place
and
have
to
be
component_3
this
architectural
pattern_6
be
connector_12
an
drive
architecture
where
developer
use
quality_attribute_6
computing
component_16
to
design
for
example
connector_7
component_15
an
connector_7
component_15
have
two
primary
u
connector_8
component_3
the
ability
to
continuously
technology_12
to
component_3
or
transform
connector_data_1
connector_8
connector_data_1
requirement_10
the
ability
to
capture
connector_1
of
or
connector_data_1
connector_4
and
to
fee
these
to
other
connector_data_1
component_12
such
a
relational
component_6
connector_data_1
lake
or
connector_data_1
requirement_11
technology_9
technology_1
be
a
requirement_3
technology_6
that
have
become
an
connector_7
component_17
that
combine
connector_data_4
storage
and
connector_data_1
component_3
far
beyond
pattern_7
use
requirement_9
it
be
initially
design
for
technology_1
be
be
use
for
build
core
in
a
form
of
various
connector_7
component_15
connector_13
more
what
be
technology_9
technology_1
how
to
leverage
a
connector_7
approach
and
requirement_3
technology_6
technology_1
the
big
player
set
a
quality_attribute_7
example
on
how
to
benefit
from
connector_data_1
drive
requirement_1
requirement_7
when
design
and
you’ve
probably
hear
that
connector_8
component_3
be
connector_6
in
requirement_12
that
component_3
mountain
of
connector_data_1
we
also
already
connector_14
about
the
most
well
technology_1
use
requirement_9
but
be
connector_data_1
drive
be
not
only
the
modus
operandi
of
large
organization
netflix
or
uber
accord
to
stackshare
currently
there
be
almost
requirement_12
that
use
technology_9
technology_1
for
example
netflix
lately
leverage
it
to
plan
determine
spend
and
account
for
all
it’s
content
which
be
estimate
to
be
at
the
requirement_6
of
$15billion
but
what
about
small
requirement_1
be
there
a
place
for
technology_1
in
their
infrastructure
let’s
for
example
take
a
look
at
the
ecommerce
requirement_1
due
to
the
nature
of
the
online
retail
ecommerce
component_9
work
hour
a
day
and
therefore
must
be
quality_attribute_8
on
a
component_7
feature
self
heal
a
well
a
load
balance
when
run
an
online
component_18
you
also
need
to
pattern_8
the
infrastructure
health
and
requirement_13
and
capture
metric
to
derive
requirement_1
requirement_6
in
real
time
these
connector_data_1
volume
demand
not
quality_attribute_1
storage
capability
but
also
the
ability
to
quality_attribute_2
during
peak
hour
it’s
an
ideal
use
requirement_9
of
connector_8
component_3
component_14
that
be
resilient
and
quality_attribute_9
take
a
look
at
this
requirement_9
study
it’s
not
only
retail
that
produce
and
component_13
connector_1
of
with
pattern_3
connector_data_1
it’s
also
other
type
of
requirement_1
that
can
be
see
this
way
when
design
to
streamline
their
for
logistics
it’s
the
pattern_3
connector_data_1
that
can
occur
a
when
order
shipment
and
other
connector_4
of
state
in
the
logistic
chain
happen
for
fintech
requirement_12
the
include
currency
requirement_6
requirement_14
requirement_15
and
for
any
digital
requirement_1
these
might
be
click
visit
search
etc
netflix
spotify
or
uber
lead
by
example
but
make
the
right
connector_data_1
quality_attribute_10
at
the
right
time
be
an
objective
that
each
modern
organization
should
focus
on
how
to
design
requirement_3
how
to
design
your
connector_data_1
connector_7
and
connector_data_1
requirement_10
that
leverage
technology_1
let’s
start
from
a
sketch
and
stick
to
the
ecommerce
example
a
i
mention
before
connector_data_1
be
often
not
connector_11
by
one
component_15
but
by
several
different
component_15
beside
the
need
to
connector_6
pattern_5
technology_6
you
also
need
a
solution
that
connector_15
connector_data_1
and
decouple
each
component_19
and
component_20
from
one
another
technology_9
technology_1
be
a
quality_attribute_7
solution
for
both
these
requirement
a
your
can
be
now
component_3
in
real
time
the
component_7
miss
the
quality_attribute_11
into
the
technology_11
pattern_9
technology_6
so
you
can
act
upon
relevant
connector_data_1
and
from
actionable
metric
in
the
picture
above
technology_1
act
a
the
core
foundation
of
a
modern
requirement_10
pattern_10
of
the
requirement_3
accord
to
confluent’s
survey
66%
of
requirement_12
use
it
for
connector_8
component_3
60%
use
it
for
connector_data_1
requirement_10
and
the
most
common
use
requirement_9
for
technology_1
be
connector_data_1

81%
and
pattern_11
51%
find
out
what
be

and
what
be
their
benefit
what
be
the
requirement_1
benefit
of
connector_data_1
connector_1
with
technology_1
for
most
modern
requirement_1
their
core
connector_data_1
be
continuous
not
pattern_1
it
s
non

that
you
have
