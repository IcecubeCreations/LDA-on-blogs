face

imagine
you
have
your
own
component_7
for
example
it
s
an
online
component_8
so
you
permanently
work
in
your
technological
scope
and
one
day
you
need
to
make
the
component_7
connector_5
with
another
one
in
previous
time
you
would
use
quality_attribute_1
in
point
of
the
component_2
to
component_2
connector_4
but
nowadays
we
have
special
connector_data_1
pattern_1
they
make
the
component_9
of
connector_data_2
exchange
quality_attribute_1
and

these

use

the
necessity
to

about

requirement_15
this
confuse
term
be
crucial
for

use
to
think
about
requirement_15
in

both
of
them
have
some
pro
and
con
the
advantage
of
the

be
the

easily
quality_attribute_9
the

provide

quality_attribute_10
be

magically
combine
these

component_9
connector_16
benefit
of
both
of

it
should
be

that
this

provide

peculiarity
combine
the
of

technology_2
isn

pattern_1
it
s
a
powerful
connector_1
component_15
capable
of
handle
trillion
of
connector_data_6
a
day
technology_2
be
useful
both
for
connector_17
and
component_9
historical
connector_data_2
from

work
you
can
use

a
for

connector_data_2
pipeline
if
you
want
to
follow
the
step
of
technology_2
component_23
you
should
be
mindful
of
some
nuance
the
connector_data_6
t
have
separate
they
be
connector_18
by

in

this

you

if

exchange
in

the
