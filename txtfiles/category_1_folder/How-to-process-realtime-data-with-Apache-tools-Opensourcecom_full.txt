require

before

simply
say
the

in

some

show
that
it

never

for

in
these

there

and
prediction
component_1
in
the
requirement_2

to
an
inescapable
quality_attribute_5
of
about
half
a

connector_data_1
often

to
the

when

connector_data_1
the

distribution
component_16
such

this
leave
an
enormous
amount
of

for

connector_data_5

be

kind
of

for

quality_attribute_2
connector_data_1
component_1
often
technology_1
technology_21
connector_6
be
use
a
a
connector_7
processor
for
example
to
fee
requirement_8
component_20
with
connector_data_1
technology_21
connector_6
break
connector_data_1

some
other
component_16
the
connector_7
of
be
group
into
mini
pattern_10
for
analysis
but
the
connector_7
processor
itself
must
be
elastic
the
connector_7
processor
must
be
capable
of
quality_attribute_7
with
the
connector_data_1
rate
even
across
component_22
and
requirement_2
and
also
balance
load
across
instance
ensure
quality_attribute_8
and
other
component_13
pattern_11
need
it
must
be
able
to
analyze
connector_data_1
from
component_15
that
report
at
widely
different
rat
mean
it
must
be
stateful—or
component_10
state
in
a
component_8
this
latter
approach
be
often
use
when
technology_21
connector_6
be
use
a
the
connector_7
processor
and
can
cause
requirement_9
problem
when
ultra

samza
offer
a
way
to
component_1

connector_7
and
to
quality_attribute_2
elastically
use
technology_22
technology_23
or
technology_1
mesos
to
manage
compute
resource
solve
the
problem
of
quality_attribute_7
connector_data_1
it
s
important
to
note
that
even
samza
cannot
entirely
alleviate
connector_data_1
component_1
demand
for
the
component_13
developer
quality_attribute_7
connector_data_1
rat
mean
that
connector_data_7
to
component_1
need
to
be
load
balance
across
many
instance
and
the
only
way
to
connector_15
the
connector_data_8
component_13
pattern_11
state
between
instance
be
to
use
a
component_8
however
the
moment
state
coordination
between
connector_data_7
of
an
component_13
devolve
to
a
component_8
there
be
an
inevitable
knock
on
effect
upon
requirement_9
moreover
the
choice
of
component_8
be
crucial
a
the
component_16
quality_attribute_2
cluster
requirement_10
for
the
component_8
become
the
next
potential
bottleneck
this
can
be
solve
with
alternative
solution
that
be
stateful
elastic
and
can
be
use
in
place
of
a
connector_7
processor
at
the
component_13
level
within
each
container
or

these

build

agent
thus
form
a
graph
of
concurrent
component_17
that
can
analyze
their
own
state
and
the
state
of

to
which
they
be
connector_17
each
agent
provide
a
nano
component_18
for
a
single
connector_data_1
component_23
that
convert
from
raw
connector_data_1
to
state
and
analyze

and
predict
from
it
own
connector_18
and
those
of
it
connector_17
subgraph
these
solution
simplify

architecture
by
allow

even
while
maintain
the
quality_attribute_6
graph
that
interlink
them
at
the
component_13
pattern_11
this
be
because
the
connector_19
be
url
that
connector_data_9
to
the
current

of

and
the

they
also
compute

there
