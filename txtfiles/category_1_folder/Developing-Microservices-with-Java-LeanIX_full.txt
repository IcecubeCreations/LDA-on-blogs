have
also
see

cut
by

a
75%
when
use

developer
commonly
use

one
of
the
official

of

there

yet

still
firmly
hold
it
place
close
to
a
developer
heart
battle
in
close
competition
with
technology_9
and

there
be
certain
technology_11
and
for
incorporate
pattern_1
with

a
we
will
detail
below
what
be
pattern_1
pattern_1
be
a
specialization
of
an

approach
for

with
each

over
a
requirement_13
in
order
to
fulfill
a
goal
these
component_6
use
technology_3
agnostic
technology_13
the
pattern_1
approach
be
the
first
realization
of
pattern_5
that
follow
the
introduction
of

and
be
become
more
popular
for
build
continuously
quality_attribute_8
component_12
in
short
component_11
design
use
this
architecture
be
comprise
of
small
modular
independent
component_2
there
be
many
benefit
of
have
single

separate
component_6
with
their
own
support
base
these
component_6
be
loosely
couple
connector_11
through
component_14
and
be
easy
to
develop
update
and
maintain
by
break
down
a
large
monolithic
component_3
into

have
a
special
mean
by
now
monolithic

web
component_11
connector_12
in

be
old
fashion
nevertheless
it
be
quality_attribute_4
to
have
a
valuable
successful
component_3
that
be
build
a
a
monolith
than
not
connector_3
requirement_10
requirement_5
at
all
pattern_1
be
a
form
of
technology_12
and
pattern_5
be
one
of
the
most
important
skill
for
technology_1
developer
due
to
the
loosely
couple
nature
of
pattern_1
it
be
imperative
to
find
a
way
of
manage
each
connector_13
without
strenuous
cod

in
the

ecosystem
include

container
le

package

the
advantage
of
this
approach
include
the
ease
of
start

stop
component_6
a
need
when
quality_attribute_1
it
be
also
extremely
convenient
