free
technology_1
with
real
time
project
start
now
in
our
last
technology_1

we
discuss
book
for
technology_1
today
we
will
discus
the
advantage
and
disadvantage
of
technology_1
because
it
be
very
important
to
the
limitation
of
any
technology_24
before
use
it
same
in
requirement_5
of
advantage
so
let’s
discus
technology_1
advantage
and
disadvantage
in
detail
advantage
of
technology_1
so
here
we
be
connector_data_2
out
some
of
the
advantage
of
technology_1
basically
these
technology_1
advantage
be
make
technology_1
ideal
for
our
connector_data_1
lake
implementation
so
let’s
start

advantage
of
technology_1
in
detail
technology_1
pro
and
con
–
technology_1
advantage
a
high
quality_attribute_1
without
have
not
so
large
hardware
technology_1
be
capable
of
handle
high
technology_25
and
high
volume
connector_data_1
also
able
to
support
connector_data_3
quality_attribute_1
of
thousand
of
connector_data_4
per
second
b
low
quality_attribute_2
it
be
capable
of
handle
these
connector_data_4
with
the
very
low
quality_attribute_2
of
the
range
of
millisecond
demand
by
most
of
the
use
requirement_5
technology_26
fault
tolerant
one
of
the
best
advantage
be
fault
tolerance
there
be
an
inherent
capability
in
technology_1
to
be
resistant
to
technology_27
component_1
failure
within
a
cluster
technology_28
quality_attribute_3
here
quality_attribute_3
refer
to
the
persistence
of
connector_data_1
connector_data_3
on
disk
also
connector_data_4
pattern_2
be
one
of
the
reason
behind
quality_attribute_3
hence
connector_data_4
be
never
lose
e
quality_attribute_4
without
incur
any
downtime
on
the
fly
by

additional
technology_27
technology_1
can
be
quality_attribute_5
out
moreover
inside
the
technology_1
cluster
the
connector_data_3
handle
be
fully
quality_attribute_6
and
these
be
seamless
f
quality_attribute_7
the
quality_attribute_7
architecture
of
technology_1
make
it
quality_attribute_8
use
capability
pattern_2
and
partitioning
g
connector_data_3
pattern_3
capability
technology_1
tend
to
work
very
well
a
a
replacement
for
a
more
traditional
connector_data_3
pattern_3
here
a
connector_data_3
pattern_3
refer
to
an
pattern_4
component_2
which
pattern_5
connector_data_4
from
the
formal
pattern_6
technology_29
of
the
pattern_7
to
the
formal
pattern_6
technology_29
of
the
receiver
h
high
pattern_8
technology_1
be
able
to
handle
thousand
of
connector_data_4
per
second
and
that
too
in
low
quality_attribute_2
condition
with
high
quality_attribute_1
in
addition
it
permit
the
connector_1
and
connector_2
of
connector_data_4
into
it
at
high
pattern_8
i
by
default
persistent
a
we
discuss
above
that
the
connector_data_4
be
persistent
that
make
it
quality_attribute_9
and
quality_attribute_10
j
component_3
friendly
it
be
possible
to
quality_attribute_11
with
the
variety
of
component_4
use
technology_1
the
best
part
of
technology_1
be
it
can
behave
or
act
differently
accord
to
the
component_3
that
it
quality_attribute_11
with
because
each
requirement_6
have
a
different
ability
to
handle
these
connector_data_3
come
out
of
technology_1
moreover
technology_1
can
quality_attribute_11
well
with
a
variety
of
component_4
connector_3
in
a
variety
of
technology_30
k
pattern_9
handle
capable
technology_31
requirement_7
technology_1
could
also
be
employ
for
pattern_9

use
requirement_5
and
can
also
do
the
work
of
a
traditional
technology_31
due
to
it
capability
of
persist
connector_data_3
l
variety
of
use
requirement_5
it
be
able
to
manage
the
variety
of
use
requirement_5
commonly
require
for
a
connector_data_1
lake
for
example
requirement_8
aggregation
web
activity
track
and
so
on
m
real
time
handle
technology_1
can
handle
real
time
connector_data_1
pipeline
since
we
need
to
find
a
technology_24
piece
to
handle
real
time
connector_data_4
from
component_5
it
be
one
of
the
core
reason
for
technology_1

disadvantage

con
of
technology_1
–
technology_5
technology_1
disadvantage
it
be
quality_attribute_12
to
kafka’s
limitation
even
if
it
advantage
appear
more
prominent
then
it
disadvantage
however
consider
it
only
when
advantage
be
too
compel
to
omit
here
be
one
more
condition
that
some
disadvantage
might
be
more
relevant
for
a
particular
use
requirement_5
but
not
really
connector_4
to
ours
so
here
we
be
connector_data_2
out
some
of
the
disadvantage
associate
with
technology_1
a
no
complete
set
of
pattern_10
technology_32
it
be
see
that
it
lack
a
full
set
of
requirement_9
and
pattern_10
technology_32
hence
requirement_10
support
staff
felt
anxious
or
fearful
about
choose
technology_1
and
support
it
in
the
long
run
b
issue
with
connector_data_3
tweak
a
we

the
pattern_3
us
certain
component_6
connector_data_5
to
connector_5
connector_data_4
to
the
component_3
however
kafka’s
requirement_11
reduce
significantly
if
the
connector_data_3
need
some
tweak
so
it
can
perform
quite
well
if
the
connector_data_3
be
unchanged
because
it
us
the
capability
of
the
component_6
technology_26
not
support
wildcard
topic
selection
there
be
an
issue
that
technology_1
only
match
the
exact
topic
name
that
mean
it
do
not
support
wildcard
topic
selection
because
that
make
it
incapable
of
connector_6
certain
use
requirement_5
technology_28
lack
of
pace
there
can
be
a
problem
because
of
the
lack
of
pace
while
api’s
which
be
need
by
other
technology_30
be
maintain
by
different
individual
and
corporates
e
reduce
requirement_11
in
general
there
be
no
issue
with
the
individual
connector_data_3
size
however
the
pattern_3
and
component_4
start
compress
these
connector_data_4
a
the
size
increase
due
to
this
when
decompress
the
technology_27
memory
connector_7
slowly
use
also
compress
happen
when
the
connector_data_1
flow
in
the
pipeline
it
affect
quality_attribute_1
and
also
requirement_11
f
behave
clumsy
sometimes
it
start
behave
a
bit
clumsy
and
slow
when
the
number
of
component_7
in
a
technology_1
cluster
increase
g
lack
some
pattern_6
paradigm
some
of
the
pattern_6
paradigm
be
miss
in
technology_1
connector_data_6
connector_data_7
point
to
point
component_7
and
so
on
not
always
but
for
certain
use
requirement_5
it
sound
problematic
so
this
be
all
about
the
advantage
and
disadvantage
of
technology_1
hope
you
our
explanation
conclusion
advantage
and
disadvantage
of
technology_1
hence
we
have
see
all
the
advantage
and
disadvantage
of
technology_1
in
detail
that
will
help
you
a
