that

not
technically
require
to

but
every

will
have
to

about

rather
than

how

topic
for

u
what
you’d
to
see
in
a
follow
up
executable
examplesthe
that
accompany
this
can
be
find
in
the
diy
technology_1
on

example
pattern_3
this
u
a

component_5
gke
cluster
but
technology_2
concept
be
universal
to
follow
along
the
example
connector_2
to
a
technology_2
clusterthe
kubectl
cli
toolthis
assume
that
the
reader
be
familiar
with
kubectl
usage
basic
and
the
technology_4
be
set
up
to
work
with
a
gke
cluster
technology_1
technology_5
imagewe
recommend
use
the
technology_1
technology_5
image
the
image
be
maintain
by
the
technology_5
and
be
build
with
the
late
version
of
technology_1
technology_6
and
technology_7
the
image
have
a
variant
build
with
technology_1
release
candidate
for
early
test
and
adoption
now
let’s
begin
with
the
first
build
block
of
a
technology_1
cluster
run
on
technology_2
pick
a
namespace
to
quality_attribute_1
to
technology_2
namespace
and
permission
rbac
every
set
of
technology_2
connector_data_3
belong
to
a
technology_2
namespace
technology_1
cluster
resource
be
no
exception
we
recommend
use
a
dedicate
namespace
to
keep
the
technology_1
cluster
separate
from
other
component_6
that
be
quality_attribute_1
in
the
technology_2
cluster
have
a
dedicate
namespace
make
logical
sense
and
make
it
easy
to
grant
enough
permission
to
the
cluster
technology_3
this
be
a
quality_attribute_3
quality_attribute_4
practice
rabbitmq’s
technology_2
peer
discovery
plugin
rely
on
the
technology_2
component_7
a
a
connector_data_2
component_8
on
first
boot
every
technology_3
will
try
to
discover
their
peer
use
the
technology_2
component_7
and
attempt
to
join
them
technology_3
that
finish
boot
emit
a
technology_2
to
make
it
easy
to
discover
such

to

connector_2
an
example
namespace
along
with
rbac
rule
can
be
see
in
the
rbac
technology_8
example
if
follow
from
the
example
use
the
follow
command
to
create
a

and
the
require

note
that
this
create

connector_4
test

the
kubectl
example
below
will
use
the

namespace
this
namespace
can
be
set
to
be
the
default
one
for
convenience
alternatively

can
be
append
to
all
kubectl

demonstrate
below
use
a
stateful

require
use
a
stateful
set
to
quality_attribute_1
a

to
technology_2
the
stateful

ensure
that
the
technology_1

be
quality_attribute_1
in
order
one
at
a
time
this
avoid
run
into
a
potential
peer

race
condition
when
quality_attribute_1
a
multi
technology_3
technology_1
cluster
there
be
other
equally
important
reason
for
use
a
stateful
set
instead
of
a
deployment
sticky
identity
quality_attribute_5
requirement_2
identifier
quality_attribute_6
persistent

and
the
ability
to
perform

the

be
pack
with
detail
such
a
mount
configuration
mount
credential
opening
port
etc
which
be
explain
topic
wise
in
the
follow
section
the
final
stateful
set
can
be
find
in
the
under
gke
directory
create
a
component_1
for
cluster
and
cli
toolsthe
stateful
set
definition
can
reference
a
component_1
which
give
the
pod
of
the
stateful
set
their
requirement_2
identity
here
we
be
refer
to
the
v1
statefulset
spec
servicename
property
this
be
require
by
technology_1
for
cluster
and
a
mention
in
the
technology_2
documentation
have
to
be
create
before
the
stateful
set
technology_1
u
port
for
port
for
technology_3
discovery
and
port
for
inter
technology_3
connector_5
since
this
component_1
be
use
internally
and
do
not
need
to
be
connector_6
we
create
a
headless
component_1
it
can
be
find
in
the
example
headless
component_1
technology_8
if
follow
from
the
example
run
the
follow
to
create
a
headless
component_1
for
inter
technology_3
and
cli
technology_4
traffic
the
component_1
now
can
be
observe
in
the
test
technology_1
namespace
use
a
persistent
volume
for
technology_9
datain
order
for
technology_1
technology_3
to
retain
connector_data_2
between
pod
restart
node’s
connector_data_2
directory
must
use
quality_attribute_2
storage
a
persistent
volume
must
be
attach
to
each
technology_1
pod
if
a
transient
volume
be
use
to
back
a
technology_1
technology_3
the
technology_3
will
lose
it
identity
and
all
of
it
local
connector_data_2
in
requirement_4
of
a
restart
this
include
both
schema
and
quality_attribute_2
component_9
connector_data_2
pattern_4
all
of
this
connector_data_2
on
every
technology_3
restart
would
be
highly
inefficient
in
requirement_4
of
a
loss
of
quorum
during
a
roll
restart
this
will
also
lead
to
connector_data_2
loss
in
our
statefulset
technology_8
example
we
create
a
persistent
volume
claim
to
provision
a
persistent
volume
the
persistent
volume
be
mount
at
var
lib
technology_1
mnesia
this
path
be
use
for
a
rabbitmq_mnesia_base
location
the
base
directory
for
all
persistent

of
a
technology_3
a
description
of
default
path
for

can
be
find
in
the
technology_1
documentation
node’s
connector_data_2
directory
base
can
be
connector_7
use
the
rabbitmq_mnesia_base
variable
if
need
make
sure
to
mount
a
persistent

at
the

path
technology_3
pattern_5

the

cookierabbitmq
technology_3
and

a
the
technology_6
to
pattern_6
to
each
other
the
requirement_1
be
a
of
alphanumeric
character
up
to
character
in
size
the
requirement_1
must
be
generate
before
create
a
technology_1
cluster
since
it
be
need
by
the
technology_3
to
form
a
cluster
with
the
technology_5
image
technology_1
technology_3
will
expect
the
to
be
at
var
lib
technology_1
technology_6
we
recommend
create
a
secret
and
mount
it
a
a
volume
on
the
pod
at
this
path
this
be
demonstrate
in
the
statefulset
technology_8
example
the
secret
be
expect
to
have
the
follow
key
requirement_1
pair
to
create
a

runthis
will
create
a

with
a
single

and
the

will
seed
a
default
component_2
with
well
credential
on
first
boot
the
username
and
password
of
this
component_2
be
both
guest
this
default
component_2
can
only
connector_9
from
localhost
by
default
it
be
possible
to
lift
this
restriction
by
opt
in
this
be
useful
for
test
but
very
insecure
instead
an
administrative
component_2
must
be
create
use
generate
credential
the
administrative
component_2
credential
should
be
component_10
in
a
technology_2
secret
and
mount
them
onto
the
technology_1
pod
the
rabbitmq_default_user
and
rabbitmq_default_pass
environment
variable
then
can
be
set
to
the
secret
requirement_1
the
technology_5
image
will
use
them
to
override
default
component_2
credential
example
for
reference
the
secret
be
expect
to
have
the
follow
key
requirement_1
pair
to
create
an
administrative

usethis
will
create
a
secret
with
two
key
component_2
and
pass
take
from
the
name
and
content
a
their
respective
requirement_1
component_2
can
be
create
explicitly
use
cli

a
well
see

doc
section
on
component_2
requirement_5
to
more
technology_3
configurationthere
be
several
way
to
configure
a
technology_1
technology_3
the
recommend
way
be
to
use
configuration
configuration
can
be
express
a
config
connector_data_4
and
mount
a
a
volume
onto
the
technology_1
pod
to
create
a
config
connector_data_4
with
technology_1
configuration
apply
our
minimal
configmap
technology_8
example
use
an
init
containersince
technology_2
config
connector_data_5
be
mount
a
connector_10
only
volume
onto
pod
this
be
problematic
for
the
technology_1
technology_5
image
the
image
can
try
to
update
the
config
at
the
time
of
container
startup
thus
the
path
at
which
the
technology_1
config
be
mount
must
be
connector_10
connector_11
if
a
connector_10
only
be
detected
by
the
technology_5
image
you’ll
see
the
follow
warn
while
the
technology_5
image
do
work
around
the
issue
it
be
not
ideal
to
component_10
the
configuration
in
tmp
and
we
recommend
instead
make
the
mount
path
connector_10
connector_11
a
a
few
other
project
in
the
technology_2
we
use
an
init
container
to
overcome

recommend

it
allow

the

section

to
the

describe

use

the

the

determine
if
a

must

a
with
all

there
be
no
single
solution
that
can
be
recommend
for
all
deployment
health
connector_15
can
produce
false

which
mean
reasonably
healthy
operational
technology_3
will
be
restart
or
even
destroy
and
re
create
for
no
reason
reduce
component_4
quality_attribute_8
moreover
a
technology_1
technology_3

won’t
necessarily
connector_16
the
issue
for
example
restart
a
technology_3
that
be
in
an
alarm
state
because
it
be
low
on
quality_attribute_9
disk
space
won’t
help
all
this
be
to
say
that
liveness
probe
must
be
chosen
wisely
and
with
false
positive
and
“recoverability
by
a
restart”
take
into
account
liveness
probe
also
must
use
technology_3
local
health
connector_15
instead
of
cluster
wide
one
technology_1
cli
technology_4
provide
a
number
of
pre
define
health
connector_15
that
vary
in
how
thorough
they
be
how
intrusive
they
be
and
how
likely
they
be
to
produce
false

in
different
scenario
e
g
when
the

the
connector_15
be
quality_attribute_10
and
can
be
combine
the

choice
be
a

decision
when
in

option
such

give

how
it
go
