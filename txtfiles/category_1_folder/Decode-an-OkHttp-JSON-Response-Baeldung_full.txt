in

we

explore
several
technique
for
decoding
a
technology_1

while
use
okhttp

okhttp
connector_1

be
an

with
feature

handle
of

pattern_2
and
recovery
from
requirement_1
problem
in
spite
of
these
great
feature
okhttp
doesn
t
have
a
build
in
encoder
decoder
for
technology_9
technology_10
and
other
content
type
however
we
can
connector_4
these
with
the
help
of
technology_10
technology_9
bind
technology_11
or
we
can
use
high
level
technology_11
feign
or
technology_12
to
connector_4
our
technology_1
decoder
we
need
to
extract
the
technology_1
from
the
connector_data_2
of
the
component_4
connector_data_3
for
this
we
can
connector_5
the
body
via
the
body
of
the
connector_1
connector_data_4
the
responsebody
have
several
option
for
extract
this
connector_data_1
bytestream
connector_6
the
raw
byte
of
the
body
a
an
inputstream
we
can
use
this
for
all
technology_13
but
usually
it
be
use
for
binary
and
charstream
when
we
have
a
text
connector_1
charstream
wrap
it
inputstream
in
a
reader
and
handle
encoding
accord
to
the
connector_1
s
content
type
or
“utf
8”
if
charset
isn
t
set
in
the
connector_1

however
when
use
charstream
we
can
t
connector_7
the
reader‘s
encoding


the
whole
connector_1
body
a
a

manage
the
encoding
the
same
a
charstream
but
if
we
need
a
different
encoding
we
can
use
component_5
readstring
charset
instead
in
this

we
re
go
to
use

since
our
connector_1
be
small
and
we

t
have
memory
or
requirement_2
concern
the
bytestream
and
charstream
be
quality_attribute_3
choice
in
production

requirement_2
