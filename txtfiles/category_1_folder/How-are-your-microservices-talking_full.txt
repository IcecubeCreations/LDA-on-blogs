at
aivenhere’s
a
quick
history
of
component_1
the
ancient
monolithic
component_2
architecture
provide
everything
from
connector_data_2
component_3
to
component_4
the
enlightenment
pattern_4
architecture
divide
an
component_2
into
a
few
more
or
le
independent
chunk
of
separate
component_5
the
modern
era
pattern_2
architecture
further
divide
component_6
into
their
component_7
part
in
order
to
increase
quality_attribute_1
and
resistance
to
failure
if
you’ve
develop
or
update
any
kind
of
requirement_1
base
component_2
in
the
last
few
year
chance
be
you’ve
do
so
use
a
pattern_2
architecture
rather
than
the
more
date
pattern_4
architecture
so
what’s
the
difference
what
be
pattern_1
pattern_1
be
a
development
where
component_8
be
pattern_5
a
small
loosely
couple
component_5
the
component_6
themselves
be
minimal
atomic
unit
which
together
comprise
the
requirement_2
of
an
entire
component_9
a
pattern_2
do
one
thing
—
only
one
thing
—
and
do
it
well
pattern_1
can
be
think
of
a
minimal
unit
of
requirement_2
can
be
quality_attribute_2
independently
be
quality_attribute_3
and
connector_2
with
each
other
via
various
requirement_3
technology_2
technology_3
more
on
that
in
a
moment
today
most
requirement_1
base
component_8
that
connector_3
a
pattern_6
component_10
be
build
on
pattern_1
or
actually
be
one
themselves
these
architecture
be
connector_4
pattern_2
architecture
benefit
and
challenge
advantage
of
pattern_1
more
granular
component_5
connector_data_3
bring
with
it
enormous
upside
the
isolation
between
pattern_1
mean
that
when
a
single
fail
the
large
component_2
complex
not
even
notice
it
critical
component_11
can
be
build
in
a
highly
quality_attribute_4
way
and
non
critical
one
will
not
bring
down
the
whole
component_12
pattern_1
be
interdependent
in
a
sense
but
they
use
well
define
component_13
instead
of
point
to
point
custom
connector_5
this
bring
unparallelled
quality_attribute_1
for
quality_attribute_5
and
update
replace
individual
pattern_1
be
quicker
and
easy
than
replace
big
chunk
of
your
component_12
at
once
this
allow
you
to
experiment
with
technology_4
and
avoid
connector_6
lock
into
a
tech
technology_5
that
eventually
stop
meet
your
need
during
development
work
with
little
chunk
of
mean
that
you
can
finally
start
reel
in
the
big
benefit
of
continuous
requirement_4
and
deployment
disadvantage
of
pattern_1
but
it’s
not
all
sweetness
and
light
in
pattern_2
land
when
something
break
someone
have
to
comb
through
the
requirement_5
and
lot
of
pattern_1
equal
lot
of
requirement_5
lot
and
lot
of
requirement_5
test
and
deployment
connector_7
more
complicate
a
each
pattern_2
have
to
be
verify
a
functional
individually
and
then
together
this
need
pattern_7
effort
and
proper
component_14
a
a
connector_data_4
small
requirement_6
struggle
to
bring
together
everything
need
to
develop
such
a
highly
granular
component_2
these
be
all
by
and
large
people
challenge
they
can
all
be
conquer
by
increasing
quality_attribute_4
resource
and
coordinate
properly
there
be
however
one
challenge
that
be
primarily
technical
the
need
for
the
pattern_1
to
connector_2
no
pattern_2
can
do
it
without
it
fellow
pattern_1
they’re
quite
people
in
that
regard
and
with
people
connector_8
be
key
you
have
to
do
all
you
can
to
avoid
quality_attribute_6
and
connector_8
disruption
and
your
codebase
have
to
expand
to
accommodate
the
component_14
of
connector_data_5
let’s
next
take
a
look
at
some
connector_8
pattern_8
use
in
pattern_2
implementation
and
how
to
accommodate
them
some
pattern_2
connector_8
pattern_8
in
her
“introduction
to
pattern_1
pattern_9
technology_2
”
sarah
roman
provide
an
excellent
breakdown
of
the
taxonomy
of
connector_8
pattern_8
use
by
and
between
pattern_1
pattern_10
pattern_10
connector_8
be
when
the
sender
of
the
wait
for
component_14
and
some
kind
of
connector_data_6
and
only
then
proceed
to
other
connector_data_7
this
be
typically
connector_9
a
pattern_6
connector_data_8
where
the
sender
submit
a
technology_3
connector_data_5
and
then
the
component_5
component_15
this
and
a
technology_3
connector_10
pattern_10
connector_8
suggest
tight
couple
between
component_5
pattern_11
pattern_11
connector_8
mean
that
a
component_5
doesn’t
need
to
wait
on
another
to
conclude
it
current
connector_data_7
a
sender
doesn’t
necessarily
wait
for
a
connector_10
but
either
pattern_12
for
connector_data_9
late
or
component_16
a
pattern_13
or
action
this
be
typically
do
over
connector_data_1
bus
technology_6
technology_7
and
or
technology_8
pattern_11
connector_8
actually
invoke
loose
couple
between
component_7
component_5
because
there
can
be
no
time
connector_11
between
connector_12
and
a
receiver
act
on
them
single
receiver
in
this
requirement_7
each
connector_data_5
have
one
sender
and
one
receiver
if
there
be
multiple
connector_data_5
they
should
be
stagger
because
a
single
receiver
cannot
connector_13
and
component_14
them
all
at
once
again
this
suggest
tight
couple
between
sender
and
receiver
multiple
receiver
a
the
category
indicate
there
be
multiple
receiver
component_14
multiple
connector_data_5
we
believe
that
while
each
of
these
in
combination
have
their
purpose
within
an
msa
the
most
loosely
couple
arrangement
of
all
be
when
pattern_1
within
a
quality_attribute_7
component_2
connector_2
with
each
other
asynchronously
and
via
multiple
receiver
this
option
imply
that
there
be
no
strict
connector_11
between
sender
time
of
connector_14
technology_2
and
receiver
pattern_3
the
pattern_3
connector_8
be
an
elaboration
on
this
latter
the
sender
merely
connector_15
—
whenever
there
be
to
be
sent—
and
each
receiver
choose
asynchronously
which
to
connector_13
technology_6
technology_7
be
one
of
the
more
recent
evolution
of
pub
sub
technology_6
technology_7
work
by
pass
connector_data_10
via
a
pattern_14
component_17
where
component_11
connector_4
component_18
publish
append
in
time
order
to
quality_attribute_7
requirement_5
connector_4
topic
conceptually
a
category
name
connector_data_2
fee
to
which
component_16
be
append
component_19
be
configure
to
separately
subscribe
from
these
topic
by
offset
the
component_20
number
in
the
topic
this
latter
idea
—
the
notion
that
component_19
simply
decide
what
they
will
connector_16
—
remove
the
complexity
of
have
to
configure
complicate
connector_17
rule
into
the
component_21
or
other
component_11
of
the
component_12
at
the
begin
of
the
pattern_15
when
pattern_11
connector_8
to
multiple
receiver
be
require
technology_6
technology_7
be
a
promise
way
to
go
why
technology_6
technology_7
what
make
technology_6
technology_7
a
quality_attribute_8
connector_8
solution
it
solve
the
problem
of
tight
couple
between
component_11
and
connector_8
be
monitorable
and
facilitate
break
up
large
component_11
into
atomic
granular
independent
quality_attribute_3
component_5
connector_17
rule
configure
by
component_22
when
the
connector_17
rule
be
configure
by
component_22
a
feature
of
pattern_3
and
technology_6
technology_7
generally
there
be
no
need
to
build
additional
complexity
into
the
connector_data_2
pattern_15
itself
this
decouple
component_11
from
the
connector_data_1
bus
and
each
other
and
you
develop
and
test
them
independently
without
worry
about
connector_11
build
in
support
for
pattern_11
pattern_9
all
of
the
above
make
it
reasonably
quality_attribute_9
to
decouple
component_7
and
focus
on
a
specific
part
of
the
component_2
pattern_11
connector_data_1
when
use
correctly
remove

another
point
of
complexity
by
your

be
ready
for
without
be
pattern_16
to
them
high
quality_attribute_10
low
quality_attribute_6
it’s
easy
to
have
peace
of
mind
about
break
up
large
component_6
into
small
more
atomic
one
when
you
don’t
have

about
