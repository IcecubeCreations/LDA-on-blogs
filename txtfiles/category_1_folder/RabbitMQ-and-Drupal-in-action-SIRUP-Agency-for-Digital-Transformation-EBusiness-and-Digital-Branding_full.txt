a

to

where
they

the
distinctive
feature
here
be
the
way
in
which
the

be

quality_attribute_2
in

component_8
connector_9
connector_10
connector_data_3
be

if
necessary
connector_8
at

if
an

additionally
the

doesn

determine

–
this
be
do
by

base
on
predefined
rule
this
connector_data_4
in
a
quality_attribute_3
and
quality_attribute_4
pattern_2
of
connector_11
for
the
component_7
furthermore
connector_data_2
pattern_1
can
be
use
in
a
target
fashion
to
achieve
highly
quality_attribute_5
component_1
or
to
cushion
peak
in

connector_data_3
be
then
quality_attribute_2
evenly
across

connector_12
component_5
to
achieve
load
balance
at
the
same
time
the
component_9
allow
the
component_5
to
define
the
component_8
quality_attribute_6
themselves
an
component_7
can
therefore
continue
to
run
stably
while

be
both

the

can

only

this

it

the

solve
the
problem
of
duplicate
connector_data_2
or
rather
ensure
that
the

of
a

have
no
further
effect
if
for
example
a

duplicate
connector_data_3
can

then

the

such
a

work
with

the
idempotent
implementation
offer
a
quality_attribute_10
and
more
elegant
solution
here
the
second
rule
s
connector_data_11
be
to
ensure
that
outdated
connector_data_3
do
not
overwrite
any
connector_data_1
to
do
this
it
be
necessary
to
find
a
separate
criterion
at
component_7
level
that
can
determine
the
order
of
the
connector_data_2
in
the
quality_attribute_10
requirement_7
this
would
be
a
pattern_8
of
the
component_17
time
synchronize
a
well
a
possible
the
connector_12
component_7
constantly
connector_24
this
criterion
somewhere
and
compare
it
before
component_8
a
connector_data_2
if
a
version
exist
the
connector_data_2
be
ignore
a
typical
component_7
be
the
alignment
of
component_15
connector_data_1
across
several
component_4
–
here
the
date
of
the
last
connector_data_2
or
connector_25
for
every
component_15
could
be
component_18
rule
number
three
ensure
that
the
component_9
be
not
swamp
by
invalid
connector_data_3
that
be
connector_16
over
and
over
again
because
component_8
be
fail
this
be
where
the
developer
come
in
–
they
have
to
connector_26
the
connector_data_2
content
carefully
before
it
be
component_8
a
when
an
error
have
already
occur
it
be
difficult
to
then
recognize
whether
this
be
due
to
the
connector_data_2
or
a
temporary
error
in
the
component_7
in
the
latter
requirement_7
the
connector_data_2
component_8
should
not
be
confirm
to
ensure
that
the
connector_data_2
be
automatically
connector_16
again
late
the
component_7
then
have
another
chance
to
component_8
the
connector_data_2
find
the
component_19
of
an
error
–
connector_data_2
or
component_7
–
be
therefore
very
important
a
handle
the
respective
connector_data_2
differ
fundamentally
quality_attribute_9
on
the
component_19
of
the
error
the
final
rule
–
it
crash
–
be
important
a
connector_data_3
cannot
be
connector_7
a
part
of
a
normal
technology_16
connector_data_5
a
a
long
run
component_8
be
necessary
for
the
timely
component_8
of
connector_data_2
which
require
constant
with
technology_1
this
be
no
long
a
problem
in
technology_18
thanks
to
the
addition
of
a
functional
garbage
collection
with
technology_18
thus
memory
usage
do
not
grow
immeasurably
or
connector_27
the
memory
limit
over
time
nevertheless
you
should
still
expect
fatal
error
that
cannot
be
resolve
and
which
knock
the
component_8
out
of
pattern_9
it
be
therefore
often
the
best
and
above
all
quality_attribute_10
strategy
to
pattern_10
the
component_8
and
if
necessary
restart
it
automatically

be
not

when

the

enable
the

be

in
the
component_22
of
technology_2
the
command
line
technology_22
drush
be
the
perfect
solution
a
it
take
care
of
the
bootstrapping
of
the
cm
and
the
requirement_9
of
the
console
environment
the
connector_data_2
pattern_1
hook
in
there
and
can
be
start
use
the

connector_33
technology_11
connector_data_2
command
it
then
connector_34
to
technology_1
and
component_6
connector_data_3
for

it
be
also
possible

specify

that
optimize
the
connector_3
with

when
connector_35
the
technology_2
however
you
will
notice
from
time
to
time
that
the
cm
be
not
necessarily
design
for
such
a
situation
for
example
the
watchdog
u
a
one
time
initialize
constant
a
the
current
time
when
requirement_10
therefore
all
of
the
drush
component_8
s
requirement_10
entry
late
appear
a
if
they
have
be
make
at
the
start
time
of
the
component_8
this
be
annoying
in
itself
but
there
s
another
reason
why
it
s
worthwhile
to
adapt
technology_2
s
requirement_10
the
default
set
be
connector_36
to
the
component_16
if
the
technology_17
connector_18

terminate
unexpectedly
you
win
t
hear
anything
about
it
requirement_10
in
a
be
therefore
a
lot
more
quality_attribute_3
–
e
g
via
technology_2
s
syslog
another
quirk
of
some
such
a
node_load
be
the
use
of
an
internal
pattern_14
in
the
form
of
statistical
variable
it
be
design
to
prevent
the
re
connector_31
of
technology_17
connector_37
–
but
can
be
dangerous
when
several
concurrent
drush
component_6
be
be
use
it
can
easily
happen
that
your
continue
to
work
with
a
now
obsolete
technology_23
connector_data_14
and
then
connector_36
overwrite
it
in
the
component_16
it
s
quality_attribute_1
to
connector_data_8
node_load
and
similar
with
the
parameter
reset=true
so
that
the
pattern_14
be
deactivate
component_23
applicationsnot
every
piece
of
can
be
equipped
directly
with
an
to
the
connector_data_2
pattern_1
third
party
or
component_23
component_5
need
to
be
bind
via
a
pattern_15
gateway
this
pattern_16
the
world
of
the
connector_data_3
into
the
technology_24
of
the
component_7
the
component_8
of
connector_data_3
be
therefore
a
matter
of
delegation
preferably
to
a
quality_attribute_13
a
can
be
find
in
many
technology_12
quality_attribute_9
on
the
scope
and
in
completeness
of
the
the
gateway
can
then
also
be
more
complex
it
be
often
necessary
to
query
the
technology_12
component_24
regularly
to
respond
to
a
suitable
cronjob
must
then
ensure
that
order
be
query
at
interval
of
say
minute
and
that
the
appropriate
connector_data_3
be
connector_5
to
connector_32
the
second
rule
the
date
of
the
last
connector_25
for
all
datasets
must
also
be
connector_2
if
the
do
not
allow
for
this
the
gateway
itself
need
it
own
component_16
summarythe
transition
to
pattern_5
connector_data_2
delivery
bring
with
it
connector_14
that
require
approach
and
solution
a
rethink
be
require
not
only
in
term
of
component_3
design
but
also
in
the
implementation
so
that
the
benefit
of
the
connector_data_2
pattern_1
end
up
be
reflect
in
the
finish
quality
requirement
such
quality_attribute_14
and
quality_attribute_15
be
now
easy
to
realize
thanks
to
the

the

also

in
the
construction
of
a

the

the
