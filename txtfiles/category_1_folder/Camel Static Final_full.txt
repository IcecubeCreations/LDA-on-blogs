the

i
literally
spend

deconstruct

piece

then
remember
something
about

in

requirement_6
on

so
the

need
a

stay
up

the

also

please
a
it

both

already
have
the

in

in

to

it
seem
a
natural

instead
of
use

component_19
in

office
we
make

to
facilitate

between

the
great
thing
about
technology_1
be
that
it
provide
an
abstraction
pattern_9
for
the
actual
connector_23
mechanism
between
component_19
since
the

be
not

together
we

transfer
the

from

to
the

pattern_1
component_19
in

we
could
move
the

to

component_12

technology_5
simply
by
connector_18
a

with
no

there

it

with

configuration

be

the

the
final
step
be
to
create
a
configuration
in
the
jar’s
meta
inf
directory
which
will
allow
the
technology_1
component_4
to
find
and
load
the
custom
component_13
the
convention
be
to
put
a
name
component_13
name
“siesta”
in
our
requirement_3
in
the
meta
inf
component_2

technology_1
component_13

of
the

the
meta

siesta
contain
line
to
tell
the

component_4
which
to
load

lynden
siesta
component_13
siestacomponent
that’s
it
with
relatively
quality_attribute_2
and
a
small
config
we
be
able
to
easily
connector_1

rterp
leave
a
i’ve
from
the
camelone
open_source
requirement_4
conference
in
boston
where
i
be
invite
a
a
speaker
to
present
how
lynden
be
use
technology_4
a
part
of
it
freight
track
infrastructure
a
expect
there
be
a
number
of
big
announcement
and
very
interest
project
that
speaker
from
all
over
the
world
showcased
during
the
day
conference
here
be
few
project
component_19
that
i
find
be
useful
here
at
lynden
in
particular
i
think
this
be
by
far
the
most
interest
project
announce
during
the
conference
fuse
technology_25
be
a
quality_attribute_4
configuration
requirement_12
and
provision
component_9
for
fuse
esb
fuse
connector_data_2
pattern_5
and
the
technology_3
open_source
requirement_4
solution
technology_26
technology_1
technology_27
karaf
&
servicemix
basically
provide
a
single
point
where
configuration
connector_data_6
for
pattern_5
and
other
component_19
can
go
to
connector_21
their
config
info
under
the
cover
it
be
make
use
of
technology_3
technology_28
to
component_28
the
cluster
configuration
and
technology_29
registration
we
be
currently
only
run
production
connector_data_2
pattern_5
but
we
have
connector_data_2
pattern_5
in
our
test
environment
fuse
technology_25
could
greatly
reduce
the
overhead
of
manage
the
configuration
of
those
pattern_5
technology_3
technology_28
a
it
seem
at
these
conference
there
be
always
idea
fly
around
among
the
attendee
and
i
always
seem
to
obtain
a
many
idea
attend
component_30
a
i
do
talk
to
other
architect
and
developer
outside
the
component_29
i
be
explain
to
someone
the
challenge
we
have
with
manage
the
configuration
of
our
70+
web
component_1
and
component_12
in
our
production
stag
and
test
environment
his
immediate
connector_2
be
to
take
a
look
at
technology_3
technology_28
they
have
be
use
it
the
past
few
month
for
manage
configuration
of
multiple
environment
with
quality_attribute_5
success
a
mention
above
fuse
technology_25
make
use
of
technology_3
technology_28
and
i’m
curious
to
if
technology_25
can
be
use
beyond
the
requirement_4
component_31
it
mention
esb
mq
etc
and
also
use
for

such
