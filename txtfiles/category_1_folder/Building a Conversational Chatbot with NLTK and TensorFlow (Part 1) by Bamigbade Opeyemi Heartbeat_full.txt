first
we
need
to

splittingtext
pre

can
be
really
challenge
but
in
order
to
avoid
connector_8
all
from

we
can
frame
the

with
a

dataframe
with
the

can

kdnuggets
comremoving
stop

also
quality_attribute_2
practice
to
remove
stop
word
from
connector_data_10
so
a
to
avoid
mislead
the
component_10
stop
word
be
word
that
do
not
contribute
to
the
deep
mean
of
the

and
indefinite

pronoun
and
conjunction
to
mention
a
few
with
the
technology_1
technology_8
pattern_4
out
stop
word
be
easy
and
you
can
also
word
that
you
feel
should
be
a
stop
word
into
the
predefined
set
of
word
in
the
technology_8
the
snippet
below
will
out
the

use
the

technology_8
from

stop_words
remove
stop

and
connector_10
the
connector_data_10
with
joblib

buildingonce
we
remove
the
stop
word
the
text
be
become
clean
and
at
least
halfway
ready
for
component_10
our
next
step
be
to
build
a
vocabulary
which
be
a
set
of
word
in
a
give
dataset
after
the
removal
of
stop
word
this
will
come
in
very
handy
during
connector_data_2
encoding

to
create
word
vocabularyencoding
and
decodingnow
that
we
have
a
vocabulary
of
word
in
the
dataset
each
of
the
pattern_3
can
be
encode
into
numerical
feature
for
component_10
use
any
of
the
common
text
encoding
techniques—count
vectorizer
term
frequency
inverse
document
frequency
tf
idf
hash
etc
use
technology_2
kera
text_to_sequence
we
can
encode
each
pattern_3
corpus
to
vectorize
a
text
corpus
by
turn
each
text
into
either
a
sequence
of

each
be
the
index
of
a
connector_data_10
in
a
dictionary
or
into
a
vector
where
the
coefficient
for
each
connector_data_10
could
be
binary
base
on
word
count
which
be
base
on
tf
idf
the
connector_data_9
vector
will
be

pad
with
zero
so
a
to
equal
the
length
of
the
vector
encoding
functiondata
splittingwith
the
connector_data_2
encode
we
can
now
split
it
into
train
and
test
set
the
train
set
will
be
use
to
train
the
component_10
while
the
test
set
will
be
use
for
evaluate
it
requirement_11
on
unseen
connector_data_2
this
can
be
do
use
a

most
common
approach
to

be
a

represent
text
in
which
each

in
the

be
represent
by
a
real
requirement_12
vector
in
a

these
vector
be

in
such
a
way
that
word
that
have

will
have

this
have

prove

these
