that

want
to
connector_1
the

or
a
a

that
make

what
if
i
tell

that
this
doesn

have
to

if
i
tell
you
that
technology_2
s
and
technology_9
connector_data_1
technology_5
s
advance
feature
and
their
side
effect
be
the
key
to

that
it
help
you
to
be
appreciate
by
your
manager
and
team
member
a
a
true
expert
and
at
the
same
time
allow
you
to
spend
your
evening
and
weekend
with
your
friend
and
family
i
that
might
sound
a
little
too
quality_attribute_3
to
be
true
but
it
isn
t
with
connector_4
to
the
right
resource
and
a
supportive
of

developer
you
will
connector_1
there
how
i
to
do
it
the
right
wayi
be
in
the
same
situation
i
copy
snippet
from
technology_8
overflow
and
only
to
find
that
they
didn
t
work
in
my
project
or
cause
other
problem
not
mention
in
the
the
situation
be
frustrate
and
i
recognize
that
this
approach
wasn
t
work
you
need
to
really
understand
the
technology_10
with
their
complex
feature
and
side
effect
so
that
you
can
choose
the
right
approach
for
your
component_3
otherwise
each
decision
come
down
to
pure
luck
to
make
it
even
bad
you
often
need
to
wait
for
your
component_1
to
use
your
connector_5
before
you
if
you
make
the
right
decision
or
whether
it
cause
side

people
who

really
work
and
what
s
happen
internally
so
that
i
be
able
to
use
them
correctly
instead
of

i
start

start
to
form
a

one
in
which
the

begin
to
work
together
and
in
which
the
subtle
i
find
in

should
also
have
build
a
few
persistence
pattern_1
with
technology_2
and
quality_attribute_9
them
to
production
technology_9
connector_data_1
jpathis
be
for
you
if
you
re
use
technology_9
connector_data_1
technology_5
to
connector_3
your
persistence
pattern_1
you
will
to
configure
technology_9
connector_data_1
technology_5
use
it
technology_13
pattern_7
and
test
your
persistence
pattern_1
i
will
also
show
you
how
to
avoid
requirement_3
problem
extend
technology_9
s
pattern_7
with
and
without
connector_18
your
own
and
give
you
an
introduction
to
several
requirement_8
of
other
technology_10
to
provide
audit
create
more
complex
query
migrate
your
component_14
and
much
more
to
connector_1
the
most
out
of
this
you
should
at
least
be
familiar
with
technology_5
s
basic
concept
connector_data_1
and
query
feature
connector_data_1
and
connector_15
pattern_4
for
microservicesthis
be
for
you
if
you
want
to
design
a
pattern_2
architecture
for
your
component_3
and
wonder
how
these
component_15
will
connector_19
unfortunately
that
s
not
a
easy
a
some
conference
speaker
want
to
make
you
believe
i
will
explain
why
most
of
the
concept
use
in
a
monolith
no
long
work
in
a
pattern_2
architecture
you
will
pattern_4
to
avoid
quality_attribute_10
connector_6
or
if
that
s
not
possible
to
at
least
make
them
a
resilient
a
possible
i
will
also
show
you
how
to
design
quality_attribute_10
connector_20
that
ensure
connector_data_1
consistency
without
require
any
lock
or
cause
other
quality_attribute_11
issue
to
connector_1
the
most
out
of
this
you
should
have
a
basic
understand
of
technology_9
and
some
experience
in
component_4
design
can
i
connector_1
one
on
one
help
and
support
for
my
project
you
can
not
only
your
question
in
the
forum
but
also
join
the
monthly
live
q&a
connector_data_6
for
these
connector_data_6
you
can
either
pre
submit
your
question
for
thorben
or
ask
it
live
what
if
i

we
that
you
