golden

for

component_1
designweb
component_2
and
their
component_3
abound
unfortunately
the
vast
majority
be
difficult
to
use
reason
range
from
poor
design
to
lack
of
documentation
to
volatility
to
unresolved
bug
or
in
some
requirement_1
all
of
the
above
follow
the
guidance
in
this
to
help
ensure
that
your

be
clean
well
document
and
easy
to
use
such
component_3
be
truly
rare
and
be
therefore
much
more

to

find
yourself
wonder
“what
be
they
think
”
when
quality_attribute_1
a
web
component_4
via
it
technology_1
if
not
you’ve
be
far
lucky
than
i
have
any
developer
how
easy
it
be
to
a
project
devolve
into
spaghetti
and
web
component_3
be
no
le
prone
to
connector_data_1
in
a
tangle
web
but
it
doesn’t
need
to
be
that
way
in
truth
it’s
possible
to
design
great
web
component_3
that
people
will
actually
enjoy
use
and
that
you’ll
enjoy
create
a
well
but
how
the
answer
to
that
question
be
what
this
be
all
about
perspective
most
of
the
time
when
you’re
build
solution
you’re
design
for
end
component_5
who
be
not
programmer
or
who
be
generally
not
technically
sophisticate
you’re
give
them
a
graphical
and
if
you’ve
be
do
your
right
you’ve
glean
a
pretty
quality_attribute_2
idea
from
them
of
what
they
need
the
to
do
but
component_1
development
be
different
you’re
design
an
for
programmer
probably
without
even
who
they
be
and
whoever
they
be
they
will
have
the
technical
sophistication
or
at
least
will
think
they
have
the
technical
sophistication
to
point
out
every
little
flaw
in
your
your
component_5
be
likely
to
be
a
critical
of
your
component_1
a
you
would
be
of
theirs
and
will
thoroughly
enjoy
critique
it
and
therein
lie
part
of
the
irony
by
the
way
if
anyone
should
understand
how
to
make
a
web
component_1
that’s
easy
to
use
it’s
you
after
all
you’re
a
engineer
the
component_5
of
your
technology_1
so
you
connector_1
their
perspective
don’t
you
well
while
you
certainly
understand
their
perspective
you
don’t
necessarily
connector_1
their
perspective
when
you’re
develop
or
enhance
your
technology_1
you
have
the
perspective
of
an
component_1
designer
whereas
they
have
the
perspective
of
an
component_1
component_6
component_1
designer
typically
focus
on
question
“what
do
this
component_4
need
to
do
”
or
“what
do
this
component_4
need
to
provide
”
while
component_1
component_5
be
focus
on
“how
can
i
use
this
component_1
to
do
what
i
need
”
or
more
accurately
“how
can
i
spend
the
bare
minimum
of
effort
to
connector_2
what
i
need
out
of
this
technology_1
”
these
different
question
lead
to
two
vastly
different
perspective
a
a
connector_data_1
the
necessary
prerequisite
to
design
a
great
component_1
be
to
shift
your
perspective
from
that
of
the
component_1
designer
to
that
of
the
component_1
component_6
in
other
word
continually
ask
yourself
the
question
you
would
naturally
ask
if
you
be
your
own
component_6
rather
than
think
about
what
your
component_1
can
do
think
about
the
different
way
it
need
or
want
to
be
use
and
then
focus
on
make
those
connector_data_2
a
easy
a
possible
for
your
api’s
component_6
while
this
sound
easy
and
obvious
it’s
astound
how
infrequently
component_3
appear
to
be
design
this
way
think
about
the
component_3
you’ve
encounter
in
your
career
how
frequently
do
they
appear
to
have
be
design
with
this
perspective
in
mind
web
component_1
design
can
be
challenge
so
with
that
say
let’s
proceed
and
talk
about
the
golden
rule
for
design
a
great
web
technology_1
namely
documentation
quality_attribute_3
and
consistency
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_5
ease
of
adoption
relate
thing
you
have
never
do
with
a
pattern_1
specification
rule
documentation
documentation
yes
i’m
start
here
do
you
hate
documentation
well
i
can
empathize
but
put
on
your
“user
perspective”
hat
and
i’ll
bet
that
the
one
thing
you
hate
more
than
have
to
connector_3
documentation
be
have
to
try
to
use
an
undocumented
technology_1
i
rest
my
requirement_1
the
bottom
line
be
that
if
you
want
anyone
to
use
your
technology_1
documentation
be
essential
you’ve
simply
connector_2
to
connector_2
this
right
it’s
the
first
thing
component_5
will
see
so
in
some
way
it’s
the
gift
wrap
present
well
and
people
be
more
likely
to
use
your
component_1
and
put
up
with
any
idiosyncrasy
so
how
do
we
connector_3
quality_attribute_2
documentation
the
relatively
easy
part
be
document
the
component_1
themselves
i
e
example
connector_data_3
and
connector_4
along
with
description
of
each
of
the
element
in
both
fortunately
there
be
an
increasing
number
of
technology_2
that
facilitate
and
simplify
the
connector_data_4
of
generate
documentation
or
you
can
connector_3
something
yourself
that
introspect
your
technology_1
and
and
generate
the
correspond
documentation
for
you
but
what
separate
great
documentation
from
adequate
documentation
be
the
inclusion
of
usage
example
and
ideally
this
be
what
help
the
component_6
understand
your
component_1
and
where
to
start
it
orient
them
and
help
them
load
your
component_1
into
their
brain
for
example
if
the
developer
of
technology_3
be
to
connector_data_5
out
every
every
and
every
possible
connector_4
to
their
technology_1
but
didn’t
bother
to
mention
that
you
can
connector_5
an
sm
track
a
connector_data_6
or
buy
a
phone
number
through
their
technology_1
it
would
take
a
really
long
time
for
the
component_1
component_6
to
find
that
connector_data_7
and
understand
it
cohesively
can
you
imagine
sorting
through
a
giant
tree
of
and
without
any
insight
into
what
they
be
use
for
other
than
their
name
sound
terrible
right
but
that’s
exactly
what
so
many
component_1
technology_4
do
thereby
leave
their
component_3
opaque
to
anybody
but
themselves
the
rackspace
cloudfiles
developer
and
component_1
guide
be
one
such
example
it’s
difficult
to
connector_2
your
bear
unless
you
already
understand
what
they’re
do
and
what
they’re
provide
so
connector_3
concise
that
help
connector_2
the
developer
up
and
run
quickly
with
at
least
a
skeleton
of
what
they’re
try
to
do
and
then
point
them
in
the
direction
of
the
more
detail
fully
document
connector_data_5
of
requirement_2
so
they
can
expand
on
what
they
have
once
you’re
do
with
your
documentation
be
sure
to
validate
that
it
make
sense
to
people
other
than
yourself
connector_5
it
out
to
other
developer
in
your
requirement_3
give
them
no
instruction
other
than
point
them
to
the
documentation
and
ask
them
to
follow
a
or
build
something
really
basic
in
about
minute
if
they
can’t
have
a
basic
requirement_4
with
your
component_1
in
minute
you
have
more
work
to
do
for
some
noteworthy
example
of
excellent
and
detail
documentation
connector_6
out
technology_3
technology_5
and
mailchimp
none
of
these
technology_6
be
necessarily
the
best
in
their
requirement_5
although
they
be
all
quality_attribute_2
technology_6
yet
they
do
distinguish
themeselves
by
provide
some
of
the
best
documentation
within
their
requirement_5
which
have
certainly
facilitate
their
wide
acceptance
and
requirement_5
connector_1
rule
quality_attribute_3
and
consistency
if
you’ve
ever
use
facebook’s
technology_1
you
how
often
they
deprecate
and
completely
rewrite
their
apis
no
matter
how
much
you
respect
their
hacker
culture
or
their
technology_6
theirs
be
not
a
developer
friendly
perspective
the
reason
they
be
still
successful
be
because
they
have
a
billion
component_6
not
because
their
component_1
be
great
but
you
probably
don’t
have
the
luxury
of
such
a
mammoth
component_6
base
and
requirement_5
connector_1
so
you’re
go
to
need
have
a
much
le
volatile
technology_1
keep
old
version
run
and
support
for
quite
a
long
period
of
time
maybe
even
year
so
toward
that
end
here
be
some
tip
and
trick
let’s
say
for
example
that
your
component_1
be
quality_attribute_6
via
the
url
technology_7
myapisite
technology_8
technology_1
widget
and
provide
it
connector_4
in
technology_9
technology_10
while
this
seem
fine
at
first
blush
what
happen
when
you
need
to
modify
the
technology_10
of
the
technology_9
connector_4
everyone
that’s
already
quality_attribute_1
with
you
be
go
to
break
oops
so
do
some
plan
ahead
and
version
your
component_1
from
the
outset
explicitly
incorporate
a
version
number
into
the
url
e
g
technology_7
myapisite
technology_8
technology_1
widget
version=1
or
technology_7
myapisite
technology_8
technology_1
widget
v1
so
that
people
can
rely
on
version
work
and
can
upgrade
to
any
subsequent
version
when
they’re
ready
to
do
so
if
you
need
to
phase
out
a
prior
version
at
some
point
go
ahead
but
give
plenty
of
notice
and
offer
some
sort
of
transition
plan
a
quality_attribute_2
url
technology_11
will
include
major
version
in
the
url
any
connector_7
to
the
output
technology_10
or
support
connector_data_8
type
should
connector_data_1
in
bump
up
to
a
major
version
generally
it’s
acceptable
to
keep
the
same
version
if
all
you
be
do
be
key
or
technology_12
to
your
output
but
to
be
on
the
quality_attribute_7
side
any
time
the
output
connector_7
bump
a
version
in
addition
to
be
quality_attribute_8
over
time
component_3
need
to
be
internally
consistent
i’ve
see
many
component_3
that
connector_7
parameter
name
or
of
connector_data_8
quality_attribute_9
on
the
that
be
be
use
instead
you
should
handle
common
parameter
globally
within
your
component_1
and
use
inheritance
or
a
connector_8
architecture
to
quality_attribute_10
the
same
name
convention
and
connector_data_8
handle
consistently
throughout
your
technology_1
finally
you
need
to
component_7
and
publish
a
changelog
to
show
difference
between
version
of
your
component_1
so
that
component_5
exactly
how
to
upgrade
relate
grape
gem
how
to
build
a
rest
component_1
in
technology_13
rule
quality_attribute_4
garbage
in
garbage
out
gigo
be
a
well
mantra
to
most
programmer
a
apply
to
web
component_1
design
this
guide
principle
tend
to
dictate
a
fairly
rigid
approach
to
connector_data_9
validation
sound
great
right
no
mess
no
problem
yet
a
with
everything
there
need
to
be
some
balance
a
it
be
not
possible
to
anticipate
every
way
that
component_5
will
want
to
employ
your
component_4
and
since
not
every
component_8
component_9
be
consistent
i
e
not
every
component_9
have
very
quality_attribute_2
technology_9
support
a
decent
oauth
technology_14
etc
it’s
quality_attribute_2
to
have
at
least
some
degree
of
quality_attribute_4
or
tolerance
with
regard
to
your
input
and
output
constraint
for
example
many
component_3
will
support
a
variety
of
output
technology_10
technology_15
technology_16
technology_17
et
al
but
will
only
support
specify
the
technology_10
in
the
url
itself
in
the
spirit
of
remain
quality_attribute_11
you
could
allow
this
to
also
be
specify
in
the
url
e
g
technology_1
v1
widget
technology_15
or
you
might
also
connector_9
and
recognize
an
connector_10
component_10
technology_15
technology_7
or
support
a
querystring
variable
such
a
format=json
and
so
on
and
while
we’re
at
it
why
not
allow
for
the
technology_10
specify
to
be
requirement_1
insensitive
so
the
component_6
could
specify
format=json
a
well
that’s
a
classic
example
of
a
way
to
alleviate
unnecessary
frustration
for
the
component_6
of
your
technology_1
another
example
be
allow
for
different
way
of
inputting
variable
so
you
have
a
variety
of
output
technology_10
allow
for
a
variety
of
input
technology_10
a
well
e
g
plain
variable
technology_15
technology_17
etc
you
should
at
least
be
support
technology_18
variable
and
many
modern
component_11
support
technology_9
a
well
so
those
two
be
a
quality_attribute_2
place
to
start
the
point
here
be
that
you
shouldn’t
assume
that
everyone
connector_11
your
technical
preference
with
a
little
research
into
how
other
component_3
work
and
through
dialog
with
other
developer
you
can
glean
other
valuable
alternative
that
be
useful
and
include
them
in
your
technology_1
rule
quality_attribute_5
quality_attribute_5
be
obviously
one
of
the
most
important
thing
to
build
into
your
web
component_4
but
so
many
developer
make
it
ridiculously
hard
to
use
a
the
component_1
technology_4
you
should
be
offer
quality_attribute_12
example
of
how
to
pattern_2
and
pattern_3
when
connector_12
your
technology_1
this
should
not
be
a
difficult
issue
that
an
end
component_6
spend
hour
work
on
make
it
your
goal
that
they
either
don’t
have
to
connector_3
any
or
it
take
them
le
than
minute
to
connector_3
it
for
most
apis
i
prefer
a
quality_attribute_13
connector_data_10
base
pattern_4
where
the
connector_data_10
be
a
random
hash
assign
to
the
component_6
and
they
can
reset
it
at
any
point
if
it
have
be
steal
allow
the
connector_data_10
to
be
pass
in
through
or
an
technology_7
for
example
the
component_6
could
and
should
connector_5
an
sha
connector_data_10
a
a
variable
or
a
a
in
a
technology_10
such
a
“authorization
da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709”
also
choose
a
quality_attribute_14
connector_data_10
not
a
short
numeric
identifier
something
irreversible
be
best
for
example
it’s
relatively
quality_attribute_13
to
generate
out
an
sha
connector_data_10
during
component_6
creation
and
component_12
it
in
the
component_13
then
you
can
simply
query
your
component_13
for
any
component_5
match
that
connector_data_10
you
could
also
do
a
connector_data_10
generate
with
a
unique
identifier
and
a
salt
requirement_6
something
sha
component_6
+
abcd123
and
then
query
for
any
component_6
that
match
e
g
where
tokenfrompost
=
sha
component_6
+
abcd123
another
very
quality_attribute_2
option
be
oauth
+
technology_19
you
should
be
use
technology_19
anyway
but
oauth
be
reasonably
quality_attribute_13
to
connector_13
on
the
component_14
side
and
technology_14
be
quality_attribute_15
for
many
common
programming
technology_20
if
the
component_1
you
have
make
be
suppose
to
be
quality_attribute_6
on
a
via
technology_21
you
need
to
also
make
sure
you
validate
a
connector_data_5
of
url
per
account
for
the
connector_data_10
that
way
nobody
can
go
inspect
the
connector_data_11
to
your
technology_1
steal
the
connector_data_10
from
your
component_6
and
go
use
it
for
themselves
here
be
some
other
important
thing
to
keep
in
mind
whitelisting
requirement_2
component_3
generally
allow
you
to
do
basic
create
connector_9
update
and
delete
on
connector_data_8
but
you
don’t
want
to
allow
these
for
every
component_15
so
make
sure
each
have
a
whitelist
of
allowable
action
make
sure
for
example
that
only
pattern_3
component_5
can
run
command
component_6
delete
similarly
all
useful
that
be
connector_14
in
the
user’s
connector_data_9
need
to
be
validate
against
a
whitelist
a
well
if
you
be
allow
content
type
verify
that
whatever
the
component_6
connector_15
in
actually
match
a
whilelist
of
support
content
type
if
it
doesn’t
then
connector_5
back
an
error
connector_data_12
such
a
a
not
acceptable
connector_4
whitelisting
be
important
a
a
lot
of
component_3
be
automatically
generate
or
use
a
blacklist
instead
which
mean
you
have
to
be
explicit
about
what
you
don’t
want
however
the
golden
rule
of
quality_attribute_5
be

validate

in

you

allow

if

this
be
really
the
most

rule
in

bunch
and
build
on
all
the
others
a
i
mention
during

rule
try
this
out
with

that

make

here
be
some

of

make
sure
people
can
actually
use
your

and
that
it
work
the

time
every
time
have
people
try
to
connector_13
your

occasionally
to
verify
that
it’s
not

way
that
you’ve
become

don’t
do

crazy
custom

technology_11
don’t
reinvent
technology_22
or
technology_15
or
rest
or
anything
use
all
the
technology_2
you
can
that
have
already
be
connector_13
and
be
widely
connector_10
so
that
developer
only
have
to
your
technology_1
not
your
component_1
+
obscure
technology_23
provide
technology_20
specific
technology_14
to
with
your
component_4
there
be
some
nice
technology_2
to
automatically
generate
a

ron
pedro
werneckwhat
concern
me
the
most
be
that
component_1
versioning
be
present
a
a
rule
for
consistency
and
quality_attribute_3
while
it
imply
the
exact
opposite
when
you
put
a
version
number
in
the
uri
you
re
imply
that
you
will
break
consistency
and
backwards
quality_attribute_16
at
some
point
component_1
versioning
should
be
the
last
resort
to
deal
with
issue
involve
long
term
evolution
and
backwards
quality_attribute_16
not
the
first
the
web
itself
isn
t
versioned
why
web
component_3
should
be
it
be
use
to
ease
component_14
side
implementation
but
not
to
drive
connector_17
with
component_8
for
long
term
evolution
it
s
much
quality_attribute_2
to
the
component_1
itself
provide
uris
and
them
drive
the
connector_17
and
documentation
should
reflect
that
the
example
give
put
too
much
effort
on
describe
uris
while
they
should
describe
connector_20
relation
and
keep
uri
semantics
quality_attribute_17
you
t
care
about
the
semantics
of
an
uri
when
you
click
on
a
connector_20
you
only
care
what
the
relationship
be
where
it
connector_21
you
to
also
it
suggest
component_1
versioning
a
a
solution
for
connector_7
technology_10
and
connector_data_8
type
but
that
should
be
do
by
versioning
the
type
itself
which
bring
u
to
the
rule
about
quality_attribute_4
it
consider
append
a
extension
or
query
parameter
to
the
uri
on
par
with
the
connector_10
while
the
latter
be
a
lot
more
rich
and
quality_attribute_11
by
follow
rule
and
when
you
connector_7
the
technology_10
of
a
single
resource
you
re
force
to
bump
the
version
of
the
whole
technology_1
that
s
a
quality_attribute_16
nightmare
instead
component_18
should
connector_data_9
the
version
they
want
on
a
resource
basis
with
the
connector_10
if
you
have
issue
with
create
custom
type
you
use
a
custom
but
there
s
no
need
to
tie
the
datatype
version
to
the
component_1
version
again
this
be
what
concern
me
when
consider
long
term
evolution
of
an
technology_1
on
attend
short
term
demand
be
consistent
be
more
important
than
have
a
design
inform
by
long
term
vision
and
these
rule
be
reasonable
enough
for
that
jordan
ambraok
do
you
have
any
concern
other
than
versioning
of
the
component_1
via
uris
here
s
the
issue
that
we
be
try
to
solve
someone
connector_22
an
component_1
component_8
now
in
and
we
re
do
the
best
we
can
to
provide
them
with
an
that
work
well
and
be
the
absolute
best
that
we
how
to
do
but
in
our
requirement_9
connector_23
and
we
now
support
additional
requirement_2
and
one
of
our
connector_data_8
type
connector_23
to
reflect
that
we
ll
say
we
go
from
a
requirement_6
to
a
connector_data_5
of
requirement_6
in
both
the
component_1
input
and
component_1
output
so
how
do
we
connector_18
that
never
allow
for
requirement_6
in
an
component_1
in
the
first
place
and
only
do
connector_data_14
and
make
everyone
support
that
in
their
component_8
it
seem
reasonable
to
me
that
instead
you
would
recognize
that
connector_7
be
most
definitely
go
to
happen
and
connector_10
it
and
build
the
ability
to
adapt
to
connector_7
very
visible
and
very
actively
into
your
technology_1
one
such
way
to
handle
connector_7
be
to
version
your
component_1
whenever
backwards
quality_attribute_16
become
impossible
an
easily
visible
way
to
do
that
be
to
put
it
in
the
uri
or
a
a
a
for
versioning
per
resource
i
totally
agree
that
s
an
acceptable
way
of
do
it
it
s
not
necessarily
the
best
way
because
it
rely
on
the
component_8
to
figure
out
the
version
everywhere
and
you
end
up
with
version
explosion
whereas
if
you
bump
a
version
on
the
component_14
you
can
simply
fall
back
to
a
previous
version
rather
than
connector_13
a
copy
neither
way
be
perfect
and
you
can
end
up
with
the
same
issue
with
quality_attribute_16
nightmare
and
version
explosion
with
both
solution
either
way
thank
you
for
your
think
they
be
certainly
worth
consider
during
a
buildout
matheusmli
t
this
approach
with

versioning
technology_7
myapisite
technology_8
technology_1
widget

i
technology_41
rather
put
the
version
right
after
technology_1
this
technology_7
myapisite
technology_8
technology_1
v1
widget
because
probably
the
component_6
have
a
base_url
constant
somewhere
which
be
technology_7
myapisite
technology_8
technology_1
v1
and
to
connector_7
the
technology_1
version
he
simply
need
to
connector_7
that
pedro
werneckas
i
say
before
i
wouldn
t
recommend
adopt
any
of
these
rule
for
a
long
term
project
the
versioning
of
component_1
via
uris
be
a
concern
here
since
it
usage
reflect
more
on
other
shortcoming
the
component_1
connector_17
be
drive
by
out
of
band
connector_data_7
the
generic
type
etc
the
problem
you
describe
be
a
quality_attribute_13
connector_7
in
type
that
s
addressable
by
proper
usage
of
the
connector_10
and
content
type
by
use
component_1
versioning
to
connector_18
that
problem
you
re
not
only
try
to
solve
an
issue
that
s
already
solve
by
the
technology_7
technology_42
you
re
also
lose
a
lot
of
requirement_6
you
technology_41
connector_2
from
the
proper
usage
of
uris
in
the
first
place
since
you
re
conflate
identification
with
connector_17
i
recommend
connector_24
this
technology_7
www
mnot
net
web_api_versioning_smackdown
the
component_8
doesn
t
necessarily
need
to
which
version
he
need
everywhere
when
you
enter
a
gmail
do
it
make
a
difference
for
you
what
version
it
be
you
hit
your
homepage
where
you
follow
connector_25
that
lead
you
to
the
version
you
should
be
use
since
the
component_14
be
suppose
to
drive
the
component_8
s
connector_17
through
connector_20
it
can
direct
the
component_8
to
the
version
it
should
be
use
even
when
that
s
not
the
requirement_1
the
component_8
which
version
he
need
isn
t
a
problem
at
all
because
that
s
the
only
out
of
band
connector_data_7
it
should
have
anyway
this
simply
can
t
lead
to
the
same
issue
with
quality_attribute_16
one
would
have
by
use
uri
versioning
since
in
this
requirement_1
you
t
have
identification
couple
to
connector_17
which
be
the
cause
of
problem
in
that
approach
it
s
quality_attribute_13
to
do
thing
in
easily
visible
way
but
that
do
t
always
pattern_8
very
well
into
long
term
quality_attribute_18
that
s
another
ballpark
jordan
ambrayou
could
consider
either
approach
front
loading
the
component_1
version
before
all
the
resource
mean
you
be
migrate
the
entire
component_1
at
once
put
it
after
the
resource
mean
the
component_18
can
update
how
they
with
a
single
resource
and
leave
the
rest
alone
either
way
be
valid

harland
gomezi
also
do
not
agree
with
this
versioning
in

since
it
be
an
additional
noise
there
be
plenty
of
way
to
achieve
what
have
a

in

be
try
to
achieve
even
the
backward

issue
i
think
what
you
want
be
to
have
a
backward
quality_attribute_16
in
general
so
that
component_5

your

win

that
the

they

hook

stop

when

have

differently
you
should
be
able
to

more
meaningful
than
incrementing
a

and
a
