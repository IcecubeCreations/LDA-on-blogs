lifecycle
include
the
follow
phase
requirement
phase
analysis
phase
design
phase
cod
phase

phase
requirement
phase
the
objective
of
the
requirement
phase
be
to
understand
the
requirement_2
requirement
and
pattern_8
them
into
the
web
component_1
requirement
the
requirement
analyst
should
do
requirement
elicitation
it
be
the
practice
of
research
and
discover
the
requirement
of
the
component_16
from
the
component_6
requirement_3
and
other
stakeholder
the
analyst
should
interpret
consolidate
and
connector_9
these
requirement
to
the
development
team
the
requirement
should
be
group
in
a
centralized
pattern_9
where
they
can
be
pattern_10
prioritize
and
mine
for
interactive
feature
analysis
phase
the
purpose
of
the
analysis
phase
be
to
refine
and
pattern_8
the
web
component_5
into
conceptual
component_17
by
which
the
technical
development
team
can
understand
it
also
define
the
high

connector_data_4
and
identify
the
web
component_5
contract
design
phase
in
this
phase
the
detail
design
of
web

be
do
the
designer
define

that
have
be
identify
in

cod
phase
cod
and
debug
phase
be
quite
similar
to
other
component_19
base
cod
and
debug
phase
the
difference
lie
in
the
creation
of
additional
web
component_5
wrapper
generation
of
technology_12
and
component_18
stub
test
phase
in
this
phase
the

perform

test
between
the

inspection
of
the

connector_data_6
should
also
perform
in
the

phase
deployment
phase
the
purpose
of
the
deployment
phase
be
to
ensure
that
the

be
properly
