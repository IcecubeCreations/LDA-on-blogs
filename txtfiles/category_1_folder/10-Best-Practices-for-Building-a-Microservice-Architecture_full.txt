these

however
all

provision

each

this

this
will
lead

can

keep
the

consideration
in

when
undertake

manage
connector_19
you
need
to
manage
connector_19
differently
in
pattern_1
architecture
than
in
a

pattern_1
architecture
involve
each
component_11
operate
on

own
however
one
pattern_1
need
to

other

this
be
where
complexity
arise
think
through
the

carefully

find
an
architect
with
the
require
knowledge
an
architect
will
play
a
key
role
in
connector_12
the
pattern_1
architecture
you
need
a
competent
architect
the
architect
might
need
to
use
pattern_6
aggregate
to
connector_6
this
architecture
which
require
appropriate
backend
relate
expertise
remember
that
pattern_2
in
a
pattern_1
architecture
be
quality_attribute_15
component_5
therefore
the
architect
need
quality_attribute_3
knowledge
in
this
area
furthermore
the
architect
need
to
connector_6
connector_21
that
connector_22
connector_data_1
from
multiple
connector_data_1
component_17
that
will
be
more
complex
in
pattern_1
architecture
than
a
monolith
the
project
might
use
the
“event
sourcing”
pattern_4
which
increase
complexity
the
architect
might
need
to
use
the
“common
query
responsibility
segregation”
cqrs
pattern_4
here
the
architect
might
need
to
use
the
“circuit
breaker”
pattern_4
in
some
requirement_5
this
can
help
where
multiple
component_12
collaborate
when
component_11
connector_data_11
one
component_11
might
synchronously
invoke
another
component_11
this
other
component_11
might
have
a
downtime
alternatively
it
might
experience

quality_attribute_16
the
“circuit
breaker”
pattern_4
prevent
such
issue
from
impact
the
other
component_11
load

happen
to
be
another
area
where
the

need
enough
experience
it
help
pattern_2
to
maintain
quality_attribute_1
and
quality_attribute_17
while
manage
the
load
on
the
component_5
developer
might
experience
confusion
about
how
many
to

when
create
a

a

architect
can
make

here
since
