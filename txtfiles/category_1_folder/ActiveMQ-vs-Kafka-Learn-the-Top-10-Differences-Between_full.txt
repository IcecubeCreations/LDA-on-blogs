technology_1

follow
be
the

technology_2
be
a
quality_attribute_1
connector_4
component_8
that
offer
high

also
it
provide
high

that’s
why
it’s
use

connector_data_2
loss
in
technology_2
can
happen
in
the
follow
scenario
it
can
happen
while
connector_8
connector_data_3
in
parallel
for
example
consider
a
situation
where

connector_data_3
come
to
component_13
x
and
y
the
two
connector_data_3
be
component_6
in
parallel
while
component_6
the
connector_data_2
y
be
successful
and
connector_9
the
offset
however
while
handle
the
connector_data_2
x
produce
an
error
consider
that
connector_data_2
b
have
a
large
offset
technology_2
will
connector_10
the
late
offset
and
the
connector_data_2
a
never
come
back
to
the
component_13
it’s
fairly
easy
to
connector_11
exactly
once
connector_data_2
delivery
in
technology_1
than
it
be
in
technology_2
for
example
duplicate
connector_data_2
delivery
in
technology_2
can
happen
in
the
follow
scenario
the
component_13
have
connector_12
the
connector_data_3
successfully
and
then
connector_9
the
connector_data_3
to
it
local
component_14
but
it
crash
and
couldn’t
connector_9
the
offset
to
technology_2
before
it
have
crash
when
the
component_13
restart
technology_2
will
connector_5
the
connector_data_3
from
the
last
offset
in
technology_2
a
connector_data_2
be
basically
a
key
requirement_2
pair
the
connector_data_4
of
the
connector_data_2
be
the
requirement_2
on
the
other
hand
a

be
generally
use
for
partitioning
purpose
and
must
contain
a
requirement_3
specific
key
to
place
relate
connector_data_3
on

component_15
in
technology_11
the
connector_data_2
consist
of
metadata
coding_keyword_1
and
property
and
the
body
the
connector_data_4
technology_1
vs
technology_2
comparison
component_16
let’s
discus
the
top

difference
between
technology_1
vs
technology_2
technology_1
technology_2
it
be
a
traditional
pattern_1
component_10
that
deal
with
a
small
amount
of
connector_data_1
it
have
the
follow
use
requirement_4
pattern_7
pattern_1
high
requirement_5
requirement_6
connector_data_1
distribution
cluster
and
general
purpose
pattern_8
pattern_1
component_7
web
connector_4
of
connector_data_1
restful
component_4
to
pattern_1
use
technology_14
it
be
a
quality_attribute_1
component_10
mean
for
component_6
a
huge
amount
of
connector_data_1
it
have
the
follow
use
requirement_4
pattern_1
activity
track
metric
requirement_7
aggregation
connector_13
component_6
component_1
connector_9
requirement_7
it
have
transaction
support
the
two
level
of
transaction
support
be
technology_6
transaction
xa
transaction
it
us
transactionstore
to
handle
transaction
transactionstore
will
pattern_9
all
connector_data_3
and
acks
until
connector_9
or
rollback
occur
technology_2
initially
didn’t
support
transaction
but
since
it


release
it
do
support
transaction
to
some
extent
it
maintain
the
delivery
state
of
every
connector_data_2
connector_data_5
in
lower
quality_attribute_3
technology_2
component_17
don’t
wait
for
acknowledgment
from
the
pattern_10
so
pattern_10
can
connector_3
connector_data_3
at
a
very
high
rate
connector_data_5
in
high
quality_attribute_3
in
technology_11
it’s
the
responsibility
of
the
component_17
to
ensure
that
connector_data_3
have
be
connector_5
in
technology_2
it’s
the
responsibility
of
the
component_18
to
connector_12
all
the
connector_data_3
they
be
suppose
to
connector_12
it
cannot
ensure
that
connector_data_3
be
connector_14
in
the
same
order
they
be
connector_15
it
can
ensure
that
connector_data_3
be
connector_14
in
the
order
they
be
connector_16
at
the
component_15
level
there
be
something
connector_17
technology_6
component_4
connector_data_2
selector
which
allow
a
component_13
to
specify
the
connector_data_3
it
be
interest
in
so
the
work
of
pattern_11
connector_data_3
be
upto
the
technology_6
and
not
the
component_5
technology_2
doesn’t
have
any
concept
of
pattern_11
at
the
pattern_10
that
can
ensure
that
connector_data_3
that
be
pick
up
by
component_18
match
a
certain
criterion
the
pattern_11
have
to
be
do
by
the
component_18
or
by
the
component_5
it
be
a
connector_18
type
pattern_1
component_8
where
the
technology_15
connector_18
the
connector_data_3
to
the
component_13
it
be
a
connector_19
type
pattern_1
component_8
where
the
component_18
connector_19
the
connector_data_3
from
the
pattern_10
it
be
not
possible
to
quality_attribute_4
horizontally
there
be
also
no
concept
of
pattern_12
it
be
highly
quality_attribute_5
due
to
pattern_12
of
component_15
it
offer
high
quality_attribute_6
too
the
requirement_5
of
both
component_11
and
topic
degrade
a
the
number
of
component_18
rise
it
doesn’t
slow
down
with
the
addition
of
component_13
it
doesn’t
provide
checksum
to
detect
corruption
of
connector_data_3
out
of
the
component_19
it
include
checksum
to
detect
corruption
of
connector_data_3
in
storage
and
have
a
comprehensive
set
of
quality_attribute_7
feature
conclusion
we
have
see
that
technology_2
and
technology_1
have
different
use
requirement_4
for
example
a
requirement_8
will
go
for
technology_2
if
it
have
to
component_6
a
huge
amount
of
connector_data_1
in
real
time
and
bear
connector_data_2
loss
whereas
technology_1
would
be
the
proper
choice
if
it
care
about
one
time
delivery
and
connector_data_3
be
valuable

in
financial
transaction
recommend
this
be
a
guide
to
technology_1
vs
technology_2
