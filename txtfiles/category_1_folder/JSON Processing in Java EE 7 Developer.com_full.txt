conclusion
we
can
see
that
in
most
requirement_9
connector_data_2
and
technology_1
serve
a
similar
purpose
but
what
make
developer
bias
in
favor
of
technology_17
technology_1
be
lightweight
and
fast
than
connector_data_2
in
the
sense
component_1
be
hassle
free
and
comparatively
quick
extract
requirement_6
in
connector_data_2
require
one
to
loop
through
dom
technology_23
throughout
the
document
and
component_11
the
requirement_6
in
the
variable
whereas
in
the
requirement_9
of
technology_17
fetch
the
and
evaluate
the
name
requirement_6
pair
–
quality_attribute_2
and
straight
connector_11
only
vantage
point
i
believe
that
go
in
favor
of
connector_data_2
be
that
it
be
a
mature
extensively
use
until
now
and
a
veteran
in
the
of
connector_data_1
interchange
technology_1
be
a
idea
and
it
presence
be
already
felt
in
the
which
be
the
reason
why
it
creep
into
the
technology_2
ee7
specification
more
will
be
felt
in
it
future
release
i
believe
so
the
question
arise
be
technology_1
go
to
replace
technology_19
