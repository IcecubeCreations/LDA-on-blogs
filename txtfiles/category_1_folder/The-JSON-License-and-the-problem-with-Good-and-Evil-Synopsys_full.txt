the
fly
in
the
ointment
of
the
technology_1
license
coding_keyword_1
by
synopsys
editorial
team
on
thursday


use
of
some
technology_1
project
be
limit
by
the
technology_1
license
which
have
a
problematic
ambiguous
clause
the
technology_4
foundation
recently
reexamine
the
issue
technology_1
technology_5
connector_data_1
notation
be
an
extremely
quality_attribute_5
lightweight
technology_6
for
exchange
connector_data_2
of
all
sort
it
life
up
to
technology_7
org’s
description
a
“an
ideal
connector_data_2
interchange
technology_6
”
but
use
of
some
technology_1
project
be
limit
by
the
technology_1
license
concern
with
the
license
be
not

but
the
issue
have
recently
be
reexamine
by
the
technology_4
foundation
and
the
discussion
be
a
quality_attribute_1
reminder
of
the
importance
of
license
selection
and
a
caution
against
“rolling
your
own
”
the
troublesome
technology_1
license
clause
the
technology_1
license
connector_1
the
whole
text
here
be
typical
of
permissive
license
with
a
grant
of
broad
right
an
obligation
of
attribution
and
a
disclaimer
of
liability
great
stuff
so
far
the
fly
in
the
ointment
be
a
little
nine
word
addition
“the
shall
be
use
for
quality_attribute_1
not
evil
”
“software”
be
a
define
term
“good”
and
“evil”
be
not
and
therein
lie
the
problem
actually
define
or
not
this
clause
be
enough
to
disqualify
the
technology_1
license
a
an
open_source
license
per
se
point

of
the
open_source
initiative
osi
definition
of
an
open_source
license
be
“no
discrimination
against
of
endeavour
”
which
would
include
evil
one
although
the
osi
have
approve
few
than

license
we
track
over


license
in
the
black
duck
knowledgebase
our
open_source
component_2
many
the
technology_1
license
be
minor
variation
on
more
common
license
the
technology_4
foundation
my
sense
be
that
the
technology_4
foundation
in
it
license
selection
be
not
so
much
focus
on
the
lack
of
osi
approval
rather
the
concern
be
it
ambiguity
evil
clearly
be
in
the
mind
of
the
beholder
some
time
ago
the
foundation
justify
inclusion
of
with
the
technology_1
license
on
the
basis
that
the
quality_attribute_1
evil
clause
be
“clearly
a
joke
”
but
they
raise
the
issue
again
six
week
or
so
ago
on
the
basis
that
downstream
attorney
not
connector_2
the
joke
thus
hinder
adoption
and
technology_4
be
all
about
encourage
adoption
rethink
the
decision
they
have
move
the
license
to
category
x
and
they
be
work
to
remove
any
technology_7
license
component_3
from
technology_4
project
use
of
the
technology_1
license
the
technology_1
license
be
not
among
the
top
license
we
see
but
technology_7
license
component_3
be
embed
in
over


project
track
in
the
black
duck
knowledgebase
include
some
very
popular
one
technology_8
technology_9
and
technology_10
it
also
turn
up
in
component_3
of
some
version
of
the
technology_11
development
technology_12
and
runtime
environment
so
if
you
be
run
a
technology_11
component_1
don’t
be
evil
rein
in
license
proliferation
license
proliferation
be
a
big
topic

year
ago
the
osi
and
the

in
general
have
do
a
quality_attribute_1
rein
that
in
the
top

license
cover
approximately
98%
of
the
open_source
out
there
so
an
attorney
familiar
with
a
relatively
small
number
license
be
in
pretty
quality_attribute_1
shape
but
clearly
there’s
a
long
long
tail
of
nonstandard
license
that
adopter
of
must
contend
with
one
common
component_4
of
variant
a
in
the
technology_1
license
requirement_1
be

restriction
to
a
common
license
many
this
one
be
not
ill
intend
some
license
for
example
disallow
use
by
requirement_2
that
use
animal
for
test
or
those
involve
with
nuclear
power
why
popular
license
drive
adoption
however
understand
the
desire
for
individuality
it’s
still
a
bad
idea
to
invent
your
own
license
there
be
plenty
of
official
open_source
license
from
which
to
choose
most
people
or
organization
that
make
their
work
quality_attribute_4
a
open_source
want
to
see
adoption
pick
a
popular
license
will
help
to
encourage
developer
to
adopt
in
addition
work
from
a
common
technology_13
open_source
license
greatly
reduce
the
burden
on
lawyer
with
respect
to
their
review
and
interpretation
of
such
license
to
give
a
sense
for
the
friction
that
can
come
with
a
custom
license
this
discussion
have
in
recent
week
generate
literally
hundred
