and
attract
a
many
component_12
a
possible
via
opportune
offer
before
venture
onto
a
web
component_1
development
project
it
be
important
to
choose
the
type
of
web
component_1
architecture
a
well
a
the
component_3
of
web
component_7
component_2
make
the
right
pick
be
important
for
the
success
of
a
web
component_7
we’ll
discus
how
the
web
component_1
architecture
work
it
component_2
component_3
type
and
then
some
tip
to
make
the
most
out
of
a
web
component_1
development
project
but
before
all
that
let’s
begin
with
the
definition
of
the
web
component_1
architecture
what
be
web
component_1
architecture
the
web
component_1
architecture
describe
the
connector_3
between
component_1
component_5
and
technology_2
component_13
on
the
web
it
ensure
that
multiple
component_14
work
simultaneously
u
understand
it
with
a
quality_attribute_1
example
of
opening
a
webpage
a
soon
a
the
component_9
hit
the
go
after
type
a
url
in
the
connector_4
bar
of
a
web
browser
it
connector_data_2
for
that
particular
web
connector_4
the
component_4
connector_5
to
the
browser
a
a
connector_6
to
the
connector_data_3
make
the
browser
then
connector_7
those
to
show
the
connector_data_3
component_8
finally
the
component_9
be
able
to
connector_8
with
the
the
most
important
thing
to
note
here
be
the
requirement_2
by
the
web
browser
a
web
component_7
work
in
a
similar
way
this
might
or
might
not
have
specific
instruction
that
tell
the
browser
how
to
respond
with
respect
to
the
different
type
of
component_9
input
hence
a
web
component_1
architecture
have
to
include
all
the
sub
component_2
a
well
a
the
external
component_14
interchange
for
the
entire
component_1
in
the
aforementioned
requirement_3
which
be
a
the
web
component_1
architecture
be
indispensable
in
the
modern
world
because
a
major
portion
of
the
global
requirement_4
traffic
a
well
a
most
of
the
component_11
and
component_15
make
use
of
web
base
connector_9
a
web
component_1
architecture
have
to
not
only
deal
with
quality_attribute_2
but
also
with
quality_attribute_3
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_5
and
quality_attribute_6
how
do
it
work
with
any
typical
web
component_1
there
be
two
different
cod
sub
component_16
run
side
by
side
these
be
component_17
side
the
that
be
in
the
browser
and
respond
to
some
component_9
inputserver
side
the
that
be
on
the
component_4
and
respond
to
the
technology_3
requestsa
web
developer
team
develop
the
web
component_1
decide
a
to
what
the
on
the
component_4
will
do
with
respect
to
the
in
the
browser
for
connector_10
component_4
side
technology_4
technology_5
technology_6
technology_7
technology_8
technology_9
etc
be
use
any
that
be
able
to
respond
to
technology_3
connector_data_2
have
the
ability
to
run
on
a
component_4
the
component_4
side
be
responsible
for
create
the
component_8
that
the
component_9
connector_data_3
a
well
a
connector_11
different
type
of
connector_data_1
include
component_9
profile
and
component_9
input
it
be
never
see
by
the
end
component_9
a
combination
of
technology_1
technology_10
and
technology_6
be
use
for
connector_10
the
component_17
side
this
be
requirement_2
by
the
web
browser
unlike
the
component_4
side
component_17
side
can
be
see
a
well
a
modify
by
the
component_9
it
technology_11
to

input
the
component_17
side

only
via
technology_3

and
be
not
able
to

we

etc
these
component_18
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
of
a
web
component_1
architecture
instead
they
be
part
of
the
layout
plan
of
a
web
component_7
structural
component_18
–
the
two
major
structural
component_18
of
a
web
component_7
be
component_17

component_2
the
component_17
component_2
be
develop
in

technology_10
and
j
a
it
exist
within

there
be
no
need
for

component_19
or
component_15

adjustment
the
component_17
component_2
be
a
representation
of
a
web

requirement_1
that
the
end

the
component_4

can
be

programming
technology_12

include
technology_5
net
nodejs
technology_8
technology_7
and
technology_14
on
rail
the
component_4
component_2
have
at
least
two
part
component_7
component_20
and
component_5
the
former
be
the
control
center
of
the
web
component_1
while
the
latter
be
where
all
the
persistent
connector_data_1
be
component_21
component_3
of
web
component_1
componentsdepending
on
the
total
number
of
component_22
and
component_5
use
for
a
web
component_1
the
component_3
of
a
web
component_7
be
decide
it
can
be
any
of
the
follow
three
one

one

be
the
most
quality_attribute_1
a

a
the

web
component_7
component_2
component_3
such
a
component_3
u
a
single
component_4
a
well
a
a
single
component_5
a
web
component_7
build
on
such
a
component_3
will
go
down
a
soon
a
the
component_4
go
down
hence
it
isn’t
much
quality_attribute_7
one
web
component_4
one
component_5
web
component_1
component_2
component_3
be
not
typically
use
for
real
web
component_1
it
be
mostly
use
for
run
test
project
a
well
a
with
the
intent
of
and
understand
the
fundamental
of
the
web
component_1
multiple
web
component_4
one
component_5
at
a
component_6
rather
than
the
web
component_4
the
idea
with
this
type
of
web
component_1
component_2
component_3
be
that
the
webserver
doesn’t
component_21
any
connector_data_1
when
the
webserver
connector_15
connector_data_5
from
a
component_17
it
component_23
the
same
and
then
connector_16
it
to
the
component_5
which
be
manage
outside
of
the
component_4
this
be
sometimes
also
refer
to
a
a
stateless
architecture
at
least
web
component_22
be
require
for
this
web
component_1
component_2
component_3
this
be
all
for
avoid
failure
even
when
one
of
the
web
component_22
go
down
the
other
one
will
take
charge
all
connector_data_2
make
will
be
redirect
automatically
to
the
component_4
and
the
web
component_7
will
continue
connector_17
hence
quality_attribute_3
be
quality_attribute_8
a
compare
to
the
single
component_4
with
inherent
component_5
component_3
however
if
the
component_5
crash
the
web
component_7
will
follow
to
do
the
same
multiple
web
component_4
multiple
databasesit
be
the
most
quality_attribute_9
web
component_1
component_2
component_3
because
neither
the
webservers
nor
the
component_5
have
a
single
point
of
failure
there
be
two
option
for
this
type
of
component_3
either
to
component_21
identical
connector_data_1
in
all
the
employ
component_5
or
quality_attribute_10
it
evenly
among
them
not
more
than
component_5
be
require
typically
for
the
former
requirement_3
while
for
the
latter
requirement_3
some
connector_data_1
might
become
unavailable
in
the
scenario
of
a
component_5
crash
technology_15
normalization
be
use
however
in
both
scenario
when
the
quality_attribute_11
be
large
i
e
more
than
web
component_22
or
component_5
or
both
it
be

a
pattern_2
of

between
various
web

component_2
the
type
of
web
component_1
architecture
quality_attribute_12
on
how
the
component_1
component_20
be
quality_attribute_10
among
the
component_17
and
component_4
side
there
be
three
primary
type
of
web
component_1
architecture
each
one
of
them
be
explain
a
follow
single
component_8
component_14
spa
–
instead
of
loading
completely
component_8
from
the
component_4
each
time
for
a
component_9
action
single
component_8
web
component_14
allow
for
a
dynamic
connector_3
by
mean
of
provide
update
content
to
the
current
component_8
technology_16
a
concise
form
of
pattern_3
technology_6
and
technology_17
be
the
foundation
for
enabling
component_8
connector_18
and
hence
make
spa
a
reality
because
single
component_8
component_14
prevent
interruption
in
requirement_7
they
in
a
way
resemble
traditional
desktop
component_1
spa
be
design
in
a
way
so
that
they
connector_data_3
for
most
necessary
content
and
connector_data_5
element
this
lead
to
the
procurement
of
an
intuitive
a
well
a
interactive
user_experiencemicroservices
–
these
be
small
and
lightweight
component_24
that
connector_19
a
single
requirement_1
the
pattern_4
architecture
technology_13
have
a
number
of
advantage
that
allow
developer
to
not
only
enhance
productivity
but
also
quality_attribute_13
up
the
entire
deployment
component_25
the
component_18
make
up
an
component_1
build
use
the
pattern_4
architecture
aren’t
directly
dependent
on
each
other
a
such
they
don’t
necessitate
to
be
build
use
the
same
programming
technology_12
hence
developer
work
with
the
pattern_4
architecture
be
free
to
pick
up
a
technology_18
technology_19
of
choice
it
make
develop
the
component_1
quality_attribute_1
and
quicker
serverless
architecture
–
in
this
type
of
web
component_1
architecture
an
component_1
developer
consult
a
third
party
requirement_8
infrastructure
component_24
technology_20
for
outsource
component_4
a
well
a
infrastructure
requirement_9
the
benefit
of
this
approach
be
that
it
allow
component_14
to
connector_19
the
component_20
without
bother
with
the
infrastructure
relate
connector_data_6
the
serverless
architecture
be
best
when
the
development
requirement_10
doesn’t
want
to
