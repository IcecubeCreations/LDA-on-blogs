component_6
some

of

be

connector_data_1
in

there
be

on

in

talk

all
be

a

arrive
it

connector_11
instant
which
we
term

connector_data_1
why
we

connector_9
we
need

connector_1
because
we
all
already
that
quality_attribute_10
component_11
such

technology_14
and
other
quality_attribute_10
component_11
support
connector_data_1

on

we

many
organization
be

a
they
can

or
even
their
organizational
activity
track
requirement_21
activity
through
various
use
requirement_20
track
take
screenshots
at

so
with
the
help
of
this
connector_data_1
connector_data_1
engineering
allow
u
to
convert
this
connector_data_1
into
some
particular
basic
technology_17
and
further
connector_data_1
analyst
turn
this
connector_data_1
into
some
useful
connector_data_2
which
help
the
organization
in
several
way
such
a
help
in
improve
their
requirement_8
experience
and
also
technology_18
their
employee’s
productivity
but
on
the
other
hand
whenever
we
be
talk
about

requirement_6
fraud

or
requirement_20
requirement_6
then
this
be
not
the
way
to
component_2
our
connector_data_1
the

connector_data_1
be

now
there
be
a
need
to

which
be
come
from

so
there
be

some
of
