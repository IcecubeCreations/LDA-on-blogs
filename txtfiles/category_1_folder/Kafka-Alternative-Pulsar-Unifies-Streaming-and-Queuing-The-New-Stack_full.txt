oct

by
susan
hall
technology_2
the
technology_7
foundation’s

project
to
attain
top
level
status
be
draw
a
lot
of
comparison
to
technology_1
another
asf
project
technology_2
be
a
highly
quality_attribute_2
low
quality_attribute_3
pattern_4
component_5
run
on
commodity
hardware
it
provide
quality_attribute_4
pattern_5
and
component_6
semantics
over
topic
lightweight
compute
technology_8
automatic
cursor
requirement_5
for
pattern_6
and
cross
connector_data_2
center
pattern_7
meanwhile
the

technology_7
technology_1
report
which
survey
more
than

component_7
find
connector_data_2
pipeline
and
pattern_4
the
top
two
us
for
the
technology_9
it
find
grow
use
with
the
rise
of
pattern_2
architecture
“there
be
a
big
overlap
in
the
use
requirement_6
for
the
two
component_8
but
the
original
design
be
very
different
”
say
matteo
merli
one
of
it
creator
who
have
since
form
streamlio
a
startup
offer
a
fast
connector_data_2
component_5
yahoo
create
technology_2
a
a
single
pattern_8
component_8
a
a
solution
to
it
problem
with
multiple
pattern_4
component_9
and
multiple
team
quality_attribute_5
them
it
be
release
it
a
open_source
in

and
enter
the
asf
incubator
in

for
around
four
year
it’s
be
use
in
yahoo
component_10
mail
finance
sport
gemini

and
sherpa
yahoo’s
quality_attribute_6
key
requirement_7
component_4
in
a
coding_keyword_1
co
founder
sijie
guo
sum
up
technology_2
vs
technology_1
this
way
“apache
technology_2
combine
high
requirement_8
connector_1
which
technology_7
technology_1
pursue
and
quality_attribute_7
traditional
pattern_1
which
technology_10
pursue
into
a
unify
pattern_4
component_11
and
technology_11
technology_2
give
you
one
component_8
for
both
connector_1
and
component_6
with
the
same
high
requirement_8
use
a
unify
technology_11
”
say
merli
“there
be
difference
between
connector_1
and
component_6
there
be
a
lot
of
use
requirement_6
where
you
need
one
or
the
other
but
most
people
need
both
for
different
use
requirement_6
”
two
pattern_9
architecture
a
two
pattern_9
design
be
key
to
technology_2
merli
say
there’s
a
stateless
pattern_9
of
pattern_10
that
connector_2
and
connector_3
connector_data_3
and
a
stateful
persistence
pattern_9
with
a
set
of
technology_7
bookkeeper
storage
technology_12
connector_4
bookie
that
provide
low
quality_attribute_3
quality_attribute_8
storage
technology_2
be
build
on
the
idea
of
have
strong
connector_data_2
guarantee
merli
say
it
be
design
for
connector_5
consumption
while
technology_1
be
not
and
technology_2
enable
component_12
to
configure
a
retention
period
for
connector_data_4
even
after
all
subscription
connector_6
them
it
pattern_9
architecture
and
segment
centric
storage
provide
key
advantage
you
can
quality_attribute_9
the
pattern_10
or
the
storage
pattern_9
independently
since
the
pattern_10
be
stateless
a
topic
can
be
quickly
move
to
other
pattern_10
that
open
up
an
quality_attribute_10
way
to
balance
traffic
across
pattern_10
can
have
multiple
component_13
on
the
same
component_14
and
you
can
a
many
a
you
want
since
no
connector_data_2
be
component_15
locally
it
eliminate
the
need
to
copy
component_14
connector_data_2
when
expand
capacity
and
no
rebalancing
be
require
when
a
component_14
topic
be
create
technology_2
automatically
component_14
the
connector_data_2
in
an
agnostic
way
to
component_13
and
component_16
the
pattern_10
connector_7
connector_data_3
connector_data_2
to
multiple
bookkeeper
technology_12
which
connector_8
the
connector_data_2
into
a
connector_8
ahead
requirement_9
and
also
keep
a
copy
to
memory
before
the
technology_12
connector_7
out
an
acknowledgment
the
requirement_9
be
force
connector_8
to
quality_attribute_11
storage
which
ensure
retention
even
if
you
lose
power
topic
component_14
can
quality_attribute_9
up
to
the
total
capacity
of
the
whole
bookkeeper
cluster
and
you
can
quality_attribute_9
up
a
cluster
by
simply

technology_12
since
enter
the
incubator
a
key
focus
have
be
on
make
it
easy
to
connector_9
start
with
technology_2
merli
say
version


of
technology_2
be
release
in

include
a
“stream
native”
component_17
capability
connector_4
technology_2
which
enable
component_12
to
connector_8
component_17
in
technology_13
or
technology_14
for
connector_data_2
a
it
move
through
the
pipeline
version


will
be
release
soon
which
will
feature
interactive
technology_15
query
technology_2
