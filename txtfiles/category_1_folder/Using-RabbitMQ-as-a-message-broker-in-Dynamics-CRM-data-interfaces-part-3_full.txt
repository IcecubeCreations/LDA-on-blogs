requirement_1
this
be
the
third
of
a
five
part
series
on
create
loosely
couple
connector_data_2
for
dynamic
crm
use
technology_1
last
time
i
show
how
to
install
and
configure
a
technology_1
component_1
to
support
pass
connector_data_3
to
and
from
dynamic
crm
today
i
will
show
how
to
build
a
dynamic
crm
plug
in
that
publish
connector_data_4
connector_data_3
to
a
technology_1
exchange
use
the
official
technology_1
technology_5
component_2
technology_6
the
for
this
plug
in
be
quality_attribute_1
on
technology_7
in
the
messagequeueplugin
project
under
the
lucascrmmessagequeuetools
solution
before
go
any
further
let’s
connector_1
some
bad
news
out
of
the
way
plug
in
that
connector_2
in
the
dynamic
crm
sandbox
cannot
use
technology_1
technology_5
component_2
technology_6
to
publish
connector_data_3
to
a
technology_1
component_1
so
you
can’t
use
today’s
plug
in
approach
from
a
crm
online
organization
in
my
next

i
will
be
show
an
alternate
mechanism
for
publish
connector_data_3
that
you
can
use
from
a
sandboxed
plug
in
but
today
i
want
to
focus
on
the
most
direct
requirement_1

now
that
we’re
clear
on
the
limitation
of
this
approach
let’s
connector_1
start
the
approach
last
month
i
connector_3
a
series
of

about
how
to
create
a
near
real
time
connector_4
component_3
use
plug
in
and
technology_4
j
for
this
plug
in
i’m
go
to
basically
copy
the
component_4
i
use
for
the
plug
in
in
that
series
this
outline
the
approach
in
detail
but
if
you
don’t
want
to
connector_5
the
entire
thing
the
basic
idea
be
to
create
a
plug
in
that
be
register
for
an
create
update
delete
etc
with
a
fetchxml
query
in
it
unsecure
configuration
when
the
plug
in
step
be
connector_6
it
associate
fetchxml
query
be
connector_2
and
then
the
connector_data_5
be
serialize
into
a
technology_8
connector_data_6
which
be
then
connector_7
to
the
technology_9
component_5
via
an
technology_10
connector_data_7
today’s
plug
in
operate
in
the
exact
same
way
except
instead
of
connector_8
the
technology_8
connector_data_6
to
a
technology_9

the
technology_8
connector_data_6
will
be
publish
a
a
connector_data_1
to
a
technology_1
exchange
configure
the
plug
in
to
make
the
plug
in
easily
useable
in
any
organization
without
need
to
be
recompiled
all
the
technology_1
connector_9
parameter
be
component_6
in
the
unsecure
configuration
along
with
the
fetchxml
query
for
the
connector_data_2
to
connector_10
here’s
the
configuration
connector_data_8
fragment
to
enable

both

they
have
to

i’ve
include

in

wrap
up
after
you
register

connector_data_1

you
can
verify
everything
be
work
a
expect
either
by
look
at
