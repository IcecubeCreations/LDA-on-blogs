requirement_1
computing
for

enablement
of

it

into
a
a

component_7
with
all
the
complex
architecture
handle
by
component_1
technology_1
one
of
the
best
way
to
understand
technology_1
be
to
look
at
specific
example
that
weren’t
build
for
the
requirement_1
but
which
many
requirement_1
component_10
currently
incorporate
these
example
include
connector_data_2
orient
technology_1
this
type
of
technology_1
be
an
infrastructure
that
support
the
connector_2
and
connector_3
of
connector_data_3
over
quality_attribute_2
component_6
it
enable
component_7
to
be
disburse

and
make

much
le
complicate
it
hold

advantage
over

connector_data_4
technology_1
connector_data_4
technology_1
also
connector_4
an

connector_data_5

give
component_7
the
ability
to

connector_data_5
component_10
via
an

orient

in
short
it
manage

and
be
use
to
perform

connector_8
between
component_7

it
be
usually
utilize
within

technology_1
this
type

allow
for

provide

there

you
simply
