in

i’ve
help
countless
requirement_7
with
their
requirement_4
challenge
over
the
last
six
year
recently
i
have
a
few
consult
gig
around
amq

pattern_5
the
requirement_5
version
of
technology_1
technology_2
artemis
where
the
requirement
and
outcome
be
similar
that
similarity
make
me
think
that
the
whole
requirement
identification
component_4
and
can
be

and
quality_attribute_4
this
guide
be
intend
for

i

from
these
few
gig
in
an
attempt
to
make
the
amq

the

and
the
expect
effort
more
predictable—at

for

consultant
and
architect

for

in

this
focus
on
technology_1

it
doesn’t
cover
technology_1
technology_9
strimzi
technology_1
technology_21
enmasse
or
the
eap
pattern_1
component_10
which
be
all
component_2
of
our
amq

technology_14
offer
typical
requirement_7
requirement
in
my
experience
a
typical
technology_22
use
requirement_8
have
fairly
basic
pattern_1
requirement
and
constraint
that
fall
under
a
few
general
category
base
on
the
find
in
these
area
there
be
a
few
permutation
of
the
possible
solution
with
pro
and
con
and
the
final
connector_data_2
architecture
be
fairly
common
design
document
connector_4
the
constraint
and
connector_5
these
common
architecture
should
be
well
understand
by
pattern_1
smes
anything
different
from
these
technology_16
architecture
should
be
expect
to
require
additional
effort
and
lead
to
a
bespeak
architecture
with
unique
non
functional
and
operational
characteristic
this
cover
the
follow
hypothetical
but
common
pattern_1
scenario
here
be
a
requirement_7
describe
the
typical
pattern_1
requirement
we
have
around

pattern_2
with
technology_13
and
technology_1
technology_10
that
use
pattern_1
extensively
all
of
our
component_11
be
quality_attribute_5
and
high
quality_attribute_6
ha
and
we
expect
the
pattern_1
pattern_7
to
have
similar
characteristic
we
use
mostly
point
to
point
but
we
also
have
a
few
pattern_8
connector_6
most
of
our
connector_data_4
be
small
in
the
kb
range
but
there
be
those
that
be
fairly
large
in
the
single
digit
connector_data_5
range
we
don’t
our
current
connector_data_6
quality_attribute_7
it
connector_7
a
we
component_11
use
connector_data_6
we
don’t
use
any
exotic
feature
but
we
have
use
requirement_8
with
connector_data_6
selector
schedule
delivery
and
ttl
we
need
to
preserve
the
connector_data_6
order
with
and
without
connector_data_6
grouping
we
primarily
use
technology_23
from
our
technology_6
base
component_11
and
technology_24
from
the
few
technology_8
component_7
we
don’t
xa
but
in
a
handful
of
component_7
we
use
quality_attribute_8
transaction
involve
the
connector_data_6
pattern_5
we
can
replay
connector_data_4
if
necessary
but
we
cannot
lose
any
connector_data_6
and
we
use
only
persistent
connector_data_6
we
put
all
fail
connector_data_4
in
dlqs
and
discard
late
we
want
to
all
of
the
best
practice
and
name
convention
all
pattern_5
to
pattern_5
connector_8
and
component_12
to
pattern_5
connector_8
must
be
quality_attribute_2
we
want
to
control
who
can
create
component_13
connector_9
and
connector_10
connector_data_6
and
browse
if
you
hear
these
above
requirement
you
be
in
familiar
territory
and
this
should
be
useful
to
you
if
not
and
there
be
specific
hardware
quality_attribute_7
topological
or
other
requirement
clone
the
technology_1
artemis
repo
and
go
deep
and
don’t
forget
to
connector_11
what
you
with
others
late
the
constraint
identification
approach
in
addition
to
the
obvious
requirement_7
requirement
and
wish
other
hard
and
soft
constraint
will
shape
the
connector_data_2
architecture
the
requirement_7
might
or
might
not
be
aware
of
these
constraint
and
connector_12
and
it
be
your
to
dig
deep
and
discover
them
all
the
approach
i
follow
be
to
start
from
the
fundamental
and
hard
to
connector_1
requirement
such
a
infrastructure
and
storage
a
show
in
figure

explore
what
option
there
be
for
each
and
document
the
constraint
with
pro
and
con
then
do
the
same
for
the
pattern_9
pattern_7
if
present
the
fundamental
constraint
will
then
dictate
what
be
possible
in
the
upper
pattern_7
such
a
option
for
high
quality_attribute_6
and
quality_attribute_9
further
up
in
the
pattern_7
the
quality_attribute_10
increase
and
one
can
choose
swap
load
balancer
and
different
component_12
implementation
without
impact
the
pattern_7
below
figure

break
down
high
level
requirement
into
specific
constraint
find
the
answer
to
these
point
and
identify
what
be
most
important
and
where
the
requirement_7
be
will
to
make
a
compromise
will
help
you
identify
a
workable
architecture
next
let’s
go
deep
and
see
what
the
specific
constraint
be
for
an
technology_1
artemis
base
solution
infrastructure
this
an
area
where
the
requirement_7
will
have
the
least
amount
of
quality_attribute_10
and
your
goal
be
to
identify
how
the
connector_data_6
pattern_5
fit
within
the
quality_attribute_11
infrastructure
in
a
quality_attribute_12
configuration
it
be
unlikely
that
a
requirement_7
will
connector_1
their
infrastructure
technology_25
for
their
pattern_1
need
so
try
to
identify
a
fit
for
purpose
solution
typically
common
pattern_1
infrastructure
be
base
on
on
premise
infrastructure
with
virtualizers
nfs
storage
and
f5
load
balancer
this
infrastructure
all
can
be
within
a
single
connector_data_1
center
or
spread
across
two
connector_data_1
center
rather
than
three
unfortunately
in
an
alternative
scenario
the
requirement_7
might
be
use
technology_26
or
equivalent
such
a
technology_27
eb
efs
rds
or
elbs
typically
all
of
these
option
spread
across
three
az
in
a
single
region
that
be
the
most
common
technology_26
setup
for
a
small
to
midsize
requirement_4
use
requirement_8
apart
from
computing
storage
and
load
balancer
at
this
stage
we
want
to
identify
the
connector_data_1
center
s
topology
requirement_9
quality_attribute_13
and
quality_attribute_7
be
the
component_12
use
a
single
datacenter
two
connector_data_1
center
or
any
other
odd
number
be
it
an
active
active
or
active
passive
connector_data_1
center
topology
last
but
not
least
what
be
the
operate
component_10
jdk
and
component_12
technology_28
this
connector_data_7
be
easily
verifiable
from
the
amq

support
configuration
component_14
include
what
be
test
what
be
support
for
how
long
and
whatnot
while
on
premise
and
requirement_6
base
infrastructure
offer
similar
resource
the
difference
typically
be
in
the
number
of
connector_data_1
center
and
the

failover
and
disaster
recovery
component_15
influence
these
fundamental
component_16
be
a
slow
component_4
which
be
why
we
want
to
identify
these
constraint
first
storage
once
we
have
identify
the
broad
infrastructure
level
detail
the
next
step
be
to
focus
on
storage
storage
be
a
part
of
the
infrastructure
pattern_7
but
it
require
separate
consideration
here
when
ha
be
a
requirement
which
be
always
the
requirement_8
storage
be
the
most
critical
and
limit
factor
for
the
pattern_1
architecture
pay
special
attention
to
what
option
the
requirement_7
s
infrastructure
offer
a
the
answer
will
significantly
limit
the
possible
deployment
topology
storage
capacity
capacity
be
hardly
a
real
issue
a
typically
there
be
many
unknown
when
estimate
the
exact
storage
capacity
require
most
requirement_7
use
the
connector_data_6
pattern_5
a
their
temporary
stag
area
where
connector_data_4
be
connector_13
a
fast
a
the
component_17
can
handle
typically
there
be
no
component_18
component_7
rpos
define
and
it
be
not
clear
for
how
long
connector_data_4
can
keep
accumulate
put
connector_data_4
into
dlqs
but
will
not
have
a
clear
idea
of
what
to
do
with
these
connector_data_4
late
replay
fail
connector_data_4
be
dependent
on
the
actual
requirement_10
requirement
and
be
not
always
desirable
expect
that
if
a
connector_data_6
be
1mb
in
size
it
will
connector_13
1mb
on
the
disk
a
you
all
from
experience
by
now
that
be
not
the
requirement_8
the
same
connector_data_6
could
end
up
connector_14
multiple
time
more
storage
quality_attribute_14
on
the
type
of
pattern_1
connector_6
style
pattern_10
and
other
configuration
all
of
these
and
other
scenario
can
lead
to
the
accumulation
of
connector_data_4
in
the
pattern_5
and
connector_13
hundred
of
gigabyte
of
storage
if
the
requirement_7
have
no
answer
to
these
point
the
only
prove
approach
for
estimate
the
require
storage
size
be
finger
in
the
technology_29
luckily
artemis—like
it
predecessors—has
flow
control
which
can
protect
the
pattern_5
from
run
out
of
storage
this
question
typically
come
down
to
whether
to
throw
an
exception
or
block
the
component_19
to
protect
the
pattern_5
storage
type
storage
type
be
much
more
important
and
dictate
what
high
quality_attribute_6
option
will
be
require
late
for
example
if
the
pattern_5
be
on
technology_4
there
be
no
master
slave
and
therefore
there
be
no
need
for
a
connector_15
component_10
with
a
quality_attribute_8
lock
such
a
nfsv4
gfs2
or
glusterfs
but
the
component_10
should
ensure
that
the
journal
have
high
quality_attribute_6
when
the
pattern_5
be
on
vms
not
on
technology_4
the
quality_attribute_15
option
to
connector_16
and
operate
be
to
use
a
support
connector_15
component_10
notice
that
technology_26
efs
component_7
be
not
a
full
nfsv4
spec
but
it
be
still
support
a
a
connector_15
storage
option
for
artemis
if
a
connector_15
component_10
be
not
present
alternatively
you
can
use
a
relational
component_20
a
storage
with
a
potential
requirement_11
hit
connector_17
which
relational
component_20
be
support
currently
that
be
technology_30
technology_31
mssql
note
that
use
technology_26
rds
be
a
viable
option
here
too
if
no
connector_15
component_10
or
relational
component_20
be
possible
you
can
consider
pattern_11
pattern_11
require
additional
consideration
one
big
advantage
of
pattern_11
be
that
the
pattern_1
and
technology_22
team
will
not
quality_attribute_14
on
any
storage
team
to
provision
the
infrastructure
also
there
won’t
be
a
cost
for
connector_15
filesystems
or
relational
component_20
and
the
pattern_5
perform
it
connector_data_1
pattern_11
there
be
requirement_7
who
this
aspect
but
all
quality_attribute_16
thing
come
at
a
cost
such
a
the
fact
that
a
quality_attribute_12
pattern_11
require
a
minimum
of
three
master
and
three
slave
pattern_5
to
avoid
split
brain
situation
there
be
also
the
option
of
use
the
requirement_9
pinger
which
be
risky
and
not
recommend
in
practice
the
requirement_9
pinger
avoid
the
need
for
three
of
everything
but
you
should
only
use
the
requirement_9
pinger
if
you
be
unable
to
use
three
or
more
live
backup
group
if
you
be
use
the
pattern_11
high
quality_attribute_6
requirement_12
and
if
you
have
only
a
single
live
backup
pair
configure
requirement_9
pattern_12
reduce
but
do
not
remove
the
chance
of
encounter
requirement_9
isolation
another
cost
be
that
split
brain
could
happen
not
only
for
requirement_9
component_21
and
component_22
crash
but
also
a
a
consequence
of
overload
cpu
starvation
long
i
o
wait
long
garbage
collection
pause
and
other
reason
also
pattern_11
can
happen
only
within
a
single
datacenter
and
lan
and
require
a
quality_attribute_12
low
quality_attribute_13
requirement_9
technology_26
az
in
the
same
region
be
consider
different
connector_data_1
center
a
do
not
connector_18
to
requirement_9
quality_attribute_13
slas
either
finally
pattern_11
also
have
a
requirement_11
hit
compare
to
a
connector_15
component_23
option
ultimately
the
critical
point
about
storage
be
that
while
we
can
make
the
pattern_5
component_4
and
the
component_12
component_4
ha
the
component_24
itself
also
have
to
be
ha
and
quality_attribute_17
and
this
be
possible
only
through
connector_data_1
pattern_11
a
part
of
amq
architecture
it
be
important
to
identify
who
be
replicate
the
connector_data_1
the
component_10
the
component_20
or
the
connector_data_6
pattern_5
itself
through
pattern_11
to
ensure
that
the
connector_data_1
be
highly
quality_attribute_11
pattern_9
here
the
question
boil
down
to
connector_19
whether
the
requirement_7
will
run
the
connector_data_6
pattern_5
on
container
orchestrator
such
a
technology_4
and
technology_15
on
bare
vms
through
homegrown
bash
script
or
technology_17
technology_32
if
the
requirement_7
be
not
target
technology_15
the
question
in
this
section
can
be
skip
if
the
pattern_1
infrastructure
will
run
on
container
and
be
pattern_13
by
technology_4
there
be
a
few
constraint
and
architectural
implication
to
consider
for
example
there
be
no
pattern_14
failover
so
no
pattern_15
backup
pattern_5
present
instead
there
be
a
single
pod
per
pattern_5
instance
that
be
health
pattern_16
and
restart
by
technology_4
which
ensure
pattern_5
ha
the
single
pod
failover
component_4
with
technology_4
be
different
from
pattern_14
with
pattern_11
failover
on
premise
because
there
be
no
pattern_14
failover
there
be
no
need
for
connector_data_6
pattern_11
between
pattern_14
either
there
be
also
no
need
for
quality_attribute_8
lock
which
mean
that
there
be
no
need
for
a
connector_15
component_10
with
quality_attribute_8
lock
capability
and
that
one
can
still
use
these
component_25
to
mount
the
same
storage
to
different
technology_4
technology_33
and
pod
but
the
lock
capability
of
the
component_10
be
not
a
prerequisite
any
long
for
example
in
the
requirement_8
of
a
technology_33
failure
technology_4
would
start
a
pattern_5
pod
on
a
different
technology_33
and
make
the
same
pv
and
connector_data_1
quality_attribute_11
because
there
be
no
master
slave
there
be
no
need
for
readwritemany
but
only
for
readwriteonce
volume
type
that
say
you
might
still
need
a
connector_15
component_10
that
can
be
mount
to
different
technology_33
in
the
requirement_8
of
technology_33
failure
such
a
technology_26
eb
which
can
be
mount
to
different
technology_34
instance
in
the
same
region
so
be
there
pattern_1
component_26
locate
outside
of
the
cluster
connector_20
to
the
pattern_5
from
within
an
technology_15
cluster
be
straightforward
through
technology_4
component_7
but
there
be
restriction
for
connector_20
to
the
pattern_5
from
outside
of
the
technology_4
cluster
next
can
external
component_26
use
a
technology_35
that
support
sni
the
easy
option
be
typically
to
use
technology_36
and
connector_21
the
pattern_5
from
the
pattern_17
if
use
tl
for
component_26
be
not
possible
consider
use
nodeport
bind
which
require
cluster
admin
permission
finally
there
be
a
scaledown
pattern_18
to
drain
and
migrate
connector_data_4
when
quality_attribute_18
down
pattern_5
pod
in
a
cluster
there
might
be
a
few
other
difference
but
failover
discovery
and
scaledown
be
automate
and
the
pattern_5
fundamental
do
not
connector_1
on
technology_4
and
technology_15
high
quality_attribute_6
when
a
requirement_7
talk
about
high
quality_attribute_6
what
they
mean
be
a
full
technology_28
highly
quality_attribute_11
pattern_1
pattern_7
that
mean
ha
storage
ha
pattern_5
ha
component_12
ha
load
balancer
and
ha
anything
else
that
might
be
in
between
to
cover
this
scenario
you
have
to
consider
the
quality_attribute_6
of
every
component_27
in
the
technology_28
a
show
in
figure

figure

pattern_19
at
every
pattern_7
storage
the
only
way
to
ensure
ha
for
connector_data_1
be
by
replicate
the
connector_data_1
you
have
to
identify
who
replicate
the
connector_data_1
and
where
the
connector_data_1
be
replicate
locally
across
vms
across
dc
and
so
on
most
requirement_7
will
want
to
survive
a
single
connector_data_1
center
outage
without
a
connector_data_6
loss
which
require
a
cross
connector_data_1
center
pattern_11
mechanism
the
easy
option
be
to
delegate
the
journal
pattern_11
to
the
component_10
this
option
have
implication
on
cost
and
connector_12
on
infrastructure
team
for
example
if
you
replicate
connector_data_1
use
a
component_20
consider
the
cost
and
requirement_11
hit
if
you
replicate
connector_data_1
use
artemis
journal
pattern_11
but
consider
the
requirement_7
s
maturity
to
operate
a
pattern_5
cluster
consider
split
brain
scenario
connector_data_1
center
quality_attribute_13
and
requirement_11
hit
pattern_5
on
technology_4
pattern_5
ha
be
achieve
through
health
connector_22
and
container
restart
on
premise
the
pattern_5
ha
be
achieve
through
pattern_14
connector_11
component_23
or
pattern_11
when
pattern_11
be
use
the
slave
will
already
hold
the
component_28
in
memory
and
therefore
be
pretty
much
ready
to
go
in
requirement_8
of
failover
with
connector_15
storage
when
the
slave
connector_23
hold
of
the
lock
then
the
component_28
need
to
be
connector_9
from
the
journal
ahead
of
the
slave
takeover
the
time
for
a
connector_15
storage
slave
to
take
over
will
be
dependent
on
the
number
and
size
of
connector_data_4
in
the
journal
when
we
talk
about
pattern_5
ha
it
come
down
to
an
active
passive
failover
mechanism
with
technology_4
be
an
exception
but
artemis
also
have
an
active
active
cluster
mechanism
use
primarily
for
quality_attribute_9
rather
than
ha
in
active
active
cluster
every
connector_data_6
belong
to
only
one
pattern_5
and
lose
an
active
pattern_5
will
make
it
connector_data_4
also
unaccessible—but
a
positive
side
effect
of
that
issue
be
that
the
pattern_5
infrastructure
be
still
up
and

component_26
can
use
active
instance
and
exchange
connector_data_4
with
the
drawback
of
temporarily
not
connector_24
the
connector_data_4
that
be
in
the
fail
pattern_5
to
sum
up
active
active
cluster
be
primarily
for
quality_attribute_9
but
it
also
partially
improve
the
quality_attribute_6
with
temporary
connector_data_6
unavailability
load
balancer
if
there
be
a
load
balancer
prefer
one
that
be
already
ha
in
the
organization
such
a
f5s
if
technology_21
be
use
you
will
need
two
or
more
active
instance
for
high
quality_attribute_6
component_26
this
be
probably
the
easy
part
a
most
requirement_7
will
already
run
the
component_12
component_11
in
redundantly
ha
fashion
which
mean
two
or
more
instance
of
component_17
and
component_19
most
of
the
time
a
side
effect
of
run
multiple
component_17
be
that
connector_data_6
order
be
not
guarantee
this
be
where
connector_data_6
group
and
exclusive
component_17
can
be
use
quality_attribute_9
quality_attribute_9
be
relatively
easy
to
achieve
with
artemis
primarily
there
be
two
approach
to
quality_attribute_18
the
connector_data_6
pattern_5
active
active
cluster
create
a
single
logical
pattern_5
cluster
that
be
quality_attribute_3
transparently
from
the
component_12
this
can
be
three
master
and
three
slave
pattern_11
or
connector_15
storage
doesn’t
matter
to
start
with
which
mean
that
component_26
can
use
any
of
the
master
to
produce
and
connector_13
the
connector_data_6
the
pattern_5
will
perform
load
balance
and
connector_data_6
distribution
such
a
pattern_1
infrastructure
be
quality_attribute_5
and
support
many
component_28
and
topic
with
different
pattern_1
pattern_20
artemis
can
handle
large
and
small
connector_data_4
effectively
so
there
be
no
need
for
use
separate
pattern_5
cluster
quality_attribute_14
on
the
connector_data_6
size
either
a
few
of
the
consequence
of
active
active
cluster
be
connector_data_6
order
be
not
preserve
connector_data_6
grouping
need
to
be
cluster
quality_attribute_18
down
require
connector_data_6
drain
browse
the
pattern_5
and
the
component_28
be
not
centralized
component_12
side
partitioning
create
separate
small
pattern_14
cluster
for
different
purpose
you
can
have
a
separate
pattern_14
cluster
for
real
time
pattern_21
small
connector_data_6
large
connector_data_6
per
requirement_10
domain
criticality
team
etc
when
a
pattern_5
pair
reach
it
capacity
limit
create
a
separate
pattern_5
pair
and
reconfigure
component_26
to
use
it
this
technique
work
a
long
a
the
component_26
can
choose
which
cluster
to
connector_20
to
hence
the
name
component_12
side
partitioning
there
be
also
a
use
requirement_8
here
for
technology_1
technology_21
where
you
can
pattern_5
and
assign
connector_25
to
them
without
the
component_26
need
to
anything
about
the
location
of
these
pattern_5
and
therefore
simplify
the
component_26
and
make
the
pattern_1
requirement_9
dynamic
load
balancer
while
a
load
balancer
be
not
a
mandatory
component_27
of
the
pattern_1
technology_28
it
be
an
architectural
decision
whether
you
be
go
to
use
component_12
side
load
balance
or
an
external
load
balancer
with
an
external
load
balancer
you
have
the
fact
that
requirement_7
use
their
exist
load
balancer
such
a
f5
for
connector_data_6
too
plus
load
balancer
already
exist
in
many
organization
they
be
already
ha
and
they
support
many
protocols—so
it
make
sense
to
use
them
for
pattern_1
too
allow
a
single
ip
for
all
component_12
can
do
health
connector_22
and
failover
to
the
master
pattern_5
that
be
a
probe
attempt
to
connector_20
to
the
relevant
acceptor
there
be
component_12
such
a
the
technology_8
component_12
with
the
technology_24
technology_35
do
not
support
the
failover
technology_35
ootb
here
be
also
an
example
show
how
to
mitigate
this
limitation
use
a
load
balancer
help
with
these
component_12
technology_1
technology_21
technology_1
technology_21
can
act
a
an
intelligent
load
balancer
for
the
technology_24
technology_35
only
it
support
close
low
quality_attribute_13
and
multicasting
type
distribution
you
will
need
to
run
multiple
instance
of
technology_21
to
make
it
ha
that
mean
the
component_26
have
to
be
configure
to
use
multiple
ip
technology_21
can
also
support
many
topology
and
allow
have
connector_26
from
more
quality_attribute_2
to
le
quality_attribute_2
direction
rather
than
the
other
way
technology_21
come
into
it
own
in
a
geographically
spread
mesh
connector_data_6
where
component_26
do
not
the
location
of
each
other
and
any
of
the
pattern_5
they
might
be
connector_27
connector_data_4
to
pattern_22
directional
pattern_1
beyond
the
firewall
and
build
redundant
pattern_1
requirement_9
connector_28
it
s
also
easy
to
quality_attribute_3
the
number
of
pattern_5
without
connector_1
the
component_12
and
the
topology
can
connector_1
without
a
connector_1
to
the
component_26
a
well
dynamic
pattern_1
infrastructure
you
can
also
use
technology_21
to
create
multiple
pattern_5
sharding
an
connector_25
without
the
need
to
use
pattern_5
cluster
but
this
feature
be
only
useful
if
connector_data_6
order
be
not
that
important
or
to
act
a
a
component_12
connector_26
concatenator
especially
useful
for
iot
scenario
component_12
side
load
balance
use
a
load
balancer
be
not
require
in
reality
you
can
configure
pattern_1
component_26
to
connector_20
to
a
pattern_5
cluster
directly
a
component_12
can
connector_20
to
a
single
pattern_5
and
discover
all
other
pattern_5
connector_1
topology
etc
consider
what
happen
if
the
single
pattern_5
the
component_12
be
try
to
connector_20
be
down
for
the
answer
a
connector_data_8
of
pattern_5
ip
can
be
pass
and
custom
load
balance
strategy
connector_16
component_12
side
load
balance
have
advantage
the
component_12
can
publish
to
multiple
pattern_5
and
perform
load
balance
this
feature
can
be
disable
if
publish
to
a
single
pattern_5
be
require
the
downside
here
be
that
the
component_12
side
load
balance
be
a
component_12
specific
implementation
and
the
option
mention
here
vary
across
component_12
component_26
with
artemis
there
be
multiple
component_12
technology_35
and
possible
combination
in
term
of
technology_35
here
be
a
few
high
level
pointer
another
thing
to
consider
here
be
which
technology_35
can
be
convert
to
which
technology_35
when
component_17
and
component_19
use
different
wire
technology_35
and
component_12
the
technology_35
and
component_12
choice
be
unlikely
to
impact
the
pattern_5
architecture
but
they
will
impact
the
component_12
component_7
development
effort
and
this
issue
can
easily
turn
into
a
mess
technology_24


technology_24


should
be
the
default
start
option
when
possible
this
option
be
one
of
the
most
test
and
use
it
be
also
cross
technology_37
and
the
only
support
option
for
technology_8
component_12
keep
in
mind
that
interconnect
the
requirement_5
version
of
technology_1
technology_21
support
technology_24


only
and
if
interconnect
be
in
the
architecture
the
component_26
have
to
use
technology_24
to
connector_29
with
it
a
limitation
of
technology_24
be
that
it
do
not
offer
xa
transaction
support
core
the
core
technology_35
be
one
of
the
most
advance
feature
rich
and
test
technology_35
for
artemis
it
be
the
only
support
technology_35
when
use
eap
with
embed
artemis
and
it
be
the
recommend
technology_35
when
xa
be
require
openwire
this
technology_35
be
here
for
component_29
quality_attribute_19
reason
with
amq

technology_1
technology_2
pattern_5
component_12
it
be
useful
in
situation
when
the
component_12
cannot
connector_1
so
you
be
stick
with
openwire
an
attractive
point
about
this
technology_35
be
that
it
support
xa
reference
architecture
have
identify
requirement
connector_12
and
specific
constraint
the
next
step
be
come
up
with
possible
deployment
architecture
i’m
a
firm
believer
in
the
mantra
there
be
no
reference
architecture
for
the
real
world
consequently
there
be
no
quality_attribute_15
component_4
to
follow
and
connector_data_9
the
find
to
a
target
architecture
it
be
the
combination
of
all
requirement
constraint
and
possible
compromise
that
lead
to
identify
the
most
suitable
architecture
for
a
requirement_7
for
demonstration
purpose
the
follow
be
common
artemis
deployment
topology
for
technology_38
on
bare
vms
instead
of
technology_4
the
same
topology
also
apply
for

where
similar
alternative
infrastructure
component_11

present
the
consideration
that
apply
to
all
of
the
deployment
below
be
component_12
side
load
balance
or
a

can
be
use
for
all
of
these
deployment
load

can
be
co
locate

the

the
example
that
