introduce
challenge

in

â€“
an

this

discus
how
team
in
different

solve
these
challenge
by
build
a
requirement_8
connector_6
component_7
from
the
grind
up
instead
of
use
technology_4

esb
technology_16
in

this
allow
to

quality_attribute_1
independent
mission
critical
connector_6
real

component_4

the
architecture
leverage
quality_attribute_2
component_6
and
fault
tolerance
with
fast
failover
no
downtime
roll
deployment
and
the
ability
to
reprocess

so
you
can
recalculate
output
when
your
connector_10
requirement_1

connector_3

be
still
key

can

roy

say


at


i
completely
agree
with
you
on
the
benefit
of
move
to
connector_6
architecture
however
the
replacement
option
for
exist
pattern_1
and
esb
tech
be
vastly
simplify
there
be
a
number
of
reason
why
technology_2
isnâ€™t
immediately
replace
these
well
establish
technology_15

technology_2
doesnâ€™t
have
a
component_16
requirement_8
cics
cobol
option
mq
be
still
the
â€˜simplestâ€™
way
to
quality_attribute_5
with
the
component_16
and
there
be

year
of
requirement_1
experience
and
development
in
that
space

pattern_9
and
choreography
be
concern
that
live
outside
most
pattern_1
component_10
so
require
investment
if
an
organisation
be
go
to
invest
in
this
area
then
they
be
look
at
esb
style
solution
technology_2
become
a
transport
mechanism
only
we
need
ksql
query
connector_2
to
be
support
a
first
citizen
in
these
technology_16
otherwise
they
become
compete
not
coordinate
choice

technology_4
technology_16
have
many
well
develop
pattern_5
and
ui
base
to
facility
their
role
in
the
technology_4
flow
technology_2
require
significant
development
effort
cod
to
perform
the
same
requirement_12
technology_2
need
a
low

no
option
to
compete
in
this
space
if
we
canâ€™t
replace
these
old
technology_15
with
connector_6
technology_16
weâ€™re

another
technology_16
to
our
already
complex
technology_22
it
provide
capability
but
without
facilitate
simplification
itâ€™s
ultimately
go
to
become
another
piece
of
the
puzzle
hereâ€™s
hop
we
can
solve
all
of
these
a
connector_6
be
the
best
option
for
