requirement_2
requirement_3
build
with
plotly
dash
—
part
ii
have
recently
start
a
project
to
make
requirement_1
analysis
with
connector_data_1
science
technique
before
connector_1
in
deep
on
make
cool
prediction
component_1
there
be
a
problem
—
i
don’t
have
a
quality_attribute_1
requirement_3
for
myself
that
fit
my
need
for
quality_attribute_2
requirement_1
analysis
i
need
to
build
my
own
requirement_3
to
accommodate
my
need
currently
i
go
to
the
follow
sit
for
requirement_1
research

be
problem
to
the
requirement_3
to
each

requirement_1
requirement_2
requirement_3
provide
by
merrill
component_2
merrill
merrillthe
requirement_3
provide
by
merrill
be
great
on
feature
it
provide
a
lot
of
technical
indicator
for
requirement_1
analysis
such
a

move
average
macd
rsi
however
it
take
so
long
to
requirement_4
in
to
account
and
generate
the
requirement_5
also
the
ui
of

technical
indicator
be
not
component_3
friendly
if
i
simply
need
move
average
yahoo
and
financeyahoo
and
provide
convenience
for
u
to
enquire
about
the
requirement_1
requirement_2
and
requirement_1
requirement_2
requirement_5
without
a
charge
yahoo
do
a
quality_attribute_1
of
provide
the
requirement_1
basic
fundamental
statistic
of
the
requirement_1
selected
but
the
requirement_5
do
not
allow
me
to
extra
technical
indicator
it
happen
similarly
to
that
you
a
ticker
and
coding_keyword_1
the
requirement_1
requirement_2
and
requirement_1
requirement_2
requirement_5
both
sit
be
great
to
connector_2
the
real
time
requirement_1
requirement_2
but
lack
of
the
feature
if
i
want
to
do
more
technical
analysis
on
the
requirement_1
requirement_2
stockcharts
technology_1
requirement_3
with
move
average
and
macd
component_2
stockcharts
technology_1
stockcharts
comstockcharts
technology_1
provide
me
a
comprehensive
requirement_3
to
display
the
historical
requirement_1
requirement_2
on
a
requirement_5
with
some
technical
indicator
however
the
free
version
do
not
allow
you
to
look
at
a
requirement_5
with
more
than

month
period
which
be
not
too
helpful
if
i
want
to
look
at
a
long
time
interval
the
requirement_5
to
compare
growth
rate
among
index
component_2
cnbc
besides
the
disappointment
of
the
requirement_6
provide
by
those
requirement_3
there
be
no
requirement_3
from
the
sit
about
provide
a
requirement_5
to
compare
the
growth
rate
of
an
index
requirement_1
benchmark
with
the
growth
rate
of
requirement_1
s
requirement_2
currently
i
only
see
that
requirement_5
on
cnbc
this
requirement_5
be
very
useful
to
see
whether
the
requirement_1
be
underperform
or
outperform
the
requirement_1
benchmark
cnbc
do
not
provide
this
requirement_5
to
me
whenever
i
want
nor
select
the
requirement_1
i
want
to
look
at
so
i
have
decide
to
build
my
own
requirement_3
which
fit
to
my
want
on
my
own
with
technology_2
and
dash
i
want
a
requirement_3
that
serve
the
follow
goal

display
requirement_1
requirement_2
and
relate
statistic
of
one
requirement_1
along
with
a
candlestick
requirement_5
with
move
average
lines2
display
the
growth
trend
between
index
and
it
stockshow
do
the
requirement_3
work
the
requirement_3
be
design
to
have

tab
each
tab
serve
one
of
two
goal
i
have
connector_data_2
display
requirement_1
requirement_2
of
ge
stocklet’s
try
that
with
general
electic
ge
first
on
the
“stock
price”
tab
i
have
enter
ge
to
the
requirement_3
the
requirement_3
would
obtain
the
requirement_1
requirement_2
and
connector_data_3
from
yahoo
finance
then
it
would
generate
a
candlestick
requirement_5
of
requirement_1
requirement_2
along
with



move
average
on
the
requirement_3
when
you
look
at
the
requirement_3
i
can
see
the
close
requirement_2
of
ge
be
$5

the
trend
of
ge
requirement_1
requirement_2
be
flat
because
the

day
move
average
be
flat
but
the
trend
be
go
south
because
the

day
and

day
move
average
line
have
cross
below
the

day
move
average
line
on
the
fundamental
side
we
can
see
the
eps
be
negative
so
ge
be
lose
money
at
this
moment
although
it
be
offer
a

cent
per
connector_3
dividend
besides
display
the
requirement_1
requirement_2
of
one
requirement_1
the
requirement_3
be
able
to
display
the
growth
trend
of
an
index
and
it
requirement_1
let’s
try
with
another
example
by
compare
the
growth
trend
of
heng
seng
index
and
hsbc
hold

hk
in
the
hong
kong
stock_marketif
i
select
the
tab
“stock
index
growth”
the
requirement_3
will
land
to
the
default
component_4
the
follow
requirement_1
index
growth
default
pageyou
see
the
requirement_3
be
display
the
growth
trend
of
heng
seng
index
hsi
year
to
date
you
can
see
that
the
hsi
have
drop
about
15%
since
the
begin
of
the
year
let’s
select
or
enter
the
ticker
of
hsbc
hold
on
the
second
dropdown
connector_data_2
to
the
requirement_1
requirement_2
growth
trend
of
hsbc
hold
to
the
requirement_5
comparison
of
hsi
growth
and
hsbc
requirement_2
growthonce
the
requirement_5
be
re
generate
you
can
see
the
growth
rate
of
both
hsi
and
the
requirement_1
requirement_2
of
hsbc
hold
hsi
be
the
benchmark
index
in
hong
kong
any
requirement_1
with
a
requirement_1
requirement_2
growth
trend
above
the
growth
of
hsi
be
outperform
a
you
see
from
the
requirement_5
the
growth
trend
of
hsbc
hold
be
below
the
growth
trend
of
hsi
therefore
hsbc
hold
requirement_1
be
underperform
how
do
the
requirement_3
work
the
requirement_3
be
powered
by
technology_2
and
dash
first
i
have
define
the
layout
of
the
requirement_3
with
dash
first
for
the
“stock
price”
tab
the
requirement_3
ask
the
component_3
to
input
requirement_1
ticker
and
connector_data_4
the
requirement_1
requirement_2
and
requirement_1
statistic
from
yahoo
finance
if
the
connector_data_1
set
be
successfully
obtain
from
yahoo
finance
the
requirement_3
will
calculate
the
move
average
generate
a
candlestick
requirement_5
with
a
connector_data_2
of
the
historical
requirement_1
requirement_2
and
move
average
line
on
top
of
the
candlestick
requirement_5
with
plotly
and
generate
an
technology_3
component_5
to
display
the
statistic
of
the
requirement_1
if
the
“stock
index
growth”
tab
be
selected
the
requirement_3
will
obtain
the
connector_data_2
of
requirement_1
the
component_3
selected
first
then
the
requirement_3
will
connector_data_4
the
index
and
requirement_1
requirement_2
of
the
selected
requirement_1
from
yahoo
finance
after
that
the
requirement_3
calculate
the
growth
rate
of
each
requirement_7
day
and
plot
all
those
connector_data_1
on
a
line
requirement_5
with
plotly
