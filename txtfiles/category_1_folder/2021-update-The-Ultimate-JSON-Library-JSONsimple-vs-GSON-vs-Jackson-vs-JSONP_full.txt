these

for

between

we
often
don’t
think
about
the

but
there
be
some
difference
between
them
technology_1
be
often

this
be

that
be

in

up

a

so
the

up

fast
time
with

in

look
at
the

across
all
the

run
technology_5
and
technology_3

come
out
well
ahead
on
the

with
jsonp
a
distant
third
and
technology_4
far
in
last
place
let’s
put
that
in
percentage
term
technology_5
be
the
winner
in
average
time
across
all
the
run
look
at
the
number
from
two
different
angle
here
be
the
percentage
connector_data_7
those
be
big
difference
between
the

takeaway
it
be
a
photo
finish
but
technology_5
be
your
win
technology_2
technology_3

be
a
nose
behind
and
the
other
two
be
in

mirror
small

show
the

of

run
for

and
the
total
average
at
the
bottom
the
tally
for

technology_2
on
number
of
win
be
technology_4
–

jsonp
–

technology_5
–

technology_3
quality_attribute_1
–

look
at
the
average
connector_data_7
for
all
the
test
run
across
all
the

technology_4
be
the
winner
here
with
technology_3
quality_attribute_1
and
jsonp
take
a
distinct
second
and
third
place
respectively
technology_5
come
in
2nd
to
last
so
despite
not
be
the
fast
on
any
single

technology_3
quality_attribute_1
be
the
second
fast
in
aggregate
and
despite
be
the
fast
on
a
handful
of

jsonp
be
well
in
third
place
in
aggregate
technology_5
be
very
consistent
across
all
the

while
the
other
three
technology_2
be
occasionally
much
fast
than
technology_5
but
on
some
end
up
run
at
about
the
same
quality_attribute_3
or
even
slightly
slow
let’s
put
the
number
in
percentage
term
again
look
at
the
number
from
two
different
angle
compare
to
the
big
test
these
be
small
difference
but
still
quite
noticeable
takeaway
bad
luck
for
technology_3
quality_attribute_1
a
it
again
lose
a
close
race
but
technology_4
be
your
winner
jsonp
be
a
clear
third
and
technology_5
bring
up
the
rear
conclusion

requirement_7
quality_attribute_3
isn’t
the
only
consideration
when
choose
a
technology_1
technology_2
but
it
be
an
important
one
upon
run
this
benchmark
test
what
we
find
be
that
there
be
no
one
technology_2
that
blow
the
others
away
on
requirement_7
quality_attribute_3
across
all
size
and
all
run
the
technology_2
that
perform
best
for
big
suffer
for
small
and
vice
versa
choose
which
technology_2
to
use
on
the
merit
of
requirement_7
quality_attribute_3
come
down
to
your
environment
then
if
you
have
an
environment
that
deal
often
or
primarily
with
big
technology_1

then
technology_5
be
your
technology_2
of
interest
technology_4
struggle
the
most
with
big

if
your
environment
primarily
deal
with
lot
of
small
technology_1
connector_data_8
such
a
in
a
micro
component_2
or
quality_attribute_5
architecture
setup
then
technology_4
be
your
technology_2
of
interest
technology_5
struggle
the
most
with
small

if
you
end
up
have
to
often
deal
with
both
type
of

technology_3
quality_attribute_1
come
in
a
very
close
2nd
place
in
both
test
make
it
a
quality_attribute_7
workhorse
for
a
variable
environment
neither
technology_5
nor
technology_4
perform
a
well
across
multiple
size
a
far
a
requirement_7
quality_attribute_3
go
jsonp
doesn’t
have
much
to
recommend
for
it
in
any
scenario
it
perform
poorly
for
both
big
and
small
compare
to
other
quality_attribute_8
option
fortunately
technology_8

be
reportedly
connector_8
requirement_11
technology_1
implementation
which
one
would
imagine
be
go
to
be
an
improvement
over
the
reference
implementation
if
you’re
concern
about
requirement_7
quality_attribute_3
for
your
technology_1
technology_2
choose
technology_5
for
big

technology_4
for
small

and
technology_3
quality_attribute_1
for
handle
both
the
benchmark

we
run
the
same
benchmark
again
but
be
now
use
the
late
technology_2
and
run
the
test
on
technology_8

the
number
look
quite
different
from
when
we
run
these
benchmark
previously
in
general
the
requirement_8
increase
drastically
big
connector_data_7

last
benchmark
technology_5
be
the
winner
but
this
time
technology_4
be
by
far
the
fast
with
jsonp
be
a
close
second
and
then
follow
by
technology_5
and
then
technology_3
quality_attribute_1
last
and
again
look
at
the
number
from
two
different
angle
here
be
the
percentage
connector_data_7
technology_4
be
a
clear
winner
small
connector_data_7

in
the
small
connector_data_6
technology_4
be
still
the
winner
clearly
beat
the
other

contender
here
be
the
connector_data_7
technology_4
jsonp
technology_3
quality_attribute_1
technology_5
technology_4
be
component_5
those
fast
by
almost
200+
m
before
the
next
candidate
conclusion

the
obvious
elephant
in
the
room
be
that
technology_8
and
the
technology_3
technology_2
connector_1
fast
way
fast
then
back
when
the
first
benchmark
be
run
it
be
also
obvious
that
technology_4
step
up
big
and
win
