however
many
of
the

have
start
to
shift
away
from

to
have
the

the

traditionally

in

this

some
of
the

such

retailer
often
need

that

want

that

requirement_4
offer
of

component_1
also
do
not
provide
that
quality_attribute_4

many
of
the

retailer
have
be
move
away
from

ci

this
they

become
critical
to
their
competitiveness
pattern_1
for
requirement_7
component_3
while
pattern_1
can
be
use
for
almost
anything
the
real
driver
be
the
ability
to
make

connector_4
for
many
requirement_7

such
a
finance

focus
be
usually
on

however
there
be
certain
requirement_7

which
have
start
to
transform
such
a

these
might

it
be

to

additionally

refactoring
sequence
the
diagram
below
depict
a
traditional
monolith
implementation
of
ecommerce
component_10
typically
e
commerce
component_1
be
componentized
by
pattern_7
presentation
requirement_10
persistence
etc
and
not
by
requirement_9
this
be
often
reflect
in
the
connector_data_2
component_14
which
tightly
couple
different
functional
domain
connector_7
on
other
component_18
make
it
difficult
to
refactor
that
component_19
into
a
pattern_8
usually
it
be
recommend
to
start
by
make
the
component_7
headless
and
build
a
reactive
ui
pattern_7
over
it
one
of
the
risk
mitigation
strategy
for
large
migration
project
be
to
apply
strangler
pattern_5
in
place
of
a
complete
cut
over
e

component_1
be
comprise
of
different
such
a
catalog

etc
the
critical
content
component_19
need
to
be
move
first
to
requirement_4
for
quality_attribute_6
the
home
component_20
and
browse
search
component_20
have
the
maximum
hit
this
be
usually
follow
by

description
component_20
here
be
a
connector_data_5
of

from

a
possible

for
migrate
them
search

technology_5
requirement_14
inventory
ship

requirement_15
account
promotion
cart
associate
face
technology_6
while
this
be
a
typical
sequence
the
sequence
should
be
drive
by
the
criticality
it
also
help
to
start
small
with
a
lean
team
also
it
do
not
necessarily
have
to
be
a
complete
migration
from
the
component_7
i
e
if
an
organization’s
need
be
fulfil
by
transform
some
critical
of
the
component_7
to
pattern_1
to
make
the
component_22
organize
connector_data_2
and
semantics
within
it
bound
component_5
an
anti
corruption
pattern_7
be
require
to
pattern_9
component_5
while
quality_attribute_3
with
the
component_9
component_7
during
the
transition
an
incremental
journey
can
be
adopt
by
a
small
team
where
only
the
critical
be
migrate
to
pattern_1
first
while
build
an
interim
architecture
with
the
monolith
be
split
in
different
domain
component_16
there
will
be
a
need
to
build
materialize
pattern_2
comprise
of
connector_data_2
from
different
pattern_1
for
instance
technology_5
catalog
materialize
pattern_2
need
to
be
build
and
be
keep
update
base
on
technology_5
requirement_14
inventory
promotion

by
keep
it
drive
we
avoid
couple
between
component_22
and
also
avoid
quality_attribute_15
different
component_23
component_3
would
require
their
own
materialize
pattern_2
base
on
individual
need
multiple
level
of
quality_attribute_16
pattern_10
and
pattern_10
eviction
through
pattern_11
subscription
be
recommend
the
diagram
below
be
the
target
architecture
for
pattern_1
base
e
commerce
challenge
a
ecommerce
component_7
turn
into
component_16
the
goal
should
be
to
make
the
component_22
golden
component_24
of
truth
there
should
not
be
pattern_3
specific
inventory
component_16
for
instance
however
retail
requirement_7
have
traditionally
be
organize
in
a
way
that
such
a
move
would
require
synergy
among
a
lot
of
team
with
their
own
priority
in
the
interim
it
might
be
require
to
create
copy
with
a
roadmap
for
other
team
to
start
use
the
component_16
often
the
refactoring
be
do
by
a
team
with
different
skill
set
a
a
risk
mitigation
step
it
might
be
require
to
connector_3
some
enhancement
in
both
old
and
component_7
unless
it
be
a
capability
that
can
completely
be
connector_3
in
a
separate
component_16
that
both
old
and
component_1
can
quality_attribute_3
to
pattern_1
increase
the
complexity
of
component_10
requirement_16
use
a
container
component_7
be
recommend
pattern_1
technology_4
can
help
connector_5
cross
cut
concern
such
a
component_25
gateway
observability
etc
choose
a
technology_4
that
be
easy
to
be
replace
in
part
and
support
polyglot
the
road
ahead
i
expect
the
trend
to
be
move
towards
pattern_1
from
monolith
e
commerce
component_4
to
continue
but
this
will
apply
more
to
large
retailer
who
feel
their
exist
e
commerce
monolith
component_4
be
inflexible
and
want
to
do
more
but
be
unable
to
do
so
another
key
driver
for
retailer
will
be
their
internal
technical
strength
and
their
ability
to
onboard
quality
