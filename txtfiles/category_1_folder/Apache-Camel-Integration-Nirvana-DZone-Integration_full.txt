join
for

take
any
requirement_1
project
and
you
have
multiple
component_2
talk
over
multiple
transport
on
multiple
component_3
a
you
can
imagine
in
large
requirement_7
component_2
this
can
connector_2
complex
very
fast
much
of
the
complexity
stem
from
two
issue
deal
with
the
specific
of
component_2
and
transport
and2
come
up
with
quality_attribute_2
solution
to
requirement_1
problem
make
your
component_2
speak
transport
and
component_4
be
relatively
easy
on
it
own
i
m
sure
everyone
how
to
connector_3
technology_4
connector_data_1
to
their
pattern_3
of
choice
though
it
still
require
in
depth
knowledge
of
the
technology_4
specification
which
many
developer
not
have
on
top
of
that
what
happen
when
you
want
to
connector_4
that
technology_4
connector_data_2
to
another
component_5
you
then
have
to
take
care
of
connector_data_3
the
technology_4
connector_data_2
to
the
component_5
plus
handle
any
concept
relate
to
the
component_5
a
dozen
other
component_2
into
the
mix
and
you
ve
connector_2
quite
a
headache
on
your
hand
ignore
the
mechanic
of
how
to
connector_5
with
multiple
transport
and
apis
we
can
focus
on
the
high
level
design
of
how
component_2
connector_6
fortunately
most
solution
to
requirement_7
requirement_1
problem
have
be
formalize
already
gregor
hohpe
and
bobby
woolfe
s
book
requirement_7
requirement_1
pattern_4
design
build
and
quality_attribute_3
pattern_5
solution
boil
down
year
of
experience
from
requirement_7
architect
into
a
set
of
sixty
five
requirement_7
requirement_1
pattern_4
eips
this
be
great
but
we
still
have
to
hand
all
part
of
these
pattern_4
these
be
not
packaged
solution
only
recommendation
technology_1
technology_2
be
create
with
the
intention
of
connector_7
these
two
issue
in
this
i
ll
show
you
how
it
actually
do
this
what
be
technology_2
technology_1
technology_2
be
an
open_source
technology_3
technology_5
that
focus
on
make
requirement_1
easy
and
more
quality_attribute_4
to
developer
it
do
this
by
provide
•
concrete
implementation
of
all
the
widely
use
eips
•
connector_8
to
a
great
variety
of
transport
and
apis•
easy
to
use
domain
specific
technology_6
dsl
to
wire
eips
and
transport
together
figure
show
how
these
three
connector_data_4
actually
connector_data_3
to
technology_2
concept
to
give
you
a
quality_attribute_2
understand
of
how
technology_2
be
organize
we
will
discus
component_6
processor
and
the
domain
specific
technology_6
dsl
there
be
of
a
lot
more
go
on
here
under
the
hood
but
we
ll
leave
that
for
another
discussion
figure
high
level
pattern_1
of
technology_2
s
architecture
component_6
be
the
extension
point
in
technology_2
to
connector_8
to
other
component_7
the
core
of
technology_2
be
very
small
to
keep
connector_9
low
promote
embeddability
etc
and
a
a
connector_data_5
contain
only
essential
component_6
there
be
over
component_8
outside
the
core
to
connector_10
these
component_9
to
the
rest
of
technology_2
component_8
provide
an
by
use
uris
you
can
connector_3
or
connector_11
connector_data_1
on
in
a
uniform
way
for
instance
to
connector_11
connector_data_1
from
a
technology_4
component_10
aqueue
and
connector_3
them
to
a
component_7
directory
technology_7
tmp
you
could
use
uris
technology_8
aqueue
and
technology_7
\tmp
processor
be
use
to
manipulate
and
mediate
connector_data_1
in
between
all
of
the
eips
be
define
a
processor
or
set
of
processor
a
of
connector_12
technology_2
support
pattern_4
from
the
eip
book
other
requirement_1
pattern_4
and
many
other
useful
processor
to
wire
processor
and
together
technology_2
define
a
technology_3
dsl
the
term
dsl
be
use
a
bit
loosely
here
a
it
usually
imply
the
involvement
of
a
compiler
or
pattern_6
that
can
component_11
keywords
specific
to
a
particular
domain
in
technology_2
dsl
mean
a
fluent
technology_3
component_12
that
contain
name
term
from
the
eip
book
it
best
explain
with
an
examplefrom
technology_8
aqueue
pattern_7
technology_9
person
@name=
jon
to
technology_7
\tmp
here
we
define
a
connector_13
rule
in
a
single
technology_3
statement
that
will
connector_14
connector_data_1
from
the
technology_8
aqueue
connector_3
them
through
a
connector_data_2
pattern_7
processor
which
will
then
connector_3
on
connector_data_1
pass
the
technology_9
condition
to
the
technology_7
\tmp
connector_data_1
fail
the
condition
will
be
drop
you
can
also
configure
your
connector_15
in
a
technology_10
base
technology_11
configuration
this
configuration
be
a
lot
more
verbose
and
le
auto
complete
friendly
than
the
technology_3
dsl
many
prefer
it
though
because
of
it
direct
connector_16
to
technology_11
concept
and
no
requirement
for
compilation
after
connector_17
here
be
what
the
early
example
would
look
in
technology_11
camelcontext
xmlns=
technology_12
technology_2
technology_1
schema
technology_11
connector_4
from
uri=
technology_8
aqueue
pattern_7
technology_9
person
@name=
jon
technology_9
to
uri=
technology_7
\tmp
pattern_7
connector_4
camelcontext
these
be
the
concept
that
technology_2
be
build
upon
since
then
many
other
interest
feature
have
be
detail
of
these
be
leave
up
to
the
reader
to
investigate
to
connector_2
you
start
some
of
these
include
•
pluggable
connector_data_6
technology_13
and
type
converter
for
easy
connector_data_2
transformation
between
artix
connector_data_6
component_13
csv
edi
flatpack
hl7
technology_14
technology_15
xmlbeans
xstream
zip
technology_2
bindy
etc
•
pluggable
technology_6
to
create
expression
or
predicate
for
use
in
the
dsl
some
of
these
technology_6
include

jxpath
mvel
ognl
beanshell
technology_17
technology_18
technology_19
technology_20
technology_21
technology_22
technology_9
technology_23
etc
•
support
for
the
requirement_1
of
component_14
and
pojos
in
various
place
in
technology_2
•
excellent
support
for
test
quality_attribute_5
and
pattern_8
component_9
use
a
pattern_5
approach•
and
much
more
example
a
motorcycle
part
requirement_8
rider
auto
part
supply
part
to
motorcycle
manufacturer
over
the
year
they
ve
connector_17
the
way
they
connector_11
order
several
time
initially
order
be
place
by
connector_18
csv
to
an
technology_24
component_15
the
connector_data_2
technology_13
be
late
connector_17
to
technology_10
currently
they
provide
a
web
to
submit
order
a
connector_data_7
connector_data_1
over
technology_12
all
of
these
connector_data_1
be
convert
to
an
internal
pojo
technology_13
before
component_11
rider
auto
part
state
to
any
requirement_9
to
use
the
web
to
place
order
however
because
of
exist
agreement
with
requirement_9
they
must
keep
all
the
old
connector_data_2
technology_13
and
up
and
run
solution
use
eips
rider
auto
part
face
a
pretty
common
problem
over
year
of
requirement_8
acquire
baggage
in
the
form
of
transport
connector_data_6
technology_13
that
be
popular
at
the
time
use
pattern_4
from
the
eip
book
we
can
envision
the
solution
a
something
figure
figure
this
show
the
solution
to
rider
auto
part
requirement_1
problem
use
notation
from
the
requirement_7
requirement_1
pattern_4
book
so
we
have
several
pattern_4
in
use
here
there
be
two
connector_data_2
one
for
technology_24
connector_8
and
another
for
technology_12
connector_data_1
from
these
be
fee
into
the
incomingorderqueue
connector_data_2
channel3
the
connector_data_1
be
connector_14
from
the
incomingorderqueue
and
connector_15
by
a
content
base
pattern_9
to
one
of
two
connector_data_2
pattern_10
a
the
eip
name
imply
the
connector_13
destination
quality_attribute_6
on
the
content
of
the
connector_data_2
in
this
requirement_10
we
need
to
connector_4
base
on
whether
the
content
be
a
csv
or
connector_data_7
both
connector_data_2
pattern_10
convert
the
connector_data_2
content
into
a
pojo
which
be
fee
into
the
orderqueue
connector_data_2
pattern_11
the
whole
section
that
u
a
content
base
pattern_9
and
several
connector_data_2
pattern_10
be
refer
to
a
a
normalizer
this
composite
pattern_4
have
a
unique
graphic
to
depict
it
but
be
leave
out
here
in
favor
of
it
sub
pattern_4
to
make
thing
clear
implementation
use
technology_2
a
mention
before
technology_2
have
a
small
core
set
of
component_8
include
by
default
the
rest
of
the
component_8
exist
a
separate
in
component_2
that
require
many
type
of
connector_8
it
be
useful
to
figure
out
what
technology_2
to
include
connector_data_8
show
the
connector_9
use
technology_1
technology_25
for
the
technology_2
implementation
of
the
rider
auto
part
example
of
you
t
need
to
use
technology_1
technology_25
for
connector_9
it
be
the
easy
way
to
rapidly
connector_9
to
your
component_5
the
connector_data_8
of
connector_9
include
support
for
core
technology_2
technology_26
technology_14
marshal
csv
marshal
and
technology_12
to
make
the
example
easy
to
try
out
i
ve
opt
to
use
the
instead
of
the
technology_24
if
we
be
use
the
technology_24
we
would
need
to
a

the

}}in
the
requirement_10
of

there
be
a
couple
of
extra
thing
to
mention
first
off
the
technology_12
component_18
will
be
expect
a
connector_20
from
the
component_5
so
we
have
to
handle
that
in

we
have
full
control
over
what
the
component_18
connector_21

from
the
technology_12
each
connector_20
be
determine
by
the
last
in

current
connector_4
definition
each

statement
be
a
connector_4
definition
in
our
requirement_10
we
use
the
transform
to
set
the
connector_20
to
the
constant
ok
since
we
handle
the
connector_20
ourselves
we
don’t
want
any
connector_20
to
come
from
the
technology_4
incomingorderqueue
to
connector_3
to
this
component_10
in

we
the

it
be
important
to

point
that
when
connector_22

the
transformation

we
t
have
a
nice

analogue
we
do
have
support
in

for
unmarhsaling

into
a

though
we
use
this
in
combination
with
a
custom

do
the

conclusion
in
this
i
ve
show
two
common
problem
that
an
requirement_1
developer
face
deal
with
the
specific
of
component_2
and
transport
and
come
up
with
quality_attribute_2
solution
to
requirement_1
problem
the
technology_1
technology_2
project
provide
a
nice
answer
to
both
of
these
problem
a
the
example
have
show
solve
requirement_1
problem
with
technology_2
be
straight
connector_27
and
connector_data_12
in
relatively
concise
in
my
opinion
it
be
the
close
thing
to
requirement_1
nirvana
that
we
have
today
