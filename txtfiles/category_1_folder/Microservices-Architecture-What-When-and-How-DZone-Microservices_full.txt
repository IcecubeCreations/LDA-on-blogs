the
pattern_1
architecture
pattern_3
be
connector_4
a
lot
of
attention
these
day
and
it’s
trend
if
it
be
hard
to
believe
then
connector_1
what
trend
say
you
can
see
a
big
spike
of
interest
over
this
term
start
in

and
the
trend
keep
on
increasing
a
time
pass
this
hype
pattern_1
be
at
the
peak
of
inflate
expectation
in
the
gartner
hype
cycle
component_2
it
be
worth
study
the
pattern_1
architectural
style
even
when
it
be
at
the
peak
of
inflate
expectation
i
believe
there
be
a
moderate
risk
associate
with
it
and
it
would
be
quality_attribute_2
to
spend
time
to
understand
it
a
of
now
it
seem
very
promise
you
also

pattern_1
in
practice
from
architecture
to
deployment
there
be
some
strong
point
which
favor
this
hype
several
big
requirement_7

and
others
have
talk
about
the
way
they
quality_attribute_3
and
ease
out
the
continuous
delivery
of
their

use
a
pattern_1
architecture
pattern_1

doesn’t
seem
to
be
a
buzz
to
ignore
this

the

have
be

more
than
$1
billion
while
connector_4
fund
i
believe
there
be
enough
reason
to
have
a
comprehensive
analysis
of
this
architectural
technology_2
in
this

we
will
talk
about
the
pattern_1
architecture
style
in
detail
we
will
try
to
answer
the
follow
question
what
be
it
when
should
it
be
use
how
should
we
use
it
what
be
it
a
pattern_1
architecture
make
more
sense
when
we
compare
it
with
monolithic
component_5
design
in
monolithic
architectural
design
we
create
a
big
cumbersome
component_5
with
all
tightly
couple
inside
a
single
executable
which
be
typically
quality_attribute_4
on
a
web
or
component_5
component_8
a
typical
monolithic
architecture
component_5
look

there
be
some
disadvantage
to
this
architectural
design
these
disadvantage
or
drawback
have
become
the
strength
of
pattern_1
architecture
no
frequent
and
easy
release
—
a
monolithic
component_7
grow
in
size
due
to
tight
couple
between
component_9
it
become
difficult
to
do
easy
and
frequent
release
release
plan
take
a
lot
of
time
of
people
from
various
group
the
frequent
release
be
discourage
for
make
sure
the
component_5
should
not
break
due
to
the
newly
release
feature
the
problem
in
continuous
delivery
—
we
not
notice
this
problem
if
the
component_5
be
small
in
the
requirement_9
of
big
monolithic
component_5
deployment
time
can
be
frustratingly
long
and
slow
if
a
single
connector_5
to
the
component_5
would
require
the
entire
component_5
to
be
redeploy
then
this
could
become
an
obstacle
to
frequent
deployment
and
thus
an
impediment
to
continuous
delivery
this
could
be
a
serious
issue
if
you
be
serve
a
requirement_10
component_5
where
component_10
expect
the
late
cool
feature
all
the
time
difficult
to
manage
team
and
project
—
project
requirement_11
have
it
challenge
in
monolithic
component_5
development
even
a
modularized
component_5
have
interdependency
in
term
of
deployment
and
release
it
take
a
toll
in
term
of
time
and
effort
to
plan
the
release
and
manage
tightly
couple
interdependent
modular
development
expensive
quality_attribute_5
and
requirement_6
—
it
be
possible
to
quality_attribute_3
a
monolithic
component_5
but
the
cost
be
very
high
lack
of
technology_5
diversity
—
when
we
choose
a
technology_5
technology_6
for
a
monolithic
component_5
we
consider
a
balance
technology_6
that
can
serve
well
for
all
of
our
requirement
we
can
not
employ
specific
technology_5
for
specialize
need
not
easy
to
replace
component_11
—
it
be
very
difficult
to
replace
any
component_9
with
a
quality_attribute_2
design
or
requirement_6
without
affect
the
whole
architecture
definition
in
short
pattern_1
architectural
style
define
a
setup
where
component_5

a

we
should
be
identify

we

and
other

in
a
general
setup
we
can
have
scenario
where
we
need
connector_data_3
from
various
component_11
for
a
single

ideally
we
will
have
an
component_14
gateway
or
front
pattern_4
which
will
aggregate
connector_data_3

so
it
would
be
useful
to
also
take
a

at

there
be

non

component_5
—
we
can
choose
a
different
technology_5
technology_6
for
different
component_11
polygot
it
lead
to
a
problem
of
non
uniform
component_5
design
and
architecture
it
can
increase
quality_attribute_7

in
the
long

—
we
need
to
have
a
mature

team
to
handle
the
complexity
involve
in
maintain

due
to
several
move

it
become

and
require
a

—
initial
investment
to
run

be
high
because
all
the
independently

all
the
issue
we
have

above
can
be
solve
with
extra
effort
or
usage
of
adequate
technology_10
monolith
component_7
be
also
prone
to
a
few
issue
mention
here
in
the
next
section
we
will
talk
about
the
use
requirement_9
in
which
we
should
be
use
a
pattern_1
architecture
coding_keyword_2
s
also
try
to
answer
the
question
—
when
&
how
should
we
use
pattern_1
architecture
when
and
how
should
we
use
it
if
we
try
search
about
the
adoption
of
this
architecture
we
can
see
several

float
around
on
the
successful
implementation
of
it
some
of
the
technology_4
and
requirement_7
who
have
connector_12
it
netflix
ref
ebay
ref
ref
several
other
large
and
technology_5
technology_4
requirement_7
we
should
use
a
pattern_1
architecture
for
any
technology_4
project
in
these
two
approach
monolith
only
or
monolith
first
approach
pattern_1
first
approach
monolith
only
or
first
approach
all
the
mention
requirement_7
have
lately
connector_5
their
component_5
from
a
monolith
to
pattern_1
architecture
while
in
the
begin
they
start
a
monolith
component_5
they
have
steadily
move
converge
to
pattern_1
hence
it
make
u
ponder
whether
pattern_1
might
be
more
suit
to
component_5
which
be
very
large
and
complex
we
should
be
opt
for
monolith
only
or
first
approach
in
the
follow
circumstance
requirement_12
be
not
ready
to
invest
in
the
upfront
cost
that
pattern_1
base
component_7
incur
the
inability
of
the
requirement_12
to
foresee
the
requirement_8
provide
by
the
pattern_1
first
approach
unavailability
of
suitable
manpower
to
build
and
run
pattern_1
base
component_5
delivery
with
tight
time
constraint
sometimes
monolith
help
in
enter
the
requirement_15
very
quickly
when
the
state
of
technology_10
and
technology_5
quality_attribute_10
to
support
the
smooth
deployment
of
the
pattern_1
component_5
be
a
concern
keep
the
above
pointer
in
mind
will
help
in
decide
when
to
use
monolith
only
or
the
first
approach
though
it’s
hard
to
deny
the
fact
that
pattern_1
component_7
be
the
ideal
to
follow
we
must
see
the
requirement_16
off
typically
when
a
monolith
component_5
become
successful
or
need
serious
help
for
quality_attribute_3
and
requirement_6
we
opt
for
pattern_1
we
can
opt
for
pattern_1
in
two
way
extend
the
well
design
modular
component_11
from
the
monolith
—
usually
we
find
requirement_12
people
support
monolith
first
design
think
it
will
be
easy
if
require
to
convert
a
modularly
design
monolith
component_5
to
pattern_1
at
a
late
stage
they
opt
for
a
modular
monolith
component_5
to
reduce
the
cost
they
incur
to
develop
pattern_1
should
the
need
arise
but
this
be
a
distant
dream
often
far
from
reality
recreate
the
pattern_1
component_5
from
scratch
and
connector_data_6
the
exist
monolith
component_5
—
most
of
the
time
pattern_1
component_7
be
develop
from
scratch
because
of
bad
quality_attribute_11
in
monolith
component_5
pattern_1
first
approach
when
we
start
develop
component_7
we
always
wish
to
keep
them
modular
each
should
have
a
distinct
set
of
responsibility
we
try
to
do
so
to
reduce
the
complexity
of
component_7
in
the
hope
of
achieve
extensionality
and
quality_attribute_7
i
think
if
quality_attribute_11
be
the
prime
reason
to
opt
for
pattern_1
then
why
should
this
not
be
a
possibility
in
monolith
component_5
after
all
we
can
have
it
in
monolith
component_7
too
what
we
expect
from
an
component_5
in
term
of
quality_attribute_11
and
what
we
connector_3
be
demonstrate
in
this
illustration
i
think
the
answer
lie
in
the
way
we
develop
and
how
it
grow
from
a
small
piece
to
a
very
large
chunk
in
monolith
component_5
we
be
always
tempt
to
develop
thing
very
quickly
and
we
connector_3
the
opportunity
to
do
so
because
there
be
no
hard
boundary
define
and
while
churn
thing
quickly
we
lose
it
quality_attribute_11
in
the
long
term
these
overlap
modular
requirement_13
kill
team
productivity
and
we
face
a
hard
time
optimize
and
quality_attribute_12
component_5
even
idle
modular
monolith
component_7
will
have
a
centralized
component_1
for
all
of
it

i
believe
if
we
try
to
find
out
one
idle
modular
monolith
component_5
in
production
it
will
be
very
difficult
for
u
pattern_1
component_7
have
decentralization
a
their
core
concept
and
it
provide
a
hard
line
between
along
with
decentralized
connector_data_3
storage
by
design
it
be
difficult
for
developer
to
cross
the
line
and
it
help
in
enforce
real
modular
component_5
the
connector_data_7
give
u
benefit
which
have
already
be
mention
we
should
therefore
be
opt
for
the
pattern_1
first
approach
when
quality_attribute_11
and
decentralization
be
an
important
aspect
from
the
begin
of
any
project
the
component_5
in
focus
will
have
high
volume
transaction
or
traffic
preference
for
long
term
benefit
in
comparison
to
those
in
the
short
term
quality_attribute_13
of
the
right
set
of
people
to
design
develop
and
quality_attribute_4
component_7
quickly
in
the
initial
phase
—
it
have
be
observe
that
the
initial
effort
to
start
a
pattern_1
base
project
be
more
in
comparison
to
a
monolith
one
commitment
to
use
cut
edge
technology_10
and
technology_5
—
pattern_1
be
very
young
architectural
approach
technology_10
and
technology_5
require
to
support
it
be
very
or
in
rapid
connector_5
mode
conclusion
the
pattern_10
architecture
be
not
a
approach
it
soul
be
always
there
for
year
in
the
form
of
pattern_11
component_4
orient
architecture
web
component_4
and
in
a
modular
and
pattern_12
architecture
it
be
gain
momentum
primarily
due
to
the
follow
factor
frustration
at
not
connector_4
the
desire
output
expect
from
architecture
a
monolith
quality_attribute_13
of

to
develop

that

for

big

adaptation
for
pattern_1
architecture
in
the
come
year
it
will
be
no
surprise
to
see
it
grow
at
a
level
in
which
engineer
will
be
use
