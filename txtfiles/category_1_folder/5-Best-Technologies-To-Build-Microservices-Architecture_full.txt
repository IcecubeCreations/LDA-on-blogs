this
not
be
the
ideology
on
which
pattern_1
work
but
it
surely
be
the
principle
we
follow
while
develop
an
component_3
on
the
pattern_1
architecture
pattern_1
be
gain
popularity
in
the
requirement_9
a
requirement_10
work
towards
build
complex
and
large
component_6
that
can
be
segregate
and
handle
a
a
compilation
of
small
component_7
there
have
be
an
increasing
number
of
people
look
to
redesign
their
traditional
monolithic
component_8
into
a
sequence
of
single
independent
pattern_1
the
natural
question
that
come
to
your
mind
be
which
be
the
most
favorable
technology_20
to
be
use
while
develop
pattern_1
for
your
next
project
you
can
use
various
technology_1
base
on
what
best
serve
the
purpose
of
your
pattern_1
let’s
go
through
some
of
the
programming
technology_20
that
have
the
feature
and
technology_26
which
will
help
you
in
connector_2
your
do
but
first
let’s
begin
by
understand
pattern_1
what
be
pattern_1
architecture
the
pattern_1
architecture
be
a
development
methodology
wherein
you
can
fragment
a
single
component_9
into
a
series
of
small
component_7
each
connector_3
in
it
own
component_10
and
connector_4
with
lightweight
mechanism
the
pattern_1
be
develop
around
requirement_10
capability
which
be
independently
quality_attribute_2
with
automate
deployment
mechanism
the
pattern_1
architecture
need
a
bare
minimum
of
requirement_6
of
these
component_7
build
in
different
programming
technology_20
and
employ
different
connector_data_3
storage
technology_1
reason
to
migrate
to
pattern_1
architecture
in
a
monolithic
architecture
for
a
large
component_9
it
be
hard
to
comprehend
the
complexity
and
sometimes
it
be
tough
to
handle
the

component_6
require
extensive
manual
test
in
order
to
comprehend
the
impact
of
alteration
even
for
a
small
connector_5
the
entire
component_9
require
to
be
quality_attribute_3
again
the
heavy
component_9
with
monolithic
architecture
can
slow
down
the
start

of

it
be
easy
for
developer
to
develop

even
the

with

you
can
build
a
quality_attribute_12

to
extend
the
requirement_10

take
advantage
of
diversity
in
technology_20
of

you
can
use

it

not

the

hence

a
