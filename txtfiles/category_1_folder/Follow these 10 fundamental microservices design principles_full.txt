and
adopt
the
approach
for

however
there
be
inherent
challenge
component_2
designer
architect
and
developer
face
around
quality_attribute_2
requirement_5
and
deployment
use
these
key
pattern_1
design
principle
a
guideline
to
build
component_6
that
meet
expectation
and
avoid
short
and
long
term
lifecycle
issue
they
range
from
conceptual
such
a
how
to
define
the
scope
of
a
component_7
and
maintain
connector_data_1
autonomy
to
practical
such
a
what
pattern_2
to
use
to
maximize

traffic
requirement_5
ensure
high
pattern_3
and
low
couple
pattern_3
and
couple
be
two
term
often
use
interchangeably
when
describe
a
pattern_1
architecture
the
former
relate
to
the
degree
of
intradependence
that
exist
between
the
of
an
component_2
and
the
latter
be
use
for
the
degree
of
interdependency
you
should
design
pattern_1
so
that
pattern_3
be
high
and
couple
be
low
this
plan
create
pattern_1
that
be
quality_attribute_3
to
connector_3
quality_attribute_4
and
can

component_4
in
an

should
be
easy
to

because
the

define
the
scope
properly
you
should
define
the
requirement_6
of
a

describe
what
it
be
intend
to
do
the
scope
of
a
pattern_4
correspond
to
the
requirement
of
an

requirement_7
it
s
important
to
set
a
proper
scope
for
each
pattern_4
in
order
to
rationalize
it
size
and
define
it
boundary
adhere

the

principle
state
that

this
principle
be
essential
to

there
should
not

one
of
the

of

be
to
create
fault
tolerant

component_9
failure
or
requirement_5
issue
in

component_7
should

component_7
a

leak
component_10
connector_7
problem
or
other
issue
in
one
pattern_4
should
not
bring
the
entire
component_2
down
since
the
component_11
in
a
pattern_1
base
component_2
be
autonomous
and
independent
they
can
take
advantage
of
the
circuit
breaker
pattern_2
which
be
a
mean
to
cut
off
connector_8
with
one
or
more
component_11
that
be
down
or
experience
error
build
around
requirement_7
capability
each
pattern_4
should
be
design
to
solve
a
requirement_7
problem
the
developer
can
use
the
appropriate
technology_3
technology_4
for
each
requirement_7
problem
in
each
pattern_4
unlike
a
monolithic
component_2
you
be
not

to
use
a
single

homogenous
technology_3
technology_4
for
the

this
pattern_1
design
principle

developer
should
choose
what
s
best
and
readily
quality_attribute_6
for
use
in

component_8
of
the

decentralize
connector_data_1
unlike
in

pattern_1
each
maintain
their
own
copy
of
the
connector_data_1
in
other
word
each
pattern_4
have
it
own
component_10
you
should
not
set
up
multiple
component_11
