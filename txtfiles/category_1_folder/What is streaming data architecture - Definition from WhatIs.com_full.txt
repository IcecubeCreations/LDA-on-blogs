this

with

by

contributor
a

connector_data_1

be

a

in

continuous
connector_5
of

this
type
of
architecture
have
three
basic
component_8
an
aggregator
that
gather
connector_6
and
pattern_3
from
a
variety
of
connector_data_1
component_9
a
pattern_4
that
make
connector_data_1
quality_attribute_3
for
consumption
and
an
requirement_3
component_10
that
analyze
the
connector_data_1
correlate
requirement_9
and
blend
connector_6
together
the
component_11
that
connector_7
and
connector_8
connector_data_1
connector_6
and
connector_9
the
component_12
and
real
time
requirement_3
component_13
be
connector_10
the
connector_5
processor
because
a
connector_1
connector_data_1
architecture
support
the
concept
of
component_9
it
reduce
the
need
for
developer
to
create
and
maintain
connector_11
component_2
instead
all
connector_12
to
an
application’s
state
be
component_14
a
a
sequence
of
pattern_5
component_7
pattern_6
connector_13
that
can
be
reconstruct
or
query
when
necessary
upon
connector_14
an

the
connector_5
processor
technology_9
in
real
or
near
real
time
and
connector_13
an
action
such
a
remember
the
for
future
reference
the
grow
popularity
of
connector_1
connector_data_1
architecture
reflect
a
shift
in
the
development
of
component_4
and
technology_10
from
a
monolithic
architecture
to
a
decentralized
one
build
with
pattern_7
this
type
of
architecture
be
usually
more
quality_attribute_4
and
quality_attribute_5
than
a
classic
component_2
centric
component_12
architecture
because
it
co
locate
connector_data_1
component_7
with
storage
to
lower
component_12
connector_15
time
quality_attribute_6
and
improve
quality_attribute_7
another
advantage
of
use
a
connector_1
connector_data_1
architecture
be
that
it
factor
the
time
an
occur
into
account
which
make
it
easy
for
an
application’s
state
and
component_7
to
be
component_15
and
quality_attribute_8
across
many
instance
connector_1
connector_data_1

developer
to
develop

that

both
bind
