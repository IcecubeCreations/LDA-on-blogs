knowledge
base
and
chatbots
be
the
future
of
tech
support
when
it
come
to
chatbots
the
requirement_1
be
full
of
noise
in
a
battle
to
win
more
requirement_2
in
their
clientele
connector_data_1
every
requirement_3
requirement_4
be
claim
that
their
solution
have
artificial_intelligencewhat
do
we
mean
by
requirement_5
in
chatbots
be
it
some
kind
of
proprietary
component_1
or
an
open
component_2
component_3
from
technology_1
to
make
your
requirement_3
intelligent
i
be
afraid
but
it’s
none
requirement_5
isn’t
an
component_3
or
solution
that
you
can
quality_attribute_1
into
your
tech
support
to
acquire
intelligence
and
tech
support
automation
overnight
requirement_5
be
a
concept
that
work
on
a
mix
of
two
technology_2
natural
technology_3
component_4
nlp
and
requirement_6
ml
when
it
come
to
requirement_5
in
chatbots
the
same
two
technology_2
work
collaboratively
to
automate
a
plethora
of
connector_data_2
that
otherwise
require
human
intervention
in
one
or
another
form
for
example
understand
a
query
connector_1
by
a
requirement_7
in
the
live
chat
window
and
then
connector_data_3
to
it
base
on
the
connector_data_4
refer
from
the
knowledge
base
even
if
a
human
chat
executive
be
handle
the
chat
support
this
particular
sequence
of
step
be
eminent
with
requirement_5
in
your
requirement_3
you
automate
this
exact
sequence
and
a
lot
of
others
a
well
the
nlp
help
the
requirement_3
to
understand
even
those
connector_2
that
we
don’t
component_1
whereas
the
ml
help
the
requirement_3
to
find
a
precise
connector_3
for
the
query
base
on
the
knowledge
base
that
we
fee
to
a
requirement_3
the
knowledgebase
be
fuel
for
requirement_5
chatbotsthe
knowledgebase
be
the
technology_4
of
not
chatbots
but
any
requirement_5
component_5
it
be
where
an
requirement_5
requirement_3
find
the
resource
it
need
to
make
an
autonomous
decision
without
a
proper
requirement_3
knowledge
base
requirement_8
chatbots
can’t
have
requirement_5
at
all
think
of
the
situation
when
you
sit
on
live
chat
support
of
your
ecommerce
and
a
component_6
come
on
it
to
ask
the
follow
question
“hi
could
you
please
tell
me
my
order
status
my
order
number
be
#xyz”would
you
be
able
to
give
a
proper
connector_data_3
to
this
query
if
you
can’t
connector_4
your
requirement_7
component_7
and
see
the
order
status
from
there
of
not
that’s
requirement_3
knowledge
base
to
the
requirement_5
chatbots
the
best
part
be
with
deep
requirement_6
chatbots
can
connector_4
not
component_8
requirement_7
connector_data_5
but
also
analyze
every
bit
of
complex
connector_data_4
you
fee
them
and
come
up
with
even
complex
component_5
besides
fetch
quality_attribute_2
order
status
connector_data_4
from
the
requirement_7
component_7
a
requirement_3
knowledge
base
be
not
a
mere
pattern_1
of
connector_data_4
but
a
complex
architecture
which
comprise
of
every
bit
of
useful
connector_data_4
you
can

however
it
be
not

a
it
sound
the
role
of
requirement_5
in
chatbots
be
to
enable
them
to
component_4

transform
natural

into

insight
further
after

a

without

chatbots
need
a

to

component_9
without

your

component_9
that
doesn’t
work
for

you

the

which
be
fuel
to
your
requirement_3
help
your
requirement_2
in
vice

situation
a
well
when
chatbots
have
connector_4
to
your
knowledge
base
and
every
bit
of
corporate
connector_data_4
they
can
also
help
you
to
organize
your
connector_data_5
more
efficiently
·
more
organize
the
traditional
component_13
to
component_14
connector_data_4
and
component_7
in

connector_data_7
be
complex
and
le
organize
if
you
need
to
connector_4
any
connector_data_4
from
your
traditional
knowledge
base
it
take
some
time
and
effort
to
traverse
through
different
directory
or
search
use
limit
keywords
chatbots
can
organize
your
connector_data_4
more
neatly
and
provide
direct
connector_3
to
your
connector_data_5
drive
connector_2
in
microsecond
you
won’t
have
to
requirement_12
through
a
deep
directory
but
ask
the
requirement_3
and
it
will
fetch
what
you
want

connector_data_4
to
acquire
the
knowledge
of

you
need
to
follow
too
first
connector_5
a
piece
of
connector_data_4
and
then
component_4
it
to
gain
meaningful
insight
instead
of
drive
you
through
a
complex
back
end
component_4
a
requirement_3
can
give
direct
connector_3
and
show
the
connector_data_4
you
need
without
any
clutter
chatbots
be

only
with
knowledge
managementai
powered
chatbots
be
indeed
the
future
of

and
requirement_2

component_9
however
there
be
no

without

knowledge
requirement_8
without
connector_data_4
chatbots
lack
the
primary
fuel
that
enable
them
to
take
decision
that’s
why
have
a

not
enough
you
