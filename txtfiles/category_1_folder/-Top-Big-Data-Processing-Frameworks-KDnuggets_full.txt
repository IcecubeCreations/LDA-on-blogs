with

need
trump
the

the

of

no

refer
to
a
requirement_2
today
s
requirement_1

tomorrow
s
that
s
cute
owe
to
the
exponential
growth
in
the
connector_data_1
that
we
a
a
society
be
create
keep
and
want
to
component_1
a
such
traditional
connector_data_1
component_1
technology_7
which
do
not
quality_attribute_1
to
requirement_1
will
eventually
become
obsolete
so
the
question
be
what
be
we
do
with
this
connector_data_1
the
answer
of

be
very
component_3
dependent
but
everyone
be
component_1
requirement_1
and
it
turn
out
that
this
component_1
can
be
abstract
to
a
degree
that
can
be
deal
with
by
all
sort
of
requirement_1
component_1
technology_1
a
few
of
these
technology_1
be
very
well

technology_4
and
technology_5
i
m
look
at
you
while
others
be
more
niche
in
their
usage
but
have
still
manage
to
carve
out
respectable
requirement_4
connector_2
and
reputation
we
will
take
a
look
at

of
the
top
open_source
requirement_1
component_1
technology_1
be
use
today
of

these
aren
t
the
only
one
in
use
but
hopefully
they
be
consider
to
be
a
small
representative
sample
of
what
be
quality_attribute_2
and
a
brief
overview
of
what
can
be
accomplish
with
the
selected
technology_7

technology_4
first
up
be
the
all
time
classic
and
one
of
the
top
technology_1
in
use
today
so
prevalent
be
it
that
it
have
almost
become
synonymous
with
requirement_1
but
you
already
about
technology_4
and
mapreduce
and
it
ecosystem
of
technology_7
and
technology_8
include
technology_9
and
technology_10
and
technology_11
and
technology_12
and
all
the
others
technology_4
be
first
out
of
the
gate
and
enjoy
and
still
do
enjoy
widespread
adoption
in
requirement_5
so
why
would
you
still
use
technology_4
give
all
of
the
other
option
out
there
today
despite
the
fact
that
technology_4
component_4
often
complex
requirement_1
and
have
a
slew
of
technology_7
that
follow
it
around
an
entourage
technology_4
and
it
underlie
mapreduce
be
actually
quite
quality_attribute_3
if
your
connector_data_1
can
be
component_1
in
pattern_2
and
split
into
small
component_1

spread
across
a
cluster
and
their
effort
recombine
all
in
a
logical
manner
technology_4
will
probably
work
fine
for
you
a
number
of
technology_7
in
the
technology_4
ecosystem
be
useful
far
beyond
support
the
original
mapreduce
algorithm
that
technology_4
start
a
of
particular
note
and
of
a
foreshadowing
nature
be
technology_13
the
resource
requirement_6

for
the

it
can

basic

technology_5
technology_5
be
the
heir
apparent
to
the
requirement_1
component_1
kingdom
technology_5
and
technology_4
be
often
contrast
a
an
either
or
choice
but
that
isn
t
really
the
requirement_7
the
technology_4
ecosystem
can
accommodate
the
technology_5
component_1
component_6
in
place
of
mapreduce
lead
to
all
sort
of
different
environment
make
up
that
include
a
mix
of
technology_7
and
technology_8
from
both
ecosystem
a
one
specific
example
of
this
interplay
requirement_1
powerhouse
technology_14
be
now
replace
mapreduce
with
technology_5
a
the
default
component_1
component_6
in
all
of
it
technology_4
implementation
move
connector_3
a
another
example
technology_5
do
not
include
it

quality_attribute_4
storage
pattern_3
and
a
such
it
take
advantage
of
technology_4
s
quality_attribute_4
filesystem
technology_12
among
other
technology_8
unrelated
to
technology_4
such
a
mesos
technology_5
differ
from
technology_4
and
the
mapreduce
paradigm
in
that
it
work
in
memory
quality_attribute_5
up
component_1
time
technology_5
also
circumvent
the
impose
linear
dataflow
of
technology_4
s
default
mapreduce
component_6
allow
for
a
more
quality_attribute_6
pipeline
construction
when
would
you
choose
technology_5
if
you

t
want
to
be
shackle
by
the
mapreduce
paradigm
and

t
already
have
a
technology_4
environment
to
work
with
or
if
in
memory
component_1
will
have
a
noticeable
effect
on
component_1
time
this
would
be
a
quality_attribute_7
reason
to
look
at
technology_5

component_1

also
if
you

mlib

exploit

that

be
not

when
it
come
to

requirement_1

they
aren

the
only

we
look
