be
a
black
component_7
that
connector_3
connector_data_3
from
some
and
connector_4
it
to
another
one
within
the
black
component_7
the
connector_data_3
be
component_8
or
simply
redirect
so
why
have
a
technology_11
for
this
in
practical
situation
a
see
in
the
introduction
requirement_8
study
there
be
many
sender
and
many
receiver
each
follow
it
own
technology_12
such
a
technology_13
technology_14
and
technology_15
the
component_9
require
many
complex
rule
such
a
connector_data_2
from
sender
a
should
be
connector_5
only
to
b
&
technology_16
in
situation
you
have
to
pattern_1
the
connector_data_2
to
another
technology_17
that
the
receiver
expect
this
translation
be
subject
to
certain
condition
base
on
the
connector_data_2
content
so
essentially
you
need
to
pattern_1
between
technology_12
glue
component_4
together
define
connector_6
rule
and
provide
pattern_2
base
on
connector_data_2
content
this
be
illustrate
in
the
follow
figure
−
to
meet
the
above
requirement
and
design
a
proper
architecture
for
many
such
situation
requirement_9
requirement_10
pattern_3
eip
be
document
by
gregor
hohpe
and
bobby
woolf
in
technology_1
technology_2
provide
the
implementation
of
these
pattern_3
and
the
purpose
of
this
be
to
teach
you
how
to
use
technology_2
in
situation
the
one
describe
in
the
introduction
technology_1
technology_2
be
an
open_source
technology_11
it
be
a
connector_data_2
orient
technology_18
that
provide
rule
base
connector_6
and
mediation
component_10
you
can
define
rule
such
a
if
it
be
a
“milk”
order
redirect
it
to
a
milk
vendor
and
if
it
be
an
“oil”
order
redirect
it
to
an
oil
vendor
and
so
on
use
technology_2
you
will
be
able
to
connector_7
these
rule
and
do
the
connector_6
in
a
familiar
technology_5
it
mean
that
you
can
use
your
familiar
technology_5
ide
to
define
these
rule
in
a
type
quality_attribute_2
environment
we
do
not
need
to
use
connector_data_1
configuration
which
typically
tend
to
be
bulky
technology_2
though
support
connector_data_1
configuration
through
technology_10
technology_11
if
you
prefer
to
use
connector_data_1
for
configure
the
rule
you
even
use
blueprint
connector_data_1
configuration
and
even
a
technology_19
dsl
if
you
be
a
technology_19
lover
it
also
mean
that
you
can
use
your
favorite
technology_5
technology_19
ide
or
even
a
quality_attribute_3
connector_data_1
editor
to
configure
the
rule
the
input
to
this
component_10
can
be
a
comma
delimit
text
a
pojo
plain
old
technology_5
connector_data_4
connector_data_1
be
any
of
the
several
other
technology_17
support
by
technology_2
similarly
the
output
of
the
component_10
can
be
redirect
to
a
to
a
connector_data_2
component_11
or
even
your
pattern_4
screen
for
you
to
pattern_5
the
order
connector_8
to
respective
vendor
these
be
connector_9
the
and
technology_2
support
the
connector_data_2
eip
pattern_3
the
technology_2
be
discus
late
in
the
chapter
technology_2
be
typically
use
with
technology_1
servicemix
technology_1
