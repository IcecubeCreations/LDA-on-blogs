be
one
of
the
most
popular
buzz
word
in
the
of
architecture
there
be
numerous

material
on
the
fundamental
and
benefit
of
pattern_1
but
there
be
very
few
resource
on
how
you
can
use
pattern_1
in
real
world
requirement_7
scenario
in
this

i

go
to
cover
the
key
architectural
concept
of
the
pattern_1
architecture
msa
and
how
you
can
use
those
architectural
principle
in
practice
monolithic
architecture
requirement_7
component_2
be
design
to
facilitate
numerous
requirement_8
requirement
a
give
component_3
offer
hundred
of
requirement_9
and
all
such
requirement_9
be
pile
into
a
single
monolithic
component_3
for
example
erps
crms
and
other
various
component_4
be
build
a
a
monolith
with
several
hundred
of
requirement_9
the
deployment
troubleshoot
quality_attribute_2
and
upgrade
of
such
monstrous
component_2
be
a
nightmare
component_5
orient
architecture
technology_2
be
design
to
overcome
some
of
the
aforementioned
limitation
by
introduce
the
concept
of
a
component_5
an
aggregation
and
grouping
of
similar
requirement_9
offer
from
an
component_3
with
technology_2
a
component_3
be
design
a
a
combination
of
coarse
grain
component_5
however
in
technology_2
the
scope
of
a
component_5
be
very
broad
that
lead
to
complex
and
mammoth
component_6
with
several
dozen
of
requirement_9
along
with
complex
connector_data_1
technology_3
and
technology_4
e
g
all
ws*
technology_4
monolithic
architecture
in
most
requirement_10
component_6
in
pattern_3
be
independent
of
each
other
yet
they
be
quality_attribute_3
in
the
same
runtime
along
with
all
other
component_6

think
about
have
several
web
component_2
that
be
quality_attribute_3
into
the
same
technology_5
instance
similar
to
monolithic
component_3
these
component_6
have
a
habit
of
grow
over
time
by
accumulate
various
requirement_9
literally
that
turn
those
component_2
into
monolithic
glob
that
be
no
different
from
conventional
monolithic
component_2
such
a
erps
the
show
a
retail
component_3
which
comprise
of
multiple
component_5
all
these
component_6
be
quality_attribute_3
into
the
same
component_3
runtime
so
it
s
a
very
quality_attribute_4
example
of
a
monolithic
architecture
here
be
some
of
the
characteristic
of
component_2
base
on
monolithic
architecture
monolithic
component_2
be
design
develop
and
quality_attribute_3
a
a
single
unit
monolithic
component_2
be
overwhelmingly
complex
this
lead
to
nightmare
in
maintain
upgrade
and

feature
it
be
difficult
to
practice
agile
development
and
delivery
methodology
with
monolithic
architecture
it
be
require
to
redeploy
the
entire
component_3
in
order
to
update
a
part
of
it
the
component_3
have
to
be
quality_attribute_2
a
a
single
unit
make
it
difficult
to
manage
conflict
resource
requirement
e
g
one
component_5
require
more
cpu
while
the
other
require
more
memory
one
unstable
component_5
can
bring
the
whole
component_3
down
it
s
really
difficult
to
adopt
technology_6
and
technology_7
a
of
all
the
requirement_9
have
to
build
on
homogeneous
technology_6
technology_7
pattern_1
architecture
the
foundation
of
pattern_1
architecture
msa
be
about
develop
a
single
component_3
a
a
suite
of
small
and
independent
component_6
that
be
run
in
their
own
component_7
develop
and
quality_attribute_3
independently
in
most
of
the
definition
of
pattern_1
architecture
it
be
explain
a
the
component_7
of
segregate
the
component_6
quality_attribute_5
in
the
monolith
into
a
set
of
independent
component_5
however
in
my
opinion
pattern_1
be
not
about
split
the
component_6
quality_attribute_5
in
monolith
into
independent
component_5
the
key
idea
be
that
by
look
at
the
requirement_9
offer
from
the
monolith
we
can
identify
the
require
requirement_8
capability
then
those
requirement_8
capability
can
be
connector_3
a
fully
independent
fine
grain
and
self
contain
micro
component_5
they
might
be
connector_3
on
top
of
different
technology_6
technology_8
and
each
component_5
be
connector_4
a
very
specific
and
limit
requirement_8
scope
therefore
the
online
retail
component_8
scenario
that
we
explain
above
can
be
realize
with
pattern_1
architecture
a
depict
in
the
figure
below
with
pattern_4
architecture
the
retail
component_3
be
connector_3
a
a
suite
of
pattern_1
so
a
you
can
see
below
base
on
requirement_8
requirement
there
be
an
additional
pattern_4
create
from
the
original
set
of
component_6
that
be
there
in
the
monolith
so
it
be
quite
obvious
that
use
pattern_1
architecture
be
something
beyond
the
split
of
the
component_6
in
the
monolith
pattern_1
architecture

s
dive
deep
into
the
key
architectural
principle
of
pattern_1
and
more
importantly

s
focus
on
how
they
can
be
use
in
practice
design
pattern_1
size
scope
and
capability
you
be
build
your
component_3
from
scratch
by
use
pattern_1
architecture
or
you
be
convert
exist
component_3
component_5
into
pattern_1
either
way
it
be
quite
important
that
you
properly
decide
the
size
scope
and
capability
of
the
pattern_1
probably
that
be
the
hard
thing
that
you
initially
encounter
when
you
connector_3
pattern_1
architecture
in
practice

s
discus
some
of
the
key
practical
concern
and
misconception
relate
to
the
size
scope
and
capability
of
pattern_1
line
of

team
size
be
lousy
metric
there
be
several
discussion
on
decide
the
size
of
the
pattern_1
base
on
the
line
of

of
it
implementation
or
it
team
s
size
i
e
two
pizza
team
however
these
be
consider
to
be
very
impractical
and
lousy
metric
because
we
can
still
develop
component_6
with
le

with
two
pizza
team
size
but
totally
violate
the
pattern_4
architectural
principal
micro
be
a
bit
mislead
term
most
developer
tend
to
think
that
they
should
try
to
make
the
component_5
a
small
a
possible
this
be
a
misconception
pattern_3
component_9
in
the
pattern_3
component_9
component_6
be
often
connector_3
a
monolithic
glob
with
the
support
for
several
dozen
of

requirement_9
so
have
technology_2

component_6
and
rebranding
them
a
pattern_1
be
not
go
to
give
you
any
benefit
of
pattern_1
architecture
so
then
how
should
we
properly
design
component_6
in
pattern_1
architecture
guideline
for
design
pattern_1
single
responsibility
principle
srp
have
a

for
a
pattern_4
help
u
to
meet
agility
in
development
and
delivery
of
component_5
during
the
design
phase
of
the
pattern_1
we
should
find
their
boundary
and
align
them
with
requirement_8
capability
also

a

component_9
in
domain
drive
design
make
sure
the
pattern_1
design
ensure
the
agile
independent
development
and
deployment
of
the
component_5
our
focus
should
be
on
the
scope
of
the
pattern_4
but
not
about
make
the
component_5
small
the
right
size
of
the
component_5
should
be
the
require
size
to
facilitate
a
give
requirement_8
capability
unlike
component_5
in
technology_2
a
give
pattern_4
should
have
very
few

requirement_9
and
a
quality_attribute_6
connector_data_1
technology_3
it
be
often
a
quality_attribute_4
practice
to
start
with
relatively
broad
component_5
boundary
to
begin
with
and
then
refactor
to
small
one
base
on
requirement_8
requirement
a
time
go
on
in
our
retail
use
requirement_10
you
can
find
that
we
have
split
the
requirement_9
of
the
monolith
into
four
different
pattern_1
namely
inventory
accounting
ship
and
component_10
they
be
connector_4
a
limit
but
focus
requirement_8
scope
so
that
each
component_5
be
fully
decouple
from
each
other
and
ensure
the
agility
in
development
and
deployment
pattern_5
in
pattern_1

of
different
processor
component_11
be
invoke
use
connector_data_2
or
technology_9
level
connector_data_3
in
technology_2
this
be
shift
towards
a
much
more
loosely
couple
web
component_5
level
connector_data_1
which
be
primarily
base
on
technology_10
on
top
of
different
technology_11
such
a
technology_12
technology_13
webservices
with
several
dozen
of
and
complex
connector_data_1
schema
be
a
key
resistive
force
for
the
popularity
of
web
component_5
for
pattern_1
architecture
it
be
require
to
have
a
quality_attribute_6
and
lightweight
pattern_5
mechanism
pattern_6
pattern_5
rest
technology_14
for

pattern_5
component_12
expect
a
timely

from
the
component_5
and
wait
till
it
connector_2

the
unanimous

when

connector_3
a

you
need
to

we
barely

technology_26
be
use

but
a
we
all

technology_26
be
not
the
ideal
solution
for
define
pattern_1
contract
a
technology_26
be
insanely
complex
and
tightly
couple
to
technology_22
since
we
build
pattern_1
on
top
of
a
pattern_7
architectural
style
we
can
use
the
same
pattern_7
component_13
definition
technique
to
define
the
contract
of
pattern_1
therefore
pattern_1
use
the
technology_4
pattern_7
component_13
definition
technology_9
such
a
technology_25
and
raml
to
define
the

quality_attribute_7
pattern_1
inter
component_5
component_7
connector_8
in
pattern_1
architecture
the
component_2
be
build
a
a
suite
of
independent
component_5
so
in
order
to
realize
a
requirement_8
use
requirement_10
it
be
require
to
have
the
connector_8
connector_data_7
between
different
pattern_1
component_7
that
s
why
inter
component_5
component_7
connector_8
between
pattern_1
be
such
a
vital
aspect
in
pattern_3
implementation
the
inter
component_5
connector_8
between
component_6
be
facilitate
with
an
requirement_7
component_5
bus
esb
and
most
of
the
requirement_8
component_14
reside
in
the
intermediate
pattern_9
connector_data_1
connector_9
transformation
and
pattern_10
however
pattern_1
architecture
promote
to
eliminate
the
central
connector_data_1
bus
esb
and
move
the
smart
ness
or
requirement_8
component_14
to
the
component_6
and
component_12

a
smart

since
pattern_1
use
technology_4
technology_11
such
a
technology_12
technology_17
etc
the
requirement
of
quality_attribute_7
with
a
disparate
technology_11
be
minimal
when
it
come
to
the
connector_8
among
pattern_1
another
alternative
approach
in
pattern_4
connector_8
be
to
use
a
lightweight
connector_data_1
bus
or
gateway
with
minimal
connector_10
capability
and
act
a
a
dumb
pattern_11
with
no
requirement_8
component_14
connector_3
on
the
gateway
base
on
these
style
there
be
several
connector_8
pattern_12
that
have
emerge
in
pattern_1
architecture
point
to
point
style
invoke
component_6
directly
in
point
to
point
style
the
entirety
of
the
connector_data_1
connector_10
component_14
reside
on
each
and
the
component_6
can
connector_11
directly
each
pattern_4
connector_12
a
pattern_7
component_15
and
a
give
pattern_4
or
an
external
component_12
can
invoke
another
pattern_4
through
it
pattern_7
technology_27
inter
component_5
connector_8
with
point
to
point
connector_13
obviously
this
component_16
work
for
relatively
quality_attribute_6
pattern_1
base
component_3
but
a
the
number
of
component_6
increase
this
will
become
overwhelmingly
complex
after
all
that
s
the
exact
reason
for
use
esb
in
the
traditional
pattern_3
implementation
to
connector_2
rid
of
the
messy
point
to
point
requirement_5
connector_14

s
try
to
summarize
the
key
drawback
of
the
point
to
point
style
for
pattern_4
connector_8
the
non
functional
requirement
such
a
end
component_17
pattern_13
throttle
pattern_14
etc
have
to
be
connector_3
at
each
and
every
pattern_4
level
a
a
connector_data_8
of
duplicate
common
requirement_9
each
pattern_4
implementation
can
become
complex
there
be
no
control
at
all
of
the
connector_8
between
the
component_6
and
component_18
even
for
pattern_14
trace
or
pattern_15
often
the
direct
connector_8
style
be
consider
a
a
pattern_4
anti
pattern_12
for
large
quality_attribute_2
pattern_4
implementation
therefore
for
complex
pattern_1
use
requirement_10
rather
than
have
point
to
point
connector_13
or
a
central
esb
we
could
have
a
lightweight
central
pattern_5
bus
which
can
provide
an
abstraction
pattern_9
for
the
pattern_1
and
that
can
be
use
to
connector_3
various
non
functional
capability
this
style
be

a
component_13
gateway
style
technology_27
gateway
style
the
key
idea
behind
the
component_13
gateway
style
be
that
use
a
lightweight
connector_data_1
gateway
a
the
entry
point
for
all
the
component_12
component_19
and
connector_3
the
common
non
functional
requirement
at
the
gateway
level
in
general
an
component_13
gateway
allow
you
to
connector_15
a
manage
component_13
over
rest
technology_12
therefore
here
we
can
connector_6
our
requirement_8
requirement_9
which
be
connector_3
a
pattern_1
through
the
technology_27
gw
a
manage
apis
in
fact
this
be
a
combination
of
pattern_1
architecture
and
technology_27
requirement_11
which
give
you
the
best
of
both
world
all
pattern_1
be
connector_16
through
an
technology_27
gw
in
our
retail
requirement_8
scenario
a
depict
in
figure
above
all
the
pattern_1
be
connector_16
through
an
technology_27
gw
and
that
be
the
single
entry
point
for
all
the
component_12
if
a
pattern_4
want
to
connector_15
another
pattern_4
that
also
need
to
be
do
through
the
technology_27
gw
technology_27
gw
style
give
you
the
follow
advantage
ability
to
provide
the
require
abstraction
at
the
gateway
level
for
the
exist
pattern_1
for
example
rather
than
provide

over

it
establish

of

tell

what

and
the

what
they

there

the

what
do

in

really

in

the
pattern_1
be
build
a

so
there
be
no

for
define
a

for

design
and
development
so
we
can
summarize
the
decentralized
governance
capability
of
pattern_1
a
follow
in
pattern_1
architecture
there
be
no
requirement
to
have

governance
pattern_1
can
make

and
component_5

in

the
number
of
pattern_1
that
you
need
to
deal
with
be
quite
high
and
also
their
location
connector_20
dynamically
owe
to
the
rapid
and
agile
development
deployment
nature
of
pattern_1
therefore
you
need
to
find
the
location
of
a
pattern_4
during
the
runtime
the
solution
to
this
problem
be
to
use
a
component_5
registry
component_5
registry
component_5
registry
hold
the
pattern_1
instance
and
their
location
pattern_4
instance
be
register
with
the
component_5
registry
on

and
deregistered
on

the
component_24
can
find
the
quality_attribute_5
pattern_1
and
their
location
through
component_5
registry
component_5
discovery
to
find
the
quality_attribute_5
pattern_1
and
their
location
we
need
to
have
a
component_5

mechanism
there
be
two
type
of
component_5
discovery
mechanism
component_12
side
discovery
and
component_26

s
have
a
close
look
at
those
component_5

mechanism
component_12
side

—
in
this
approach
the
component_12
or
the
technology_27
gw
obtain
the

of
a

a

component_12

component_26

—
with
this
approach

play

key
requirement
ability

un

a

more

quickly
failure
in

pattern_4
must
not
affect
any
of

an

that

developer

quality_attribute_3

provide
a
great
way
to
quality_attribute_3
pattern_1
connector_4
the
above
requirement
the
key
step
involve
be
a

package
the

a
a

image
quality_attribute_3
each

a
a

quality_attribute_9
be
do
base
on
connector_20
the
number
of
container
instance
build
quality_attribute_3
and
start
pattern_4
will
be
much
fast
a
we
be
use
technology_33
container
which
be
much
fast
than
a
regular
vm
technology_31
be
extend
technology_33
s
capability
by
allow

container
across

component_28
offer
co
location
of
container
component_5
discovery
and
pattern_22
control
a
you
can
see
most
of
these
feature
be
essential
in
our
pattern_1
component_9
too
hence
use
technology_31
on
top
of
technology_33
for
pattern_1
deployment
have
become
an
extremely
powerful
approach
especially
for
large
quality_attribute_2
pattern_1
deployment
build
and
quality_attribute_3
pattern_1
a
container
in
the
figure
above
it
show
an
overview
of
the
deployment
of
the
pattern_1
of
the
retail
component_3
each
pattern_4
instance
be
quality_attribute_3
a
a
container
and
there
be
two
container
per
each
component_28
you
can
arbitrarily
connector_20
the
number
of
container
that
you
run
on
a
give
component_28
quality_attribute_1
quality_attribute_10
pattern_1
be
a
quite
common
requirement
when
you
use
pattern_1
in
real
world
scenario
before
jump
into
pattern_1
quality_attribute_1

s
have
a
quick
look
at
how
we
normally
connector_3
quality_attribute_1
at
the
monolithic
component_3
level
in
a
typical
monolithic
component_3
the
quality_attribute_1
be
about
find
that
who
be
the
caller
what
can
the
caller
do
and
how
do
we
propagate
that
connector_data_11
this
be
usually
connector_3
at
a
common
quality_attribute_1
component_11
which
be
at
the
begin
of
the
connector_data_4
handle
chain
and
that
component_11
populate
the
require
connector_data_11
with
the
use
of
an
underlie
component_17
pattern_23
or
component_17
component_10
so
can
we
directly
pattern_24
this
pattern_12
into
the
pattern_1
architecture
yes
but
that
require
a
quality_attribute_1
component_11
connector_3
at
each
pattern_1
level
which
be
talk
to
a
centralized
connector_26
component_17
pattern_23
and
connector_27
the
require
connector_data_11
that
s
be
a
very
tedious
approach
of
solve
the
pattern_1
quality_attribute_1
problem
instead
we
can
leverage
the
widely
use
technology_27
quality_attribute_1
technology_4
such
a
oauth2
and
technology_34
connector_28
to
find
a
quality_attribute_4
solution
to
our
pattern_1
quality_attribute_1
problem
before
we
dive
deep
into
that
me
summarize
the
purpose
of
each
technology_4
and
how
we
can
use
them
oauth2
be
an
connector_22
delegation
technology_11
the
component_12
pattern_25
with
the
pattern_26
component_26
and
connector_29
an
opaque
connector_data_12
which
be

a
connector_22
connector_data_12
an
connector_22
connector_data_12
have
zero
connector_data_11
about
the
component_17
component_12
it
only
have
a
reference
to
the
component_17
connector_data_11
that
can
only
be
connector_27
by
the
pattern_26
component_26
hence
this
be

a
a
by
reference
connector_data_12
and
it
be
quality_attribute_11
to
use
this
connector_data_12
even
in
the
requirement_13
internet
technology_34
connector_28
behave
similarly
to
oauth
but
in
addition
to
the
connector_22
connector_data_12
the
pattern_26
component_26
issue
an
connector_data_12
which
contain
connector_data_11
about
the
component_17
this
be
often
connector_3
by
a
jwt
technology_17
web
connector_data_12
and
that
be
sign
by
an
pattern_26
component_26
so
this
ensure
the
trust
between
the
pattern_26
component_26
and
the
component_12
jwt
connector_data_12
be
therefore

a
a
by
requirement_14
connector_data_12
a
it
contain
the
connector_data_11
of
the
component_17
and
obviously
be
not
quality_attribute_11
to
use
it
outside
the
internal
requirement_13
now

s
see
how
we
can
use
these
technology_4
to
quality_attribute_10
pattern_1
in
our
retail
example
pattern_4
quality_attribute_1
with
oauth2
and
technology_34
connector_28
a
show
in
the
figure
above
these
be
the
key
step
involve
in
connector_21
pattern_1
quality_attribute_1
leave
pattern_13
to
oauth
and
the
technology_34
connector_28
component_26
pattern_26
component_26
so
that
pattern_1
successfully
provide
connector_22
give
someone
have
the
right
to
use
the
connector_data_10
use
the
technology_27
gw
style
in
which
there
be
a
single
entry
point
for
all
the
component_12
connector_data_4
the
component_12
connector_30
to
the
pattern_26
component_26
and
obtain
the
connector_22
connector_data_12
by
reference
connector_data_12
then
connector_17
the
connector_22
connector_data_12
to
the
technology_27
gw
along
with
the
connector_data_4
connector_data_12
translation
at
the
gateway
technology_27
gw
extract
the
connector_22
connector_data_12
and
connector_25
it
to
the
pattern_26
component_26
to
connector_27
the
jwt
by
requirement_14
connector_data_12
then
gw
pass
this
jwt
along
with
the
connector_data_4
to
the
pattern_1
pattern_9
jwts
contain
the
necessary
connector_data_11
to
help
in
connector_31
component_17
component_29
etc
if
each
component_5
can
understand
a
technology_24
web
connector_data_12
then
you
have
quality_attribute_12
your
identity
mechanism
which
be
allow
you
to
transport
identity
throughout
your
component_8
at
each
pattern_4
pattern_9
we
can
have
a
component_11
that
component_30
the
jwt
which
be
a
quite
trivial
implementation
transaction
how
about
the
transaction
support
in
pattern_1
in
fact
support
quality_attribute_12
transaction
across
multiple
pattern_1
be
an
exceptionally
complex
connector_data_13
the
pattern_4
architecture
itself
encourage
the
transaction
le
coordination
between
component_5
the
idea
be
that
a
give
component_5
be
fully
self
contain
and
base
on
the
single
responsibility
principle
the
need
to
have
quality_attribute_12
transaction
across
multiple
pattern_1
be
often
a
symptom
of
a
design
flaw
in
pattern_4
architecture
and
usually
can
be
sort
out
by
refactoring
the
scope
of
pattern_1
however
if
there
be
a
mandatory
requirement
to
have
quality_attribute_12
transaction
across
multiple
component_5
then
such
scenario
can
be
realize
with
the
introduction
of
compensate

at
each
pattern_4
level
the
key
idea
be
a
give
pattern_4
be
base
on
the
single
responsibility
principle
and
if
a
give
pattern_4
fail
to
connector_32
a
give

we
can
consider
that
a
a
failure
of
that
entire
pattern_4
then
all
the
other
upstream
have
to
be
undo
by
invoke
the
respective
compensate
of
those
pattern_1
design
for
failure
pattern_4
architecture
introduce
a
disperse
set
of
component_6
and
compare
to
a
monolithic
design
that
increase
the
possibility
of
have
failure
at
each
component_5
level
a
give
pattern_4
can
fail
due
to
requirement_13
issue
unavailability
of
the
underlie
resource
etc
an
unavailable
or
unresponsive
pattern_4
should
not
bring
the
whole
pattern_1
base
component_3
down
thus
pattern_1
should
be
fault
tolerant
be
able
to
recover
when
that
be
possible
and
the
component_12
have
to
handle
it
gracefully
also
since
component_6
can
fail
at
any
time
it
s
important
to
be
able
to
detect
real
time
pattern_14
the
failure
quickly
and
if
possible
automatically
restore
the
component_5
there
be
several
commonly
use
pattern_12
in
handle
error
in
a
pattern_1
component_9
circuit
breaker
when
you
be
do
an
external
connector_data_3
to
a
pattern_4
you
configure
a
fault
pattern_14
component_11
with
each
invocation
and
when
the
failure
reach
a
certain
threshold
then
that
component_11
stop
any
further
invocation
of
the
component_5
trip
the
circuit
after
a
certain
number
of
connector_data_9
in
open
state
which
you
can
configure
connector_20
the
circuit
back
to
close
state
this
pattern_12
be
quite
useful
to
avoid
unnecessary
resource
consumption
connector_data_4
delay
due
to
timeouts
and
also
give
u
to
chance
to
pattern_14
the
component_8
base
on
the
active
open
circuit
state
bulkhead
a
pattern_4
component_3
comprise
of
the
number
of
pattern_1
the
failure
of
one
part
of
the
pattern_1
base
component_3
should
not
affect
the
rest
of
the
component_3
bulkhead
pattern_12
be
about
isolate
different
part
of
your
component_3
so
that
a
failure
of
a
component_5
in
the
component_3
do
not
affect
any
of
the
other
component_5
timeout
the
timeout
pattern_12
be
a
mechanism
which
be
allow
you
to
stop
wait
for
a
connector_5
from
the
pattern_4
when
you
think
that
it
win
t
come
here
you
can
configure
the
time
interval
that
you
wish
to
wait
so
where
and
how
do
we
use
these
pattern_12
with
pattern_1
in
most
requirement_10
most
of
these
pattern_12
be
applicable
at
the
gateway
level
which
mean
when
the
pattern_1
be
not
quality_attribute_5
or
not
respond
at
the
gateway
level
we
can
decide
whether
to
connector_17
the
connector_data_4
to
the
pattern_4
use
circuit
breaker
or
timeout
pattern_12
also
it
s
quite
important
to
have
pattern_12
such
a
bulkhead
connector_3
at
the
gateway
level
a
it
s
the
single
entry
point
for
all
the
component_12
connector_data_4
so
a
failure
in
a
give
component_5
should
not
affect
the
invocation
of
the
other
pattern_1
in
addition
gateway
can
be
use
a
the
central
point
that
we
can
obtain
the
status
and
pattern_14
of
each
pattern_4
a
each
pattern_1
be
invoke
through
the
gateway
pattern_1
requirement_7
requirement_5
component_13
requirement_11
and
beyond
we
have
discusse
various
characteristic
of
pattern_1
architecture
and
how
you
could
connector_3
them
in
the
modern
requirement_7
it
landscape
however
we
should
keep
in
mind
that
pattern_1
be
not
a
panacea
the
blind
adaptation
of
buzzword
concept
be
not
go
to
solve
your
real
requirement_7
it
problem
a
you
have
see
throughout
this

there
be
quite
a
lot
of
advantage
of
pattern_1
and
we
should
leverage
but
we
also
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
it
be
not
realistic
to
solve
all
the
requirement_7
it
problem
with
microservics
for
instance
pattern_1
architecture
promote
to
eliminate
esb
a
the
central
bus
but
when
it
come
to
real
world
it
there
be
quite
a
lot
of
exist
component_3
component_5
which
be
not
base
on
pattern_1
so
to
quality_attribute_7
with
them
we
need
some
sort
of
requirement_5
bus
so
ideally
a
hybrid
approach
of
pattern_1
and
other
requirement_7
architectural
concept
such
a
requirement_5
would
be
more
realistic
i
will
discus
them
further
in
a
separate

hope
this
give
you
a
much
clear
idea
of
how
you
can
use
pattern_1
in
your
requirement_7
