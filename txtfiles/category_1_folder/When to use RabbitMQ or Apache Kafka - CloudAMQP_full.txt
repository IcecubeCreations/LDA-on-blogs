i
want
to
stop
you
right
there
this
will
discus
both
from
a
broad
perspective
it
have
focus
be
on
the
requirement_2
offer
by
both
component_1
and
will
guide
you
to
make
a
quality_attribute_1
decision
regard
which
component_2
to
use
when
some
on
the
web
make
technology_2
technology_3
shine
in

of
technology_1
and
others
do
the
opposite
a
lot
of
u
could
plead
guilty
to
listen
to
the
hype
and
run
with
the
crowd
i
feel
that
it
s
important
to
that
the
decision
of
whether
to
go
with
technology_1
or
technology_3
be
dependent
on
the
requirement
of
your
project
and
a
true
comparison
can
only
be
make
if
you
have
use
them
both
with
the
correct
setup
in

fit
scenario
84codes
and
i
have
be
in
the
requirement_3
for
a
long
time
provide

solution
for
both
technology_1
through
the
component_4
cloudamqp
and
technology_2
technology_3
through
the
component_4
cloudkarafka
since
i
have
see
so
many
use
requirement_4
and
different
component_5
setup
by
both
technology_4

cloudkarafka
component_6
i
feel
i
can
authoritatively
answer
use
requirement_4
question
base
on
my
experience
on
both
technology_1
and
technology_2
technology_3
in
this
my
mission
be
to
connector_2
insight
base
on
the
many
developer
to
developer
chat
i
have
have
over
the
year
and
to
try
to
convey
their
think
about
why
they
be
choose
a
specific
connector_data_1
pattern_1
component_4
over
another
the
terminology
use
in
this
include
a

component_7
be
a

and
this
“queue”
in

be
refer
to
a

to
simplify
the
connector_data_2
in
the
i
will
refer

instead
of
switch
to

all
the
time
a

be
often

a

again
i
will
refer
to
connector_data_3
in
order
to
simplify
the
connector_data_2
here
when
i
connector_4
about
a

you
can
think
of
it
a

an

chief
among

benefit
be
the

if
you
think
that
your
component_13
will
not
consistently
keep
up
with
the

we
recommend
that
you
enable
lazy

might
end
up
with

in

you

your

each

in

connector_11
connector_data_3
from
the
component_7
the
connector_data_1
component_17
be
spread
across

so
quality_attribute_13
up

down
in

can
be
do
by
simply
and
remove
component_20
in

the
way
to
quality_attribute_10

be
by
use

component_10
where
each

in

you
can
use

quality_attribute_13
pattern_1
in
the
answer
at

i
connector_4
“kafka
be
build
from
the

up
with

quality_attribute_13
more
component_24
in
mind
while
technology_1
be
mostly
design
for
vertical
quality_attribute_13
more
power
”
this
part
of
the
answer
be
give
connector_data_2
about
the
component_25
run
technology_3
or
technology_1
horizontal
quality_attribute_13
do
not
always
give
you
a
quality_attribute_1
requirement_9
in
technology_1
the
best
requirement_9
level
be
achieve
with
vertical
quality_attribute_13
more
power
horizontal
quality_attribute_13
be
possible
in
technology_1
but
that
mean
that
you
must
set
up
cluster
between
your
technology_10
which
will
probably
slow
down
your
setup
in
technology_3
you
can
quality_attribute_14
by
more
technology_10
to
the
cluster
or
by
more
component_10
to
topic
this
be
sometimes
easy
than
to
cpu
or
memory
into
an
exist
component_24
you
have
to
do
in
technology_1
many
people
and
include
confluent
be
talk
about
how
great
technology_3
be
at
quality_attribute_14
and
sure
technology_3
can
quality_attribute_14
further
than
technology_1
since
there
will
always
be
a
limit
on
how
beefy
the
component_25
be
that
you
can
buy
however
in
this
requirement_4
we
need
to
remember
the
reason
why
we
be
use
a
pattern_1
you
probably
have
a
connector_data_1
volume
that
both
technology_3
and
technology_1
can
support
without
any
problem
at
all
and
most
of
u
t
deal
with
a
quality_attribute_14
where
technology_1
run
out
of
space
requirement_5
compaction
a
feature
that
be
worth
mention
in
technology_2
technology_3
that
do
not
exist
in
technology_1
be
the
requirement_5
compaction
strategy
requirement_5
compaction
ensure
that
technology_3
always
retain
the
last
requirement_11
for
each
connector_data_1
key
within
the
component_7
for
a
single
topic
component_10
technology_3
simply
keep
the
late
version
of
a
connector_data_1
and
delete
the
old
version
with
the
same
key
requirement_5
compaction
can
be
see
a
a
way
of
use
technology_3
a
a
component_21
you
set
the
retention
period
to
“forever”
or
enable
requirement_5
compaction
on
a
topic
and
voila
the
connector_data_4
be
component_18
forever
an
example
of
where
we
use
requirement_5
compaction
be
when
we
be
show
the
late
status
of
one
cluster
among
thousand
of
cluster
run
instead
of
connector_32
whether
a
cluster
be
respond
or
not
all
the
time
we

such
a
how

have
a

that
you

and
you
can
pattern_8

rat
and
connector_23
connector_30
connector_data_3
manually
for

we
have
a
number
of
open

for

and
also
some
commercial
one
offer
administration
and
pattern_7
requirement_2
connector_data_2
about
different
pattern_7
technology_11
for
technology_3
connector_34
or
connector_35
connector_data_3
be
connector_34
from
technology_1
to
the
component_20
it’s
important
to
configure
a
prefetch
limit
in
order
to
prevent
overwhelm
the
component_20
if
connector_data_3
arrive
at
the
component_7
fast
than
the
component_13
can
component_17
them
component_13
can
also
connector_35
connector_data_3
from
technology_1
but
it’s
not
recommend
technology_3
on
the
other
hand
u
a
connector_35
component_29
a
describe
early
where
component_13
connector_data_6
pattern_6
of
connector_data_3
from
a
give
offset
license
technology_1
be
originally
create
by
rabbit
technology_12
ltd
the
project
become
part
of
pivotal
in
the
component_28
for
technology_1
be
release
under
the
mozilla
license
the
license
have
never
connector_36
a
of
nov
technology_3
be
originally
create
at
linkedin
it
be
give
open
component_28
status
and
pass
to
the
technology_2
foundation
in
technology_2
technology_3
be
cover
by
the
technology_2
license
some
of
the
component_30
often
use
in
combination
with
technology_3
be
cover
by
another
license
connector_3
confluent
license
e
g
rest
pattern_10
schema
registry
and
ksl
this
license
still
allow
people
to
freely
download
modify
and
redistribute
the
very
much
technology_2
do
but
it
do
not
allow
anyone
to
provide
the
a
a
pattern_11
offer
both
license
be
free
and
open
component_28
license
if
technology_3
connector_37
the
license
again
to
something
even
strict
this
be
where
technology_1
have
the
advantage
a
it
can
easily
be
replace
by
another
technology_8
pattern_1
while
technology_3
cannot
complexity
personally
i
think
it
be
easy
to
connector_1
start
with
technology_1
and
find
it
easy
to
work
with
and
a
a
requirement_8
of
ours
say
we
didn
t
spend
any
time
technology_1
and
it
work
for
year
it
definitely
reduce
ton
of
operational
cost
during
doordash
s
hyper
growth
zhaobang
liu
doordash
in
my
opinion
the
architecture
in
technology_3
bring
more
complexity
a
it
do
include
more
concept
such
a
topic
component_10
connector_data_1
offset
etc
from
the
very
begin
you
have
to
be
familiar
with
component_20
group
and
how
to
handle
offset
a
technology_3
and
technology_1
operator
we
feel
that
it
s
a
bit
more
complicate
to
handle
failure
in
technology_3
the
component_17
to
recover
or
fix
something
be
usually
more
time
connector_38
and
bit
more
messy
the
technology_3
ecosystem
technology_3
be
not
a
pattern_1
it’s
a
connector_7
component_31
and
there
be
many
technology_11
quality_attribute_8
that
be
easy
to
quality_attribute_15
with
technology_3
outside
the
distribution
the
technology_3
ecosystem
consist
of
technology_3
core
technology_3
connector_9
technology_3
connector_6
technology_3
pattern_12
pattern_10
and
the
schema
registry
please
note
that
most
of
the
additional
technology_11
of
the
technology_3
ecosystem
come
from
confluent
and
be
not
part
of
technology_2
the
quality_attribute_1
thing
with
all
these
technology_11
be
that
you
can
configure
a
huge
component_2
before
you
need
to
connector_4
a
single
line
of
technology_3
connector_6
you
quality_attribute_15
other
component_1
with
technology_3
you
can
a
connector_data_4
component_28
that
allow
you
to
connector_11
connector_data_4
from
that
component_28
and
component_18
it
in
technology_3
or
the
other
way
around
and
have
all
connector_data_4
in
a
topic
connector_10
to
another
component_2
for
component_17
or
storage
there
be
many
possibility
with
use
technology_3
connector_6
and
it
s
easy
to
connector_1
start
since
there
be
already
a
lot
of
connector
quality_attribute_8
the
technology_3
pattern_12
pattern_10
give
you
the
opportunity
to
connector_30
metadata
from
a
cluster
and
produce
and
connector_11
connector_data_3
over
a
quality_attribute_3
pattern_12
technology_13
this
feature
can
easily
be
enable
from
the
control
panel
for
your
cluster
common
use
requirement_4
technology_1
vs
technology_2
technology_3
there
have
be
a
lot
of
connector_data_2
about
what
one
component_2
can
or
can’t
do
here
be
two
use
requirement_4
describe
how
i
and
many
of
our
requirement_8
have
be
think
about
and
make
a
decision
on
which
component_2
to
use
of
we
have
also
see
situation
where
a
requirement_8
have
build
a
component_2
where
one
component_2
should
have
be
use
instead
of
the
other
one
use
requirement_4
for
technology_1
in
general
if
you
want
a
quality_attribute_3
traditional
pattern_13
connector_data_1
pattern_1
the
obvious
choice
be
technology_1
a
it
will
most
probably
quality_attribute_14
more
than
you
will
ever
need
it
to
quality_attribute_14
i
would
have
chosen
technology_1
if
my
requirement
be
quality_attribute_3
enough
to
deal
with
component_2
connector_17
through
pattern_9
component_7
and
where
retention
and
connector_7
be
not
a
requirement
there
be
two
situation
where
i
would
choose
technology_1
for
long
run
connector_data_7
when
i
need
to
run
quality_attribute_2
background
and
for
connector_17
and
requirement_12
within
and
between
component_5
i
e
a
middleman
between
pattern_2
where
a
component_2
simply
need
to
connector_39
another
part
of
the
component_2
to
start
to
work
on
a
connector_data_7
order
handle
in
a
webshop
order
place
update
order
status
connector_23
order
payment
etc
long
run
connector_data_8
connector_data_1
component_8
enable
pattern_14
component_17
mean
that
they
allow
you
to
put
a
connector_data_1
in
a
component_7
without
component_17
it
immediately
technology_1
be
ideal
for
long
run
connector_data_7
an
example
can
be
find
in
our
technology_1
beginner
guide
which
follow
a
classic
scenario
where
a
web
component_5
allow
component_27
to
connector_40
connector_data_2
to
a
web
the
will
handle
this
connector_data_2
generate
a
pdf
and
it
back
to
the
component_6
complete
the
connector_data_8
in
this
example
requirement_4
take
several
second
which
be
one
of
the
reason
why
a
connector_data_1
component_7
will
be
use
many
of
our
requirement_8
technology_1
component_8
serve
a
bus
allow
web
component_32
to
respond
quickly
to
connector_data_9
instead
of
be
force
to
perform
computationally
intensive
connector_data_8
on
the
spot
take
softonic
a
an
example
they
use
technology_1
in
an
pattern_15
pattern_2
architecture
that
support
million
component_27
a

middleman
in
a
pattern_16

technology_1
be
also
use
by
many
requirement_8
for
pattern_16
architecture
where
it
serve
a
a
mean
of
connector_28
between
component_5
avoid

pass
connector_data_1
you
can
for
example
connector_41
how

it’s
ideal
for

the
use
of

accord
to
the
creator
of
technology_2
technology_3
the
original
use
requirement_4
for
technology_3
be
to
track

include
component_34
pattern_17
search
connector_40
or
other
action
component_27
take
this
kind
of

track
often
require
a
very
high
volume
of

since
connector_data_3
be
generate
for

action
and
for

component_6
many
of
these
activity
in
fact
all
of
the
