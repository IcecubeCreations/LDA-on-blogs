introduction
you
can’t
create
innovative

without
quality_attribute_1
connector_data_1
collection
to
support

connector_data_1

technology_1
be

component_2
requirement_3
and
requirement_4
requirement_4
require
connector_data_1
to
how
to
analyze
and
respond
to
your
connector_data_2
it’s
a
lot
how
child
need
book

and

to
increase
their
knowledge
base

technology_1
develop
very
quickly
and
sometimes
you
need
a
little
help
with
your
connector_data_1
collection
we’ve
connector_3
elsewhere
about
our
“four
ps”
approach
to
speech
connector_data_1
collection
but
here’s
where
we’ll
talk
about
it
all
from
more
of
a
bird’s
eye
pattern_1
connector_data_1
collection
for
emerge
technology_1
the
basic
step
identify
the
purpose
of
your
emerge
technology_1
the
component_2
begin
by
establish
the
objective
of
the
emerge
technology_1
you’re
work
on
if
objective
aren’t
properly
identify
your
team
could
miss
connector_4
the
necessary
connector_data_1
if
you’re
develop
a
voice
assistant
for
example
you’ll
need
to
gather
a
bunch
of
voice
command
connector_data_1
begin
with
wake
word
and
move
on
to
more
specific
voice
command
in
target
technology_2
and
dialect
properly
identify
the
objective
lead
to
connector_4
the
right
connector_data_1
from
there
you
set
up
the
methodology
in
a
way
that
fulfill
the
need
of
the
require
connector_data_1
narrow
your
use
requirement_1
once
you’ve
identify
what
your
technology_1
be
go
to
do
determine
how
wide
to
cast
your
component_4
net
gather
connector_data_1
accordingly
from
target
technology_2
and
dialect
a
well
a
from
different
age
and
gender
set
the
parameter
for
this
comprehensive
dataset
by
narrow
the
use
requirement_1
to
beforehand
you
could
have
specific
scripted
utterance
you
want
to
connector_1
or
you
base
the
connector_data_1
collection
on
conversational
scenario
often
connector_5
natural
technology_2
connector_data_1
for
an
utterance
base
audio
connector_data_1
collection
for
a
voice
activate
home
speaker
script
the
phrase
for
example
connector_6
people
to
say
“play
elvis’
top
song
”
in
the
requirement_1
of
natural
technology_2
connector_data_1
collection
allow
component_5
to
determine
the
output
only
give
them
an
objective
in
mind
the
objective
could
be
“play
music
specific
song
genre
albums”
the
connector_data_1
will
reflect
how
different
people
ask
for
the
same
thing
in
different
way
component_4
one
could
say
“play
x
song”
whereas
component_4
two
say
“i
want
to
listen
to
x
song”
a
home
speaker
therefore
should
be
ready
for
a
variety
of
connector_data_2
select
your
subject
connector_data_1
collection
need
to
include
the
right
accent
technology_2
dialect
and
gender
ratio
base
on
the
target
geography
for
instance
if
your
target
geography
be
the
u
a
diverse
set
of
english
accent
with
an
even
gender
split
provide
a
quality_attribute_3
balance
of
connector_data_1
consider
the
component_6
setup
your
connector_data_1
need
–
audio
image
video
distance
or
other
–
dictate
the
component_7
require
to
connector_1
the
connector_data_1
as
the
quality
of
the
component_6
component_7
a
well
if
the
purpose
of
the
speech
connector_data_1
collection
project
be
generate
natural
speech
the
audio
quality
not
be
all
that
important
however
if
the
purpose
be
acoustic
train
only
a
well
design
comprehensive
setup
will
the
desire
connector_data_1
create
the
setup
with
the
technology’s
end
use
in
mind
for
an
in
car
voice
assistant
where
do
the
microphone
need
to
be
would
there
be
several
would
it
also
need
to
see
your
gesture
place
the
component_6
component_7
in
a
way
that
capture
the
real
use
requirement_1
of
the
develop
technology_1
clean
connector_data_1
vs
raw
connector_data_1
find
a
balance
between
clean
connector_data_1
and
raw
connector_data_1
clean
connector_data_1
be
the
ideal
situation
the
connector_data_1
be
component_6
perfectly
or
clean
up
to
be
perfect
this
can
involve
remove
the
background
noise
of
a
component_6
so
the
speaker
be
clear
or
crop
out
a
stop
sign
so
there’s
nothing
in
the
background
raw
connector_data_1
would
include
keep
all
the
“dirt”
in
the
connector_data_1
dirt
could
include
the
tree
a
in
the
image
above
or
the
sound
of
a
motorbike
in
an
audio
component_6
since
the
connector_data_1
be
not
cleanse
it
can
be
use
for
the
purpose
of
teaching
technology_1
what
to
ignore
or
possibly
even
pay
attention
to
in
different
situation
label
the
connector_data_1
annotation
or
not
be
necessary
for
your
specific
use
requirement_1
but
for
your
speech
recognition
requirement_4
project
to
reach
it
full
potential
it
must
pass
through
a
series
of
requirement_3
component_2
one
of
those
stage
be
speech
connector_data_1
annotation
and
the
same
can
be
say
of
text
connector_data_1
don’t
forget
to
test
connector_4
a
preliminary
set
of
connector_data_1
to
test
be
an
important
step
these
preliminary
set
can
run
in
house
before
use
real
participant
test
the

collection
mean

time
by
fix
mistake
before
hit
the
for
the
real
connector_data_1
collection
phase
when
use
and
unfamiliar
technology_1
or
thing
can
often
go
wrong
the
fail
to
component_6
the
hardware
wasn’t
in
optimal
position
or
maybe
there’s
a
quality_attribute_3
way
to
use
the
component_6
component_7
overall
let’s
say
the
connector_data_1
only
cover
voice
connector_data_1
but
it
be
late
discover
that
the
voice
connector_data_1
alone
be
not
quality_attribute_4
without
the
distance
of
the
person
speak
from
the
microphone
now
there’s
a
need
for
connector_4
physical
connector_data_1
use
a
3d

test
ensure
you
run
each
real

connector_4
the

through
test
the

improve
the
number
