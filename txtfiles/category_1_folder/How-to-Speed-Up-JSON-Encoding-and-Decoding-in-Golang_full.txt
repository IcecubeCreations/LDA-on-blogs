but
this

this
lead

be
the

that
reduce

}comparing
librariesfirst
let’s
conduct
a
general
analysis
of
the
package
both
ffjson
and
easyjson
be
develop
at
the
same
pace
and
don’t
have
official
release
technology_6
iterator
go
be
be
develop
intensively
and
it
creator
quickly
resolve
issue
also
this
package
have
quickly
gain
strong
support
from
the
developer
despite
it
young
age
valyala
fastjson
have
gain
trust
in
the
developer
to
date
there’s
a
small
connector_data_8
of
issue
most
of
which
have
be
quickly
resolve
the
component_9
below
sum
up
the
general
characteristic
of
these
package
it
connector_data_9
the
current
version
of
the
package
or
their
last
common
hash
in
requirement_11
the
package
have
no
official
release
the
next
step
of
our
comparison
be
quality_attribute_1
test
for
this
we
use
go
use
the
above
we’ll
connector_5
how
fast
the
technology_7
package
and
four
alternative
solution
perform
go
technology_1
decoding
and
encoding
connector_10
also
technology_9
vs
go
which
be
quality_attribute_8
for
backend
web
development
for
more
precise
connector_data_10
we
perform
benchmark
test
with
three
type
of
connector_data_5
small
connector_data_4
up
to
kb
large
connector_data_4
from
to
connector_data_11
extra
large
connector_data_4
large
than
connector_data_11
here
be
the
connector_data_12
of
our
benchmark
test
to
analyze
the
connector_data_12
of
benchmark
test
we’ve
create
a
bar
requirement_12
that
show
the
quality_attribute_1
of
encoding
and
decoding
technology_1
connector_data_4
and
the
memory
allocation
for
the
encoding
technology_6
technology_6
iterator
go
ffjson
and
easyjson
package
here
be
the
memory
allocation
indicator
here’s
we
try
to
define
the
fast
technology_1
encoder
decoder
let’s
compare
the
package
that
use
pattern_2
for
encoding
decoding
encoding
technology_6
and
technology_6
iterator
go
the
technology_7
package
perform
encoding
fast
if
we
talk
about
how
to
quality_attribute_1
up
the
decoding
scanner
technology_6
iterator
go
perform
four
time
fast
than
the
technology_7
technology_5
next
be
easyjson
and
ffjson
which
use
generation
the
benchmark
test
show
that
easyjson
work
to
time
fast
than
fastjson
for
both
encoding
and
decoding
the
connector_data_12
also
show
time
fast
parallel
encoding
decoding
in
comparison
with
other
package
such
high
connector_data_12
be
reach
by
the
quality_attribute_5
use
of
a
buffer
pool
which
divide
large
chunk
of
connector_data_3
into
small
portion
for
their
further
use
with
pattern_3
pool
the
connector_data_12
of
fastjson
show
that
the
requirement_10
work
time
fast
with
small
connector_data_4
than
with
other
package
but
on
the
other
hand
it
quality_attribute_1
decrease
a
the
connector_data_5
size
grow
so
the
quality_attribute_1
of
encoding
large
connector_data_4
be
to
time
slow
than
others
this
be
explain
by
the
time
connector_11
component_4
of
text
requirement_10
bottom
line
our
benchmark
test
u
make
the
follow
conclusion
encoding
technology_6
be
a
quality_attribute_8
solution
for
work
with
small
connector_data_4
that
have
no
need
to
withstand
high
load
if
you
need
to
marshall
million
of
connector_data_4
with
a
similar
connector_data_6
you
can
use
package
with
generation
binary
serialization
require
two
to
four
time
more
ram
for
handle
connector_data_3
compare
with
other
the
requirement_10
use
in
fastjson
boast
exceptional
requirement_8
but
it
can’t
decode
technology_1
into
connector_data_5
it
create
a
fieldset
you
can
connector_9
connector_12
to
these
use
their
key
the
fastjson
package
can
be
use
when
you
need
to
connector_5
whether
a
exist
or
connector_9
the
requirement_9
while
bypass
the
decoding
component_4
a
you
can
see
the
choice
of
marshal
unmarshalling
heavily
quality_attribute_9
on
the
type
of
connector_data_3
you’re
go
to
work
with
if
you
wonder
what
the
best
solution
be
for
your
project
or
want
to
find
go

for
your
