introduction
requirement_1
be
a
blanket
term
for
the
non
traditional
strategy
and
technology_5
need
to
gather
organize
component_1
and
gather
insight
from
large
datasets
while
the
problem
of
work
with
connector_data_2
that
exceed
the
computing
power
or
storage
of
a
single
component_5
be
not

the
pervasiveness
quality_attribute_2
and
requirement_2
of
this
type
of
computing
have
greatly
expand
in
recent
year
in
a
previous
guide
we
discuss
some
of
the
general
concept
component_1
stage
and
terminology
use
in
requirement_1
component_2
in
this

we
will
take
a
look
at
one
of
the
most
essential
component_6
of
a
requirement_1
component_2
component_1
technology_3
component_1
technology_3
compute
over
the
connector_data_2
in
the
component_2
either
by
connector_2
from
non
volatile
storage
or
a
it
be
ingest
into
the
component_2
computing
over
connector_data_2
be
the
component_1
of
extract
connector_data_3
and
insight
from
large

of
individual
connector_data_2
point
we
will
cover

what
be
requirement_1
component_1
technology_3
component_1
technology_3
and
component_1
component_7
be
responsible
for
computing
over
connector_data_2
in
a
connector_data_2
component_2
while
there
be
no
authoritative
definition
set
apart
âenginesâ
from
âframeworksâ
it
be
sometimes
useful
to
define
the
former
a
the
actual
component_8
responsible
for
operate
on
connector_data_2
and
the
latter
a
a
set
of
component_6
design
to
do
the
same
for
instance
technology_6
technology_1
can
be
consider
a
component_1
technology_3
with
mapreduce
a
it
default
component_1
component_9
component_7
and
technology_3
can
often
be
swap
out
or
use
in
tandem
for
instance
technology_6
technology_2
another
technology_3
can
hook
into
technology_1
to
replace
mapreduce
this
quality_attribute_3
between
component_6
be
one
reason
that
requirement_1
component_10
have
great
quality_attribute_4
while
the
component_10
which
handle
this
stage
of
the
connector_data_2
life
cycle
can
be
complex
the
goal
on
a
broad
level
be
very
similar
operate
over
connector_data_2
in
order
to
increase
understand
surface
pattern_2
and
gain
insight
into
complex
connector_3
to
simplify
the
discussion
of
these
component_8
we
will
group
these
component_1
technology_3
by
the
state
of
the
connector_data_2
they
be
design
to
handle
some
component_10
handle
connector_data_2
in
pattern_1
while
others
component_1
connector_data_2
in
a
continuous
connector_1
a
it
flow
into
the
component_2
still
others
can
handle
connector_data_2
in
either
of
these
way
we
will
introduce
each
type
of
component_1
a
a
concept
before
dive
into
the
specific
and
consequence
of
various
implementation
pattern_1
component_1
component_10
pattern_1
component_1
have
a
long
history
within
the
requirement_1
world
pattern_1
component_1
involve
operate
over
a
large
coding_keyword_1

and
coding_keyword_2
the
connector_data_4
at
a
late
time
when
the

complete
the

in

pattern_1
datasets
represent
a
finite
collection
of

persistent
connector_data_2

almost
always
back
by
some
type
of

large
pattern_1
be
often
the
only
option
for
component_1
extremely
large
set
of
connector_data_2
pattern_1
component_1
be
well
suit
for
calculation
where
connector_4
to
a
complete
set
of
component_11
be
require
for
instance
when
calculate
total
and
average
datasets
must
be
treat
holistically
instead
of
a
a
collection
of
individual
component_12
these
require
that
state
be
maintain
for
the
duration
of
the
calculation
connector_data_5
that
require
very
large
volume
of
connector_data_2
be
often
best
handle
by
pattern_1

whether
the
datasets
be
component_1
directly
from
permanent

or
load
into

pattern_1
component_10
be
build
with
large

and
have
the

to

it

other

that

not
a

the
low

of

inexpensive
and
quality_attribute_9
for
many
use
requirement_7
quality_attribute_10
and
requirement_6
with
other
technology_3

instead
of

âunboundedâ
this
have
a
few
important
implication
the
total
dataset
be
only
define
a
the
amount
of
connector_data_2
that
have
enter
the
component_2
so
far
the
work
dataset
be
perhaps
more
relevant
and
be
limit
to
a

item
at
a

connector_1

independent
of

this
kind
of
component_1
fit
well
with
connector_8
because
state
between
connector_data_9
be
usually
some
combination
of
difficult

and
sometimes
undesirable
so
while
some

possible
these
technology_3
be
much
quality_attribute_11

more

this
type
of

lend
itself
to

type
of

error
requirement_10
and
other
time
base
metric
be
a
natural
fit
because
technology_12
to
connector_10
in
these
area
can
be
critical
to
requirement_11

connector_1
component_1
be
a
quality_attribute_13
fit
for

technology_6
technology_7
be
a
connector_1

be
perhaps
the
best
option
for

that
require

component_1
it
can
handle

the
idea
behind

this

each

a

samza

this

samzaâs
reliance
on
a
technology_15

pattern_9
component_2
at
first
glance
might
seem
restrictive
however
it
afford
the
component_2
some
unique

and
feature
not
common
in
other
connector_1
component_1
component_2
for
example
technology_15
already
offer
replicate
storage
of
connector_data_2
that
can
be
connector_20
with
low

it
also
provide

component_16
to
each

component_24
all

include
intermediate
connector_data_4
be
also
connector_5
to

and
can
be
independently
connector_19
by
downstream
stage
in
many
way
this
tight
reliance
on
technology_15
mirror
the
way
that
the
mapreduce
component_9
frequently
reference
technology_9
while
reference
technology_9
between
each
calculation
lead
to
some
serious
requirement_13
issue
when
pattern_1
component_1
it
solve
a
number
of
problem
when
connector_1
component_1
samzaâs
strong
relationship
to
technology_15
allow
the
component_1
step
themselves
to
be
very
loosely
tie
together
an
arbitrary
number
of
pattern_10
can
be

to
the
output
of
any
step
without
prior
coordination
this
can
be
very
useful
for
organization
where
multiple

might
need
to
connector_4
similar
connector_data_2
team
can
all
subscribe
to
the

enter
the

this
can
be
do
without

component_27

also
eliminate
the

great
than

can
component_1
in

lead
to

stall
and
potentially
connector_data_2
loss
technology_15
be
design
to
hold
connector_data_2
for
very
long
period
of
time
which
mean
that
component_6
can
component_1
at
their
convenience
and
can
be
restart
without

samza
be
able
to
component_15
state
use

this
allow

but
it
do
not

recovery
of

in
the

since

samza
offer
high

technology_2

than
mapreduce
which
can
have
significant
implication
for

adapt
the

methodology
for

component_1
involve

it
enter
the

the

increasing
overall
quality_attribute_19
but
wait
to
flush
the

also
lead
to
a
significant
increase
in

this
mean
that
technology_2
connector_9
might
not
be
appropriate
for
component_1
where
low
quality_attribute_14
be
imperative
since
ram

technology_2
can
cost
more

however
the

completely
offset

where
you
pay

one
other
consequence
of

technology_3
technology_1

with

package
one
of
the
large
drawback
of
flink
at
the
moment
be
that
it
be
still
a
very
young
project
large
quality_attribute_2
deployment
in

be
still
not
a
common
a
other
component_1
technology_3
and
there
hasnât
be
much
research
into
flinkâs
quality_attribute_22
limitation
with
the
rapid
development
cycle
and
feature
the
quality_attribute_10
package
there
begin
to
be

a
organization

the
chance

summary
flink
offer
both
low
quality_attribute_14
connector_1
component_1
with
support
for
traditional
pattern_1
connector_data_8
flink
be
probably
best
suit
for
organization
that
have
heavy
connector_1
component_1
requirement
and
some
pattern_1
orient
connector_data_8
it
quality_attribute_10
with
requirement_4
technology_7
and
technology_1
component_32
and
it
ability
to
run
on
a
technology_11
manage
cluster
can
make
it
easy
to
evaluate
it
rapid
development
make
it
worth
keep
an

on

there
be
plenty
of
option
for

not
