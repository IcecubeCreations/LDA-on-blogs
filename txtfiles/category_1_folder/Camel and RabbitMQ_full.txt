technology_1
and
technology_2
a
common
component_1
for
connector_1
eip
in
technology_3
be
to
use
technology_4
technology_1
with
some
sort
of
mq
or
technology_5
back
one
of
the
more
interest
mq
technology_6
in
use
today
be
the
technology_7
base
technology_2
technology_1
be
a
very
widely
use
requirement_1
component_2
it’s
very
quality_attribute_1
and
take
care
of
wire
up
component_3
mediate
connector_data_1
transform
connector_data_2
among
many
other
useful
thing
it
also
come
with
ton
of
component_4
out
of
the
component_5
notice
one
of
the
component_4
it
support
be
technology_8
however
that
would
make
life
far
too
easy
for
technology_2
component_6
what
the
technology_1
documentation
doesn’t
mention
be
that
technology_1
be
use
apache’s
technology_9
a
the
technology_10
implementation
for
whatever
reason
technology_9
do
not
play
nicely
with
technology_2
thus
the
need
for
some
help
from
the
always
handy
technology_11
technology_6
technology_11
offer
an
technology_10
solution
with
the
technology_11
technology_10

since
technology_11
and
technology_2
be
owned
by
the
same
requirement_2
it’s
pretty
clear
that
they’re
design
to
work
together
however
in
order
to
connector_2
technology_1
talk
to
technology_11
technology_8
we
need
to
roll
our
own
component_7
–
or
quality_attribute_2
yet
–
troll
technology_12
technology_13
be
awesome
the
ability
to
connector_3
someone’s

see
it
full
history
easily
fork
and
modify
it
–
make
life
much
easy
fortunately
i
find
a
that
connector_4
a
technology_1
component_7
that
can
talk
to
a
technology_2
pattern_1
via
rabbitmq’s
technology_3
requirement_3
component_8
and
the
technology_11
technology_10
implementation
the
be
create
by
bluelock
you
can
find
it
here
additionally
awesome
be
that
bluelock
submit
the
to
technology_14
central
so
it’s
super
easy
to
connector_2
at
first
let’s
some
connector_5
to
our
pom
technology_15

the
follow
to

next
we’ll
need
to
modify

technology_15
or
whatever
you’ve
name
it
and
the
follow

the

component_12
set
up
the
rabbit
converter
the

and
the
connector_6
factory
for
technology_11
technology_8
the
next
two
component_10
definition
set
the
configuration
default
setting
for
the
technology_2
pattern_1
and
the
xstream
converter
provide
by
bluelock’s
technology_6
i
assume
the
converter
be
necessary
because
unlike
technology_5
i
e
when
use
camel+activemq
you
can’t
serialize
technology_3
connector_data_3
use
java’s
build
in
serialization
–
you
have
to
explicitly
specify
the
of
serialize
the
connector_data_2
to
the
pattern_1
now
for
the
fun
part
set
up
the
technology_1
connector_7
be
a
developer
my
killer
feature
in
technology_1
be
be
able
to
define
my
connector_7
via
dsl
in
my
ide
use
connector_data_4
to
set
these
up
i
e
use
technology_21
esb
technology_22
etc
be
a
real
pain
furthermore
you
can
use
technology_23
technology_24
and
of
technology_3
base
dsl
in
this
example
i’m
use
the
technology_24
dsl
for
define
the
connector_7
i’ll
demonstrate
two
rather
quality_attribute_3
connector_7
produce
to
and
connector_8
from
the
pattern_1

}
pretty
quality_attribute_3
connector_3
connector_data_8
off
the
component_14
and
requirement_4
them
so
that’s
basically
it
i
didn’t
go
over
instal
technology_2
or
set
up
technology_14
for
compile
technology_24
and
technology_3
in
the
same
build
however
now
you
should
be
able
to
connector_2
go
with
technology_2
and
technology_1
fairly
quickly
bluelock
have
do
a
great
connector_1
this

however
i’m
not
sure
if
i’d
be
fully
comfortable
throw
this
into
a
production
component_16
because
it
simply
isn’t
prove
yet
on
the
other
hand
it’s
open_source
so
if
you’re
will
to
fork
it
and
support
it
yourself
then
you’re
golden
personally
if
i
be
use
technology_3
and
technology_1
for
primary
development
i
would
stick
with
technology_26
it’s
design
to
work
with
technology_1
i
e
you
don’t
need
any
of
the
above
setup
and
be
certainly
prove
on
countless
production
deployment
hello
i
m
arthur
i
m
a
engineer
currently
my
focus
be
on
test
drive
design
and
development
for
quality_attribute_4
web
component_17
and
web
component_18
this
be
largely
dedicate
but
not
limit
to
topic
in
this
area
feel
free
to
me
use
any
of
the
connector_9
