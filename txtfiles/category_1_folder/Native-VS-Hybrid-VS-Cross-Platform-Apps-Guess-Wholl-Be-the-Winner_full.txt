who’ll
be
the
winner
requirement_1
vs
hybrid
vs
cross
component_1
component_2
guess
who’ll
be
the
winner
requirement_2
component_3
be
an
integral
part
of
our
life
there
be
numerous
thing
around
u
but
requirement_2
be
something
we
always
keep
close
to
ourselves
if
your
smartphone
be
lose
you
will
be
paranoid
in
that
desperate
time
your
topmost
priority
will
be
to
purchase
a
requirement_2
phone
to
connector_1
along
in
life
do
you
connector_1
that
this
be
the
relevance
of
requirement_2
phone
in
your
life
requirement_2
be
with
u
every
second
a
a
requirement_3
owner
it
will
be
one
of
the
most
profound
asset
for
reach
your
prospect
yes
give
it
a
think
and
you
will
understand
what
point
i
be
make
from
the
requirement_3
perspective
certain
requirement_2
component_4
have
become
imperative
this
be
the
principal
reason
for
a
requirement_3
to
develop
requirement_2
component_5
it
will
bring
laurel
to
your
requirement_3
and
act
a
a
quick
component_1
to
connector_2
with
your
component_6
easily
and
serve
them
well
what’s
next
so
you
have
decide
to
develop
a
requirement_2
component_7
for
your
requirement_3
the
next
thing
you
will
do
here
be
to
select
a
component_1
where
you
want
to
develop
the
component_7
choose
the
right
reap
grind
be
paramount
i
believe
this
decision
of
choose
a
component_1
for
requirement_2
development
entirely
quality_attribute_1
on
the
nature
of
your
requirement_3
the
secret
war
of
requirement_2
component_4
from
the
dawn
of
requirement_2
component_2
there
have
be
a
war
between
the
type
of
wag
approach
no
one
can
say
when
it
start
and
when
it
be
go
to
end
but
it
be
there
and
it
be
happen
you
must
have
hear
about
requirement_1
component_2
and
hybrid
component_2
which
one
will
be
the
salvation
for
your
requirement_3
and
this
entirely
quality_attribute_1
on
the
nature
of
your
requirement_3
it
be
the
coding_keyword_1
reason
i
decide
to
connector_3
a
coding_keyword_2
about
it
to
clear
out
some
conflict
fact
about
requirement_1
component_7
development
and
hybrid
component_7
development
in
addition
to
that
i
be
also

one
more
perspective
which
be
cross
component_1
component_7
development
with
the
help
of
this
coding_keyword_2
you
can
easily
comprehend
which
approach
be
quality_attribute_2
for
your
requirement_3
and
which
be
not
the
component_7
development
approach
start
with
the
online
requirement_3
idea
and
harvest
the
component_4
with
which
they
can
build
outstanding
component_2
so
it
be
a
connector_data_1
of
the
requirement_3
nature
you
want
to
follow
either
requirement_1
hybrid
or
cross
component_1
when
this
coding_keyword_2
will
be
over
you
will
thank
me
so
without
further
technology_1
let’s
connector_1
you
start
requirement_1
vs
hybrid
vs
cross
component_1
a
i
mention
above
the
secret
war
between
the
different
requirement_2
component_2
be
wag
and
you
need
to
connector_1
it
right
if
you
want
to
leverage
the
complete
benefit
of
the
requirement_2
component_5
in
this
section
of
the
coding_keyword_2
i
have
quality_attribute_3
point
regard
the
different
requirement_2
component_7
development
approach
cover
all
their
advantage
and
disadvantage
what
be
a
requirement_1
requirement_2
component_7
let’s
first
understand
what
a
requirement_1
requirement_2
component_7
be
requirement_1
requirement_2
component_2
be
the
most
common
type
of
component_2
in
layman’s
technology_2
these
component_2
be
design
for
a
specific
component_1
and
develop
in
the
technology_2
connector_4
by
these
component_1
for
instance
if
you
be
design
a
requirement_2
component_7
for
the
io
component_1
then
you
will
use
technology_3
and
technology_4
on
the
other
hand
if
it
be
the
technology_5
component_7
development
then
the
connector_4
technology_2
will
be
technology_6
to
make
thing
clear
the
two
big
conglomerate
apple
and

make
their
stance
quite
clear
in
this
prefer
technology_5
while
apple
adhere
to
it
io
component_7
development
with
that
they
launch
their
own
element
and
development
technology_7
an
ample
number
of
requirement_4
invest
in
requirement_1
requirement_2
component_2
today
why
have
a
look
at
the
benefit
give
below
and
you
will
understand
why
requirement_1
component_8
be
prefer
the
benefit
of
requirement_1
component_2
you
must
since
requirement_1
component_7
development
be
for
the
specific
component_1
they
be
deem
to
be
responsive
and
lightning
fast
they
be
mean
to
operate
at
a
high
requirement_5
rate
when
we
talk
about
component_6
input
and
output
requirement_1
component_2
be
the
best
they
be
interactive
smooth
and
intuitive
a
a
requirement_1
component_5
be
a
design
with
respect
to
a
particular
component_1
the
developer
have
the
full
liberty
to
optimize
the
component_7
a
per
the
requirement_1
component_1
by
any
mean
quality_attribute_4
you
can
also
an
offline
feature
that
you
cannot
find
in
a
hybrid
component_5
the
requirement_1
sdks
allow
you
to
connector_5
the
device’s
requirement_1
feature
such
a
gps
they
be
not
dependent
on
open
component_9
technology_8
such
a
technology_9
and
technology_10
a
requirement_1
ui
allow
the
component_10
to
the
component_7
efficiently
and
quickly
in
addition
to
that
the
requirement_6
be
quality_attribute_2
and
engage
the
quality_attribute_5
of
the
requirement_1
component_7
be
also
very
quality_attribute_6
these
point
really
make
it
easy
to
choose
requirement_1
component_8
over
hybrid
however
i
reckon
you
to
wait
until
the
end
drawback
of
requirement_1
component_2
in
this
section
i
want
you
to
understand
certain
disadvantage
of
requirement_1
component_2
for
a
requirement_3
it
be
imperative
to
identify
the
disadvantage
of
requirement_1
component_2
there
be
possibility
that
these
disadvantage
or
not
affect
your
requirement_3
but

them
will
certainly
help
you
in
the
great
cause
develop
a
requirement_1
component_5
be
a
tedious
connector_data_2
it
require
separate
development
component_11
for
every
component_1
a
separate
development
component_12
increase
the
development
time
significantly
a
the
above
point
state
separate
development
component_11
require
separate
connector_data_3
a
well
it
will
increase
the
development
time
and
cost
significantly
with
different
base
it
be
always
difficult
to
release
the
same
feature
on
all
component_4
at
the
same
time
with
variant
component_1
the
cost
of
development
and
quality_attribute_7
of
the
requirement_2
component_5
be
expensive
imagine
how
the
requirement_2
component_7
development
go
final
verdict
on
requirement_1
requirement_2
component_5
if
you
be
a
requirement_3
with
limit
budget
you
might
want
to
go
for
an
alternative
to
requirement_1
component_2
a
it
be
expensive
and
the
quality_attribute_7
cost
be
also
very
high
if
you
be
a
requirement_3
that
must
serve
it
audience
well
then
you
should
look
at
the
cost
and
go
for
it
requirement_1
component_2
be
component_6
friendly
and
lightfast
which
ensure
quality_attribute_2
and
quality
requirement_7
engagement
what
be
a
hybrid
requirement_2
component_7
a
hybrid
requirement_2
component_7
be
a
requirement_1
requirement_2
component_7
that
a
component_6
can
download
from
the
component_1
s
component_7
component_13
the
real
difference
lie
in
the
development
component_12
which
be
why
it
become
crucial
to
understand
the
basic
difference
between
a
requirement_1
and
hybrid
requirement_2
component_7
let’s
have
a
look
at
the
benefit
of
a
hybrid
requirement_2
component_7
to
connector_1
a
comprehensive
understand
to
utilize
them
in
requirement_3
the
benefit
of
a
hybrid
requirement_2
component_7
the
hybrid
requirement_2
component_2
be
build
with
the
help
of
technology_11
such
a
technology_12
cs
and
technology_13
this
make
them
functional
through
all
the
requirement_2
component_1
connector_6
single
for
a
requirement_2
component_7
mean
that
you
only
need
to
connector_3
the
once
it
will
connector_7
a
lot
of
development
time
and
money
you
can
run
a
hybrid
requirement_2
component_7
a
a
progressive
web
component_7
this
provide
component_6
easiness
hardware
base
requirement_5
acceleration
in
hybrid
component_7
development
be
the
same
a
of
requirement_1
component_7
development
hybrid
component_2
also
have
a
quality_attribute_2
requirement_6
and
requirement_5
across
component_1
isn’t
sweet
but
wait
before
you
make
your
final
decision
you
might
want
to
have
a
look
at
some
of
the
disadvantage
of
the
hybrid
requirement_2
component_7
drawback
of
hybrid
component_2
hybrid
component_2
perform
similarly
for
most
of
the
component_2
except
for
some
component_8
such
a
3d
hd
game
and
other
high
graphic
orient
component_2
a
hybrid
component_7
must
have
a
requirement_1
plugin
to
connector_5
the
basic
component_1
such
a
the
touch
coding_keyword_3
and
camera
if
there
be
no
requirement_1
plugin
for
that
then
it
be
a
tedious
connector_data_2
to
develop
for
a
requirement_2
developer
all
the
hybrid
requirement_2
component_2
be
dependent
on
open
component_9
technology_14
and
technology_8
such
a
technology_9
and
technology_10
so
what
do
you
understand
from
this
differentiation
final
verdict
on
hybrid
requirement_2
component_5
if
your
requirement_3
have
a
low
budget
you
can
leverage
hybrid
component_7
development
which
will
render
cost
connector_8
benefit
in
requirement_8
of
high
budget
plan
the
requirement_3
can
still
opt
for
it
and
for
touch
coding_keyword_3
and
others
you
can
develop
cod
to
enable
it
in
the
requirement_2
component_7
component_7
type
requirement_1
hybrid
cross
component_1
codebase
it
have
different
codebases
i
e
one
per
component_1
it
consist
of
a
single
codebase
with
a
potential
component_1
quality_attribute_1
on
the
specific
capability
it
too
have
a
single
codebase
carry
a
potential
component_1
with
major
capability
technology_8
it
doesn’t
have
any
connector_9
on
open
component_9
technology_8
and
component_1
it
be
highly
dependent
on
certain
technology_8
and
technology_14
it
too
have
a
high
connector_9
on
the
different
technology_8
and
technology_14
debug
developer
can
use
the

technology_7
developer
can
use

the

one
can
expect

con

there

a
cross

solution
you
might
be
interest
in
a
cross
browser
requirement_2
component_7
be
a
type
of
hybrid
component_5
that
will
work
in
all
type
of
component_1
you
might
be
wonder
why
it
be
different
from
a
hybrid
requirement_2
component_7
well
this
approach
be
deem
to
be
a
developer
friendly
approach
the
amount
of
require
for
requirement_2
component_7
development
in
this
approach
be
the
key
difference
a
developer
require
a
significantly
low
volume
of
to
develop
a
cross
browser
requirement_2
component_7
coding_keyword_4
me
connector_1
your
connector_12
solve
here
be
cross
component_1
component_7
development
quality_attribute_2
than
requirement_1
component_7
development
majorly
it
quality_attribute_1
on
the
type
of
technology_19
you’re
build
and
the
keynote
you
have
about
your
target
audience
if
we
understand
it
through
the
example
we
can
analyze
it
for
instance
when
you
conduct
the
requirement_10
research
you
notice
that
your
potent
requirement_7
have
io
will
you
choose
technology_5
at
that
time
no
i
guess
there
be
certainly
a
choice
of
the
component_1
but
it
quality_attribute_1
on
your
audience’s
taste
rest
you
can
decide
on
the
basis
of
the
afore
mention
pro
and
con
you
will
find
many
myth
that
talk
about
cross
component_1
component_7
development
but
depict
poor
quality
with
the
passage
of
time
cross
component_1
development
be
no
more
lag
behind
and
you
will
find
many
proof
relevant
to
it
what
be
the
exact
difference
between
requirement_1
component_1
and
cross
component_1
you

requirement_1
component_2
be
basically
develop
for
a
specific
component_1
these
be
build
up
in
a
technology_2
that
be
quality_attribute_12
with
the
component_1
coding_keyword_4
u
understand
this
with
an
instance
if
you
be
an
apple
developer
you
would
prefer
objective
technology_20
and
if
you
be
a
developer
at

you
might
favor
technology_6
or
technology_5
developer
have
the
full
potential
to
use
such
innovative
feature
at
their
choice
of
component_1
to
bring
something
out
of
the
component_15
it
be
also
true
that
the
requirement_1
component_7
develop
for
technology_5
will
not
work
on
io
and
vice
versa
if
we
talk
about
the
cross
component_1
component_7
these
be
generally
quality_attribute_12
with
multiple
component_1
most
of
the
cross
component_1
component_2
be
limit
to
the
two
operate
component_16
i
e
technology_5
and
io
you’ll
find
the
difference
base
on
the
aspect
such
a
multiple
component_4
deployment
cost
development
time
component_7
component_6
design
challenge
and
programming
expertise
which
be
quality_attribute_2
hybrid
or
requirement_1
component_7
look
if
you
choose
requirement_1
component_2
these
be
the
most
quality_attribute_13
and
fast
when
we
talk
about
the
requirement_6
these
be
build
with
the
help
of
the
operate
system’s
technology_21
which
can
connector_2
with
certain
component_17
feature
the
disadvantage
come
out
when
the
discussion
include
development
and
quality_attribute_7
cost
hybrid
component_2
be
typically
easy
and
fast
to
develop
a
compare
to
requirement_1
component_2
they
also
need
le
quality_attribute_7
and
the
quality_attribute_14
will
also
be
define
in
a
limit
manner
requirement_1
component_7
development
can
bring
you
exclusive
benefit
whilst
hybrid
component_7
development
have
it
own
define
set
maybe
this
can
be
your
way
out
give

your

on
this

i
