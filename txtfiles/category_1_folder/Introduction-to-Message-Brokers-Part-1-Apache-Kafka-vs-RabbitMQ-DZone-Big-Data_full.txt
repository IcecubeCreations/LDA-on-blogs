we

why
do

appear
can
you
imagine
the

in

nowadays
about

billion
smart
component_5
be
connector_4
to

consider
that
about

billion
people
live
on
the
planet
we
have
almost
one
and
a
half
component_3
per
person
by

this
number
will
significantly
increase
to

billion
or
even
more
with
technological
development
the
build
of

and
other

digitization
developer
face
the
problem
of
successful
connector_data_2
exchange
imagine
you
have
your
own
component_6
for
example
it
s
an
online
component_7
so
you
permanently
work
in
your
technological
scope
and
one
day
you
need
to
make
the
component_6
connector_6
with
other
component_8
previously
you
would
use
quality_attribute_2
end
point
for
component_2
to
component_2
connector_5
but
nowadays
we
have
special
connector_data_1
pattern_1
they
make
the
component_9
of
connector_data_2
exchange
quality_attribute_2
and
quality_attribute_3
these
technology_5
use
different
technology_6
that
determine
the
connector_data_1
technology_7
the

show
how
the

should
be

in

wikipedia
component_10
this
be
essential
part
of
component_11
requirement_10
they
ensure
the
connector_9
of
connector_data_4
from
point
a
to
point
b
pattern_4
component_9
when
be
a
connector_data_1
pattern_1
need
if
you
want
to
control
connector_data_2
feed
for
example
the
number
of
registration
in
any
component_4
when
the
connector_data_5
be
to
connector_10
connector_data_2
to
several
component_12
and
avoid
direct
use
of
their
technology_8
when
you
need
to
complete
component_13
in
a
define
order
a
pattern_6
component_4
so
we
can
say
that
connector_data_1
pattern_1
can
do
four
important
thing
divide
the
pattern_7
and
component_14
component_7
the
connector_data_1
connector_11
connector_data_1
connector_12
and
organize

there
be

a
for

pattern_1
they
didn
t
satisfy
linkedin
s
need
these

be

so
the
engineering
team
develop
a
quality_attribute_9
and
fault
tolerant
pattern_4
component_4
without

of

the

have
quickly
transform

the
picture
below
show
the

capability
of
this

manager
a
you
can
see
technology_1

be
able
to
publish

key

and
concept
first
of
all
you
should
about
the
abstraction
of
a
quality_attribute_7
connector_20
requirement_2
this
confuse
term
be
crucial
for
understand
connector_data_1
pattern_1
technology_1

work
principle
there
be
two
pattern_11
of
connector_data_1
pattern_12
pattern_13
both
of
them
have
some
pro
and
con
the
advantage
of
the
first
pattern_11
be
the
opportunity
to
easily
quality_attribute_12
the
component_9
on
the
other
hand
component_22
aren
t
multi
pattern_14
the
second
component_23
provide
the
possibility
to
pattern_15
connector_data_2
to
multiple
component_14
group
at
the
same
time
quality_attribute_13
be
more
difficult
in
this
requirement_9
technology_1
technology_2
combine
these
two
way
of
connector_data_2
component_9
connector_21
the
benefit
of
both
of
them
it
should
be
mention
that
this
component_16
manager
provide
quality_attribute_5
order
guarantee
than
a
traditional
connector_data_1
pattern_1
technology_2
peculiarity
combine
the
of
connector_data_1
storage
and
component_9
technology_2
isn
t
a
common
connector_data_1
pattern_1
it
s
a
powerful
connector_14
component_15
capable
of
handle
trillion
of
connector_data_6
a
day
technology_2
be
useful
both
for
connector_22
and
component_9
historical
connector_data_2
from
the
past
and
for
real
time
work
you
can
use
it
for
create
connector_14
component_6
a
well
a
for
connector_14
connector_data_2
pipeline
if
you
want
to
follow
the
step
of
technology_2
component_24
you
should
be
mindful
of
some
nuance
the
connector_data_6

t
have
separate

they
be
connector_23
by
their
offset
in
the
requirement_2
the
component_4
doesn
t
connector_12
the
component_25
of
each
topic
or
connector_data_1
technology_2
doesn
t
maintain
any
index
and
doesn
t
allow
random
connector_24
it
connector_25
the
connector_data_6
in
order
start
with
the
offset
the
component_4
doesn
t
have
delete
and
doesn
t
buffer
the
connector_data_6
in
userspace
but
there
be
various
quality_attribute_14
storage
strategy
conclusion
be
a
perfect
open
component_17
solution
for
real
time
statistic
and
requirement_1
project
this
connector_data_1
pattern_1
have
some
weakness
the
thing
be
it
require
you
to
work
a
lot
you
will
feel
a
lack
of

and
other
thing
that
can
be
simply
quality_attribute_15
in

i
recommend
you
to
use
this

it
be
successfully

this

because
of

you
should

the
component_29
us
the
pattern_1
to
connector_12
the
state

verify
whether
the

technology_3
peculiarity
the
advantage
of
this
connector_data_1
pattern_1
be
the
perfect
set
of

combine
with

quality_attribute_6
many
web

enjoy

a
well
a
the
possibility

fanout
exchange
component_23
all
component_25
connector_4
to
component_22
connector_2
the
connector_data_1
here
you
can
see
the
gap
between
technology_2
and
technology_3
if
a
component_14
isn

connector_4
to
a
fanout
exchange
in
technology_3
the
connector_data_1
will
be
lose
at
the

time
technology_2
allow
u
to
avoid
this
because
any

conclusion
a
for
me
i
technology_3
due
to
the

it
