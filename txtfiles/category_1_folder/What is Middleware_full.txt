technology_1
be
that
be
use
to
bridge
the
gap
between
component_6
and
other
technology_2
or
component_3
technology_1
sit
between
an
operate
component_7
and
the
component_6
that
run
on
it
it
be
effectively
that
provide
a
of
connector_3
and
connector_data_1
requirement_3
between
component_6
that
would
otherwise
not
have
any
way
to
exchange
connector_data_1
such
a
with
technology_2
and
component_3
technology_1
appear
in
many
location
however
organization
and
developer
make
specific
use
of
technology_1
to
more
efficiently
build
component_1
organization
that
use
multi
requirement_5
and
containerize
environment
will
often
also
use
technology_1
a
a

quality_attribute_1
way
to

why
be
it
connector_4
technology_1
the
name
technology_1
stem
from
the
fact
that
it
be

that

side
connector_data_2
on

and
the

resource
be
connector_data_3
a
component_8
can
make
a
connector_data_3
with
requirement_1
base
connector_5
that
component_8
be
typically
an
component_1
that
reside
on
the

this

it
could

the
role
of

be
to

might
create

pool
to
provide

it
can
also
create

base
on
the

for
example
a

component_17
might
recognize
that
a

browser
make
a
give
connector_data_3
have
the

set
to
english
and
a
a

the
connector_12
it
make
to
the
component_13
might
be
tweak
to
nothing
but
english
base
connector_data_6
or
perhaps
a
component_15
could
identify
the
geographical
location
of
the
component_8
make
the
connector_data_3
base
on
it
ip
connector_13
and
connector_data_1
to
the

that
prioritize
connector_data_7
that
be
locate

by
the
ability
to
take

perform
component_19
and
then
customize
the

third
technology_1
play
an

requirement_3
technology_1
typically

at
the

finally
technology_1
play
an
important
role
in
quality_attribute_7
connector_1
to

end
resource
technology_1
have
the
ability
to
challenge
component_8
it
require
both
a
quality_attribute_7
connector_10
use
a

use
either
a

this
quality_attribute_8
connector_data_8
be
then
use

be
affirm
the

if

set
stand
