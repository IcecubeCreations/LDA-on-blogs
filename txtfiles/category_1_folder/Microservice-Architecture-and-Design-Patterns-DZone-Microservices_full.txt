pattern_1
architecture
have
become
the
de
facto
choice
for
modern
component_2
development
though
it
solve
certain
problem
it
be
not
a
silver
bullet
it
have
several
drawback
and
when
use
this
architecture
there
be
numerous
issue
that
must
be
connector_5
this
bring
about
the
need
to
common
pattern_2
in
these
problem
and
solve
them
with
quality_attribute_2
solution
thus
design
pattern_2
for
pattern_3
need
to
be
discuss
before
we
dive
into
the
design
pattern_2
we
need
to
understand
on
what
principle

about
make
component_3
loosely

apply
the
single

principle
however
break
an
component_2
into
small
piece
have
to
be
do
logically
how
do
we
decompose
an
component_2
into
small
component_4
solution
one
strategy
be
to
decompose
by
requirement_7
capability
a
requirement_7
capability
be
something
that
a
requirement_7
do
in
order
to
generate
requirement_8
the
set
of
capability
for
a
give
requirement_7
quality_attribute_5
on
the
type
of
requirement_7
for
example
the
capability
of
an
insurance
requirement_9
typically
include
sale
requirement_10
underwrite
claim
component_5
bill
compliance
etc
each
requirement_7
capability
can
be
think
of
a
a
component_4
except
it’s
requirement_7
orient
rather
than
technical
b
decompose

decompose
an
component_2
use
requirement_7

might
be
a
quality_attribute_6
start
but
you
will
come
across
so
connector_data_1
god

which
will
not
be
easy
to
decompose
these
will
be
common
among
multiple
component_4
for
example
the
order
will
be

each

technology_3
strangler
pattern_2
problem
so
far
the
design
pattern_2
we
talk
about
be
decompose
component_8
for
greenfield
but
80%
of
the
work
we
do
be
with
brownfield
component_2
which
be
big
monolithic
component_2
apply
all
the
above
design
pattern_2
to
them
will
be
difficult
because
break
them
into
small
piece
at
the
same
time
it
s
be
use
live
be
a
big
connector_data_2
solution
the
strangler
pattern_2
come
to
the
rescue
the
strangler
pattern_2
be
base
on
an
analogy
to
a
vine
that
strangle
a
tree
that
it’s
wrap
around
this
solution
work
well
with
web
component_2
where
a
connector_data_1
go
back
and
forth
and
for
each
uri
connector_data_1
a
component_4
can
be
break
into
different
domain
and
component_9
a
separate
component_4
the
idea
be
to
do
it
one
domain
at
a
time
this
create
two
separate
component_8
that
live
side
by
side
in
the
same
uri
space
eventually
the
newly
refactored
component_2
“strangles”
or
replace
the
original

finally
you
can
shut
off

a

pattern_2
problem
when
an
component_2
be
break
down
to
small
pattern_3
there
be
a
few
concern
that
need
to
be
connector_5
how
to
connector_data_1
multiple
pattern_3
abstract
component_11
connector_data_4
on
different
pattern_5

desktop
requirement_13
and
tablet
component_12
need
different
connector_data_5
to
respond
for
the
same
backend
component_4
a
the
ui
might
be
different
different
component_13
might
need
a
different
technology_4
of
the
connector_7
from
quality_attribute_2
pattern_3
who
will
do
the
connector_data_5
transformation
or
manipulation
how
to
handle
different
type
of
technology_5
some
of
which
might
not
be
support
by
component_11
pattern_1
solution
an
component_10
gateway
help
to
connector_5
many
concern
raise
by
pattern_1
implementation
not
limit
to
the
one
above
an
component_10
gateway
be
the
single
point
of
entry
for
any
pattern_1
connector_data_1
it
can
work
a
a
pattern_6
component_4
to
connector_8
a
connector_data_6
to
the
concern
pattern_1
abstract
the
component_11
detail
it
can
fan
out
a
connector_data_6
to
multiple
component_3
and
aggregate
the
connector_data_7
to
connector_9
back
to
the
component_14
one
size
fit
all
component_15
cannot
solve
all
the
component_14
s
requirement
this
solution
can
create
a
fine
grain
component_10
for
each
specific
type
of
component_16
it
can
also
convert
the
technology_5
connector_data_6
e
g
technology_6
to
another
technology_5
e
g
technology_7
and
vice
versa
so
that
the
component_11
and
component_14
can
handle
it
it
can
also
offload
the
pattern_7
pattern_8
responsibility
of
the
pattern_1
b
aggregator
pattern_2
problem
we
have
talk
about
resolve
the
aggregate
connector_data_5
problem
in
the
component_10
gateway
pattern_2
however
we
will
talk
about
it
here
holistically
when
break
the
requirement_7
requirement_14
into
several
small
logical
piece
of

it
become
necessary
to
think
about
how
to
collaborate
the
connector_data_5

by
each
component_4
this
responsibility
cannot
be
leave
with
the
component_14
a
then
it
might
need
to
understand
the
internal
implementation
of
the
component_11
component_2
solution
the
aggregator
pattern_2
help
to
connector_5
this
it
talk
about
how
we
can
aggregate
the
connector_data_5
from
different
component_3
and
then
connector_9
the
final
connector_7
to
the
component_14
this
can
be
do
in
two
way

a
composite
pattern_1
will
make
connector_data_8
to
all
the
require
pattern_3
consolidate
the
connector_data_5
and
transform
the
connector_data_5
before
connector_10
back

an
component_10
gateway
can
also
component_17
the
connector_data_6
to
multiple
pattern_3
and
aggregate
the
connector_data_5
before
connector_10
it
to
the
component_14
it
be
recommend
if
any
requirement_7
component_18
be
to
be
apply
then
choose
a
composite

otherwise

the

responsible
for
requirement_15
have
to
connector_11
connector_data_5
from
several

in
the

world
there
use
to
be
only
one
connector_data_1
from

component_4
to

all
connector_data_5

however
now
it
win
t
be

we
need
to
understand
how
to
do
it

the

have
to
be
design
a
a

pattern_2
a
component_1
per
component_4
problem
there
be
a
problem
of
how
to
define
component_1
architecture
for
pattern_3
follow
be
the
concern
to
be
connector_5

component_3
must
be
loosely

they
can
be
develop
quality_attribute_7
and
quality_attribute_8
independently

some
requirement_7
transaction
need
to
query
connector_data_5
that
be
owned
by
multiple
component_4

component_1
must
sometimes
be
replicate
and
sharded
in
order
to
quality_attribute_8

different
component_3
have
different
connector_data_5
storage
requirement
solution
to
solve
the
above
concern
one
component_1
per
pattern_1
must
be
design
it
must
be
private
to
that
component_4
only
it
should
be
connector_13
by
the
pattern_1
component_10
only
it
cannot
be
connector_13
by
other
component_3
directly
for
example
for
relational
component_1
we
can
use
private
component_22
per
component_4
schema
per
component_4
or
component_1
component_23
per
component_4
each
pattern_1
should
have
a
separate
component_1
so
that
separate
connector_14
can
be
give
to
put
up
a
barrier
and
prevent
it
from
use
other
component_4
component_22
b
connector_15
component_1
per
component_4
problem
we
have
talk
about
one
component_1
per
component_4
be
ideal
for
pattern_3
but
that
be
possible
when
the
component_2
be
greenfield
and
to
be
develop
with
ddd
but
if
the
component_2
be
a
monolith
and
try
to
break
into
pattern_3
denormalization
be
not
that
easy
what
be
the
suitable
architecture
in
that
requirement_16
solution
a
connector_15
component_1
per
component_4
be
not
ideal
but
that
be
the
work
solution
for
the
above
scenario
most
people
consider
this
an
anti
pattern_2
for
pattern_3
but
for
brownfield
component_2
this
be
a
quality_attribute_6
start
to
break
the
component_2
into
small
logical
piece
this
should
not
be
apply
for
greenfield
component_2
in
this
pattern_2
one
component_1
can
be
align
with
more
than
one
pattern_1
but
it
have
to
be
restrict
to


maximum
otherwise
quality_attribute_8
autonomy
and
independence
will
be
challenge

cqrs
problem
once
we
connector_17
component_1
per
component_4
there
be
a
requirement
to
query
which
require
joint
connector_data_5
from
multiple
component_3
—
it
s
not
possible
then
how
do
we
connector_17
connector_18
in
pattern_1
architecture
solution
cqrs
suggest
split
the
component_2
into
two
part
—
the
command
side
and
the
query
side
the
command
side
handle
the
create
update

delete
connector_data_6
the

side
handle
the

part
by

problem
when

how
do
we
ensure
connector_data_5
consistency
across
component_4
for
example
for
an
e
commerce
component_2
where
requirement_17
have
a
credit
limit
the
component_2
must
ensure
that
a
order
will
not
exceed
the
customer’s
credit
limit
since
order
and
requirement_17
be
in
different
component_1
the
component_2
cannot
simply
use
a
local
acid
transaction
solution
a
saga
represent
a

that
consist
of
several
sub
connector_data_6
which

have
a

that
be
connector_16
when
the
connector_data_6

it
can
be

in
two
way

—
when
there
be
no

provide
the
option
to
externalize
the
property
to
technology_14
and
load
them
a
environment
property
these
can
be
connector_13
by
the
component_2
on
startup
or
can
be
refresh
without
a
component_23
restart
b
component_4
discovery
pattern_2
problem
when
pattern_3
come
into
the
picture
we
need
to
connector_5
a
few
issue
in
term
of
connector_29
component_4
with
container
technology_15
ip
connector_5
be
dynamically
allocate
to
the
component_4
instance
every
time
the
connector_5
connector_19
a
component_14
component_4
can
break
and
need
manual
connector_19
each
component_4
url
have
to
be
remember
by
the
component_14
and
become
tightly
couple
so
how
do
the
component_14
or
pattern_10
all
the
quality_attribute_10
component_4
instance
and
location
solution
a
component_4
registry
need
to
be
create
which
will
keep
the
metadata
of
each
component_11
component_4
a
component_4
instance
should
register
to
the
registry
when
start
and
should
de
register
when
shut
down
the
component_14
or
pattern_10
should
query
the
registry
and
find
out
the
location
of
the
component_4
the
registry
also
need
to
do
a
health
connector_27
of
the
component_11
component_4
to
ensure
that
only
work
instance
of
the
component_3
be
quality_attribute_10
to
be
connector_30
through
it
there
be
two
type
of
component_4
discovery
component_16
side
and
component_23
side
an
example
of
component_16
side
discovery
be
netflix
eureka
and
an
example
of
component_23
side
discovery
be
technology_12
alb
technology_3
circuit
breaker
pattern_2
problem
a
component_4
generally
connector_data_8
other
component_3
to
connector_12
connector_data_5
and
there
be
the
chance
that
the
downstream
component_4
be
down
there
be
two
problem
with
this
first
the
connector_data_6
will
keep
go
to
the
down
component_4
exhaust
requirement_18
resource
and
slow
requirement_6
second
the
requirement_15
will
be
bad
and
unpredictable
how
do
we
avoid
cascade
component_4
failure
and
handle
failure
gracefully
solution
the
component_14
should
invoke
a
remote
component_4
via
a
pattern_6
that
behave
in
a
similar
fashion
to
an
electrical
circuit
breaker
when
the
number
of
consecutive
failure
cross
a
threshold
the
circuit
breaker
trip
and
for
the
duration
of
a
timeout
period
all
attempt
to
invoke
the
remote
component_4
will
fail
immediately
after
the
timeout
expire
the
circuit
breaker
allow
a
limit
number
of
test
connector_data_10
to
pass
through
if
those
connector_data_10
succeed
the
circuit
breaker
resume
normal

otherwise
if
there
be
a
failure
the
timeout
period
begin
again
netflix
hystrix
be
a
quality_attribute_6
implementation
of
the
circuit
breaker
pattern_2
it
also
help
you
to
define
a
fallback
mechanism
which
can
be
use
when
the
circuit
breaker
trip
that

pattern_2
problem
with
pattern_1
architecture
one
component_2
can
have
many
pattern_3
if
we
stop
all
the
component_3
then
quality_attribute_7
an
enhance
version
the
downtime
will
be
huge
and
can
impact
the
requirement_7
also
the
rollback
will
be
a
nightmare
how
do
we
avoid
or
reduce
downtime
of
the
component_3
during
deployment
solution
the
blue
green
deployment
strategy
can
be
connector_17
to
reduce
or
remove
downtime
it
achieve
this
by
run
two
identical
production
environment
blue
and
green

s
assume
green
be
the
exist
live
instance
and
blue
be
the
version
of
the
component_2
at
any
time
only
one
of
the
environment
be
live
with
the
live
environment
serve
all

all
