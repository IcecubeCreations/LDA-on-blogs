a

my

in

i

start
to
see
a
common
trend
across
requirement_5
of
all

they
be
start
to
realize
that
to
build
the
digital
component_10
that
will
disrupt

they
need
connector_3
to
a
wide
connector_5
of

that

however
the

all

there

for

implementation
detail
to

use

enable

all
connector_data_4

those

period

day
etc
the
key
to
technology_2
be
the
requirement_10
developer
often
connector_2
confuse
when
first
hearing
about
this
requirement_10
because
we
re
use
to
understand
requirement_10
in

of
component_2
requirement_10
what
we
re
talk
about
here
however
be
the
requirement_10
connector_data_1
connector_data_5
the
requirement_10
be
simply
a
time
order
append
only
sequence
of
connector_data_1
insert
where
the
connector_data_1
can
be
anything
in

it
s

derive

from
that
requirement_10
in

connector_data_4
be

to
a
topic
which
maintain
this
requirement_10
or
multiple
requirement_10
—
one
for
each
component_19
from
which
pattern_8
can
connector_12
and
derive
their
own
representation
of
the
connector_data_1

materialize

a

of
the
activity
for
a

could
include

derive
the
shop
cart
connector_data_6
that
represent
what
s
in
the
shop
cart
item
bar
and
ready
for
checkout
because
technology_2
can
retain
connector_data_4
for

component_8

in

an

and

it
out

what
