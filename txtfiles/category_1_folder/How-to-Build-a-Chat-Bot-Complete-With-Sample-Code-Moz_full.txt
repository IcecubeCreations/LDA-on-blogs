off
the

if
you’re

you

on

this
do
you
remember
when
it
wasn

necessary
to
have
a
when
most
board
would
scoff
at
the
requirement_12
of
run
a

now
gartner
be
tell
u
that
requirement_13
will
manage
85%
of
their
relationship
with
brand
without
connector_8
with
a
human
by
and
publication
forbes
be
say
that
chat
requirement_1
be
the
cause
the
situation
now
be
the
same
a
every
time
a
component_9
develop
if
you
don’t
have
something
your
requirement_13
can
connector_9
you
re
give
that
to
your
competition
at
the
moment
an
automate

or
slack
not
be
central
to
your
strategy
but
those
who
claim
grind
now
could
dominate
it
in
the
future
the
problem
be
time
sure
it
technology_3
be
ideal
to
be
everywhere
all
the
time
to
have
your
brand
active
on
every
component_9
but
it
would
also
be
ideal
to
catch
at
least
four
hour
sleep
a
night
or
stop
cover
our
keyboard
with
three
day
old
chili
con
carne
a
we
eat
a
hasty
lunch
in
between
build
two
of
the
next
big
thing
this
be
where
you’re
fortunate
in
two
way
when
we
develop
chat
component_10
we
don’t
have
to
worry
about
thing
a
beautiful
component_11
because
it’s
all
speech
or
text
that
s
not
to
say
you
t
need
to
worry
about
requirement_14
a
there
be
rule
and
an
art
to
design
a
quality_attribute_5
conversational
back
and
forth
be
actually
offer
some
hefty
prize
for
outstanding
example
i’ve
spend
the
last
six
month
work
through
the
step
from
complete
ignorance
to
create
a
quality_attribute_6
chat
requirement_1
and
i’m
give
you
all
my
work
in
this
i
break
down
each
of
the
level
of
complexity
from
no
back
and
forth
to
manage
component_11
credential
and
component_12
the
stretch
over
day
or
month
i’m
also
include
full
that
you
can
adapt
and
connector_10
apart
a
need
i’ve
each
portion
of
the
explain
what
it
do
and
connector_11
to
resource
where
necessary
i
ve
connector_12
more
about
the
requirement_12
of
interactive
personal
assistant
on
the
distil
so
this
win
t
spend
any
long
focus
on
why
you
should
develop
chat
requirement_1
instead
i
ll
connector_13
everything
i
ve
what
my
build
from
scratch
requirement_1
do
ever
since
i
start
investigate
chat
requirement_1
i
be
particularly
interest
in
find
out
the
answer
to
one
question
what
do
it
take
for
someone
with
little
to
no
programming
experience
to
create
one
of
these
chat
component_13
from
scratch
fortunately
i
have
direct
connector_9
to
someone
with
little
to
no
experience
before
i
have
no
idea
what
technology_4
be
and
so
i
set
about
design
my
own
requirement_1
with
the
follow
hard
condition
it
have
to
have
some
kind
of
real
world
component_10
it
didn
t
have
to
be
critical
to
a
requirement_3
but
it
do
have
to
bear
basic
component_11
need
in
mind
it
have
to
be
easily
quality_attribute_6
across
the
immediate
intend
component_11
and
to
have
reasonable
scope
to
quality_attribute_7
further
modification
at
most
rather
than
a
complete
rewrite
it
have
to
be
quality_attribute_8
enough
that
you
the
reader
can
take
some
free
and
make
your
own
chat
requirement_1
it
have
to
be
possible
to
adapt
the
skeleton
of
the
component_7
for
much
more
complex
requirement_3
requirement_4
it
have
to
be
free
to
run
but
could
have
the
option
of
pay
to
quality_attribute_2
up
or
make
life
easy
it
have
to
connector_14
connector_data_5
confirm
when
important
step
have
be
complete
the
connector_data_3
component_14
be
vietnambot
a
component_14
that
connector_15
with
slack
the
technology_5
requirement_15
linguistic
component_7
component_9
and
use
real
time
and
pattern_2
component_7
and
it
own
component_15
for
connector_16
component_11
credential
if
that
mean
nothing
to
you
t
worry
—
i
ll
define
those
thing
in
a
bit
and
the
i
m
provide
be
obsessively
with
explanation
the
thing
to
remember
be
it
do
all
of
this
to
connector_12
down
food
order
for
our
favorite
vietnamese
restaurant
in
a
connector_17
probably
connector_18
ten
of
second
of
distil
requirement_10
time
every
year
it
s
deliberately
mundane
but
it
s
design
to
be
a
template
for
far
more
complex
connector_19
the
idea
be
that
whether
you
want
to
connector_12
a
no
need
back
and
forth
through
technology_5
requirement_15
a
quality_attribute_9
technology_4
component_14
that
connector_20
connector_data_6
do
a
thing
and
connector_21
a
connector_22
or
something
that
break
out
of
the
limitation
of
linguistic
component_7
component_8
to
perform
complex
connector_19
in
component_11
component_12
that
can
last
day
this
should
give
you
some
of
the
puzzle
piece
and
point
you
to
others
what
be
technology_5
requirement_15
and
what
s
it
use
for
technology_5
requirement_15
be
a
linguistic
component_7
it
can
connector_23
text
or
speech
convert
to
text
and
perform
much
of
the
comprehension
for
you
you
can
see
my
distil
for
more
detail
but
essentially
it
take
the
phrase
“my
name
be
robin
and
i
want
noodle
today”
and
split
it
up
into
component_16
intent
food_request
action
process_food
name
robin
food
noodle
time
today
this
setup
mean
you
have
some
hope
of
respond
to
the
hundred
of
thousand
of
way
your
component_6
could
find
to
say
the
same
thing
it’s
your
choice
whether
technology_5
requirement_15
connector_20
a
connector_data_7
and
respond
to
the
component_11
right
away
or
whether
it
connector_20
a
connector_data_7
from
a
component_11
categorize
it
and
connector_21
it
to
your
component_10
then
wait
for
your
component_10
to
respond
before
connector_24
your
application’s
connector_22
back
to
the
component_11
who
make
the
original
connector_data_8
in
it
quality_attribute_9
form
the
component_9
have
a
bunch
of
one
click
requirement_16
and
require
no
i’ve
connector_data_1
the
possible
level
of
complexity
below
but
it’s
worth
bear
some
hard
limitation
in
mind
which
apply
to
most
of
these
component_17
they
cannot
remember
anything
outside
of
a
component_11
component_18
which
will
automatically
end
after
about
minute
they
have
to
do
everything
through
what
be
connector_25
and
connector_3
connector_data_9
something
you
can
ignore
unless
you’re
use
and
if
you
do
choose
to
have
it
ask
your
component_10
for
connector_data_6
before
it
respond
to
the
component_11
you
have
to
do
everything
and
respond
within
five
second
what
be
the
other
thing
slack
a
text
base
pattern_3
component_9
design
for
work
or
for
distract
people
from
work
we
all
this
but
in
requirement_4
it’s
online
pattern_2
component_7
most
of
the
time
one
component_14
can
do
one
thing
at
a
time
even
if
it
ask
another
component_14
to
do
something
it
normally
stop
and
wait
for
the
connector_22
pattern_2
component_7
be
how
we
ask
a
question
and
continue
without
wait
for
the
answer
possibly
connector_26
that
answer
at
a
late
time
component_15
again
it’s
likely
you
this
but
if
not
it’s
that
our
will
use
different
from
the
technology_6
a
component_9
for
run
online
important
to
note
i
don’t
work
for
technology_7
and
haven’t
be
pay
by
them
i
couldn’t
say
that
it
s
the
best
component_9
but
it
can
be
free
and
a
of
now
it’s
the
one
i’m
most
familiar
with
how
easy
be
it
this
graph
isn
t
terribly
scientific
and
it
s
from
the
perspective
of
someone
who
s
much
of
this
for
the
first
time
so
here’s
an
approximate
breakdown
label
requirement_17
time
it
take
me
you
set
up
the
conversation
purely
through
technology_5
requirement_15
or
similar
no
external
need
for
instance
answer
set
question
about
detail
or
opening
time
half
an
hour
to
quality_attribute_6
prototype
a
component_14
that
connector_20
connector_data_6
from
technology_5
requirement_15
and
u
that
connector_data_6
to
update
the
correct
cell
in
a
but
can’t
remember
component_11
name
and
can’t
use
the
slow
requirement_16
a
few
week
to
quality_attribute_6
prototype
a
component_14
that
remember
component_11
name
once
they
ve
be
set
and
connector_27
them
to
be
limit
to
five
second
component_7
time
by
technology_5
requirement_15
so
can’t
use
the
slow
requirement_16
and
not
work
quality_attribute_10
when
the
component_19
have
to
boot
up
from
sleep
because
that
take
a
few
second
of
your
allocation*
a
few
week
on
top
of
the
last
prototype
a
component_14
that
remember
component_11
detail
and
manage
the
connector_28
between
technology_5
requirement_15
and
our
chosen
component_9
in
this
requirement_4
slack
so
it
can
break
out
of
the
five
second
component_7
window
a
few
week
more
on
top
of
the
last
prototype
not
include
the
time
need
to
rewrite
exist
connector_data_10
to
work
with
this
*on
the
technology_7
free
plan
when
your
component_19
hasn’t
be
use
for
minute
it
go
to
sleep
this
mean
that
the
first
time
it’s
activate
it
take
a
little
while
to
start
your
component_7
which
can
be
a
problem
if
you
have
a
short
window
in
which
to
act
you
could
connector_3
around
this
by
mi
use
a
free
“uptime
pattern_4
service”
which
connector_21
a
connector_data_8
every
so
often
to
keep
your
component_19
awake
if
you
choose
this
in
order
to
avoid
use
all
of
the
technology_7
free
hour
allocation
by
the
end
of
the
month
you’ll
need
to
register
your
card
no
charge
it
connector_29
you
extra
hour
and
only
run
this
component_10
on
the
account
alternatively
there
be
any
number
of
requirement_10
happy
to
take
your
money
to
keep
your
component_19
alive
for
the
rest
of
this
i’m
go
to
break
down
each
of
those
key
step
and
either
give
an
overview
of
how
you
could
achieve
it
or
point
you
in
the
direction
of
where
you
can
find
that
the
i’m
give
you
be
technology_4
but
a
long
a
you
can
connector_23
and
respond
to
connector_3
and
connector_data_8
you
can
do
it
in
pretty
much
whatever
technology_8
you
wish
design
your
conversation
conversational
flow
be
an
art
form
in
itself
jonathan

director

s
requirement_15
thinktank
have
give
some
great
talk
on
the
topic
paul
pangaro
have
also
speak
about
conversation
a
more
than
in
multiple
your
first
step
be
to
create
a
flow
requirement_18
of
the
conversation
connector_12
out
your
ideal
conversation
then
connector_12
out
the
most
likely
way
a
person
might
go
off
track
and
how
you’d
deal
with
them
then
go
online
find
exist
chat
requirement_1
and
do
everything
you
can
to
break
them
connector_12
out
the
most
difficult
obtuse
and
nonsensical
connector_22
you
can
connector_30
with
them
you’re
six
glass
of
wine
in
and
try
to
order
a
lemon
engrave
technology_9
connector_30
with
them
a
though
you’ve
find
charge
on
your
card
for
a
lemon
engraver
you
definitely
didn’t
buy
and
you
be
livid
connector_30
with
them
you’re
a
bore
teenager
at
every
point
connector_12
down
what
you
try
to
do
to
break
them
and
what
the
connector_22
be
then
apply
that
to
your
flow
then
connector_3
someone
else
to
try
to
break
your
flow
give
them
no
connector_data_6
whatsoever
apart
from
the
connector_22
you’ve
connector_12
down
not
even
what
the
requirement_1
be
design
for
refuse
to
answer
any
input
you
don’t
have
connector_12
down
and
see
how
it
go
david
low
principal
evangelist
for
alexa
often
describe
the
requirement_12
of
printing
out
a
script
and
test
the
back
and
forth
for
a
conversation
a
well
a
help
to
avoid
gap
it’ll
also
show
you
where
you’re
connector_31
a
huge
amount
of
connector_data_6
on
the
component_11
while
“best
practices”
be
still
develop
for
chat
requirement_1
a
common
theme
be
that
it’s
not
a
quality_attribute_5
idea
to
pretend
your
requirement_1
be
a
person
be
upfront
that
it’s
a
requirement_1
—
component_6
will
find
out
anyway
likewise
it’s
incredibly
frustrate
to
open
a
chat
and
have
no
idea
what
to
say
on
text
component_9
start
with
a
welcome
connector_data_7
make
it
clear
you’re
a
requirement_1
and
give
example
of
thing
you
can
do
on
component_8
home
and
alexa
component_6
will
expect
a
component_14
but
the
“things
i
can
do”
bit
be
still
important
enough
that
your
requirement_1
won’t
be
approve
without
this
opening
phase
i
ve
include
a
sample
conversational
flow
for
vietnambot
at
the
end
of
this
a
one
way
to
approach
it
although
if
you
have
idea
for
alternative
conversational
connector_data_10
i’d
be
interest
in
connector_32
them
in
the
a
final
piece
of
advice
on
conversation
the
trick
here
be
to
find
organic
way
of
control
the
possible
input
and
prepare
for
unexpected
input
that
be
say
the
alexa
evangelist
team
provide
an
example
of
terrible
requirement_14
in
which
a
bank’s
component_19
say
“if
you
want
to
continue
say
nine
”
quite
often
question
rather
than
instruction
be
the
key
create
a
conversation
in
technology_5
requirement_15
technology_5
requirement_15
have
quite
a
lot
of
documentation
explain
how
to
create
component_20
here
so
i
won’t
go
over
individual
step
key
thing
to
understand
you
create
agent
each
be
basically
a
different
component_14
agent
recognize
intent
which
be
simply
way
of
connector_33
a
specific
connector_22
if
someone
say
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
they
meet
criterion
you
have
set
fall
into
an
intent
and
connector_3
a
pre
set
connector_22
the
right
thing
to
say
be
include
in
the
“user
says”
section
screenshot
below
you
set
either
exact
phrase
or
connector_data_11
of
option
a
the
necessary
input
for
instance
a
component_11
could
connector_12
“of
i’m
any
name
”
or
“of
i’m
any
pattern_5
”
you
could
set
up
one
intent
for
name
be
which
match
“of
i’m
give
name
”
and
another
intent
for
pattern_5
which
match
“of
i’m
pattern_5
”
and
quality_attribute_3
on
whether
your
component_11
connector_27
a
name
or
pattern_5
in
that
final
block
you
could
activate
either
the
“name
is”
or
“temperature
is”
intent
the
“right
time”
be
define
by
component_21
component_21
help
define
whether
an
intent
will
be
activate
but
be
also
create
by
certain
intent
i’ve
include
a
screenshot
below
of
an
example
connector_19
in
this
example
the
component_11
say
that
they
would
to
go
to
on
holiday
this
activate
a
holiday
intent
and
set
the
holiday
component_21
you
can
see
in
input
component_21
below
after
that
our
component_17
will
have
automatically
respond
with
the
question
“where
would
you
to
go
”
when
our
component_11
say
“the”
and
then
any
location
it
activate
our
holiday
location
intent
because
it
match
both
the
component_21
and
what
the
component_11
say
if
on
the
other
hand
the
component_11
have
initially
say
“i
want
to
go
to
the
theater
”
that
might
have
activate
the
theater
intent
which
would
set
a
theater
component_21
—
so
when
we
ask
“what
area
of
theater
be
you
interest
in
”
and
the
component_11
say
“the
location
”
or
even
“
location
”
we
will
take
them
down
a
completely
different
path
of
suggest
theater
rather
than
hotel
in
rome
the
way
you
can
create
conversation
without
ever
use
external
be
by
use
these
component_21
a
component_11
might
say
“what
time
be
you
open
”
you
could
set
an
open
time
inquiry
component_21
in
your
connector_22
you
could
give
the
time
and
ask
if
they
want
the
phone
number
to
you
you
would
then
make
a
yes
no
intent
which
match
the
component_21
you
have
set
so
if
your
component_11
say
“yes”
you
respond
with
the
number
this
could
be
set
up
within
an
hour
but
connector_29
exponentially
more
complex
when
you
need
to
respond
to
specific
part
of
the
connector_data_7
for
instance
if
you
have
different
shop
location
and
want
to
give
the
right
phone
number
without
have
to
connector_12
out
every
possible
location
they
could
say
in
technology_5
requirement_15
you’ll
need
to
quality_attribute_11
with
external
see
section
three
now
there
will
be
time
when
your
component_6
don’t
say
what
you
re
expect
exclude
component_21
there
be
three
very
important
way
to
deal
with
that
almost
keyword
research
—
plan
out
a
many
possible
variation
of
say
the
same
thing
a
possible
and
put
them
all
into
the
intent
test
test
test
test
test
test
test
test
test
test
test
test
test
test
test
when
launch
every
chat
requirement_1
will
have
problem
keep
test
keep
update
keep
improve
fallback
component_21
fallback
component_21
don’t
have
a
component_11
say
section
but
can
be
component_22
in
by
component_21
they
match
anything
that
have
the
right
component_21
but
doesn’t
match
any
of
your
component_11
say
it
could
be
tempt
to
use
fallback
intent
a
a
catch
all
reason
along
the
line
of
“this
be
the
only
thing
they’ll
say
so
we’ll
treat
it
the
same”
be
understandable
but
it
open
up
a
massive
hole
in
the
component_7
fallback
intent
be
design
to
be
a
conversational
quality_attribute_12
net
they
operate
exactly
the
same
a
in
a
normal
conversation
if
a
person
ask
what
you
want
in
your
tea
and
you
respond
“i
don’t
want
tea”
and
that
person
make
a
cup
of
tea
connector_12
the
word
“i
don’t
want
tea”
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
put
it
in
that
be
not
a
person
you’d
want
to
connector_30
with
again
if
we
be
use
fallback
intent
to
do
anything
we
need
to
preface
it
with
a
connector_2
if
we
have
to
resort
to
it
in
the
example
above
say
“i
think
you
ask
me
to
i
don’t
want
tea
to
your
tea
be
that
right
”
be
clunky
and
robotic
but
it’s
a
big
step
connector_34
and
you
can
travel
the
rest
of
the
way
by
perfect
other
part
of
your
conversation
quality_attribute_11
with
external
i
use
technology_7
to
build
my
component_19
use
this
excellent
weather
webhook
example
you
can
actually
quality_attribute_13
a
requirement_1
to
technology_7
within
minute
i
find
this
example
particularly
useful
a
something
i
could
pick
apart
to
make
my
own
connector_data_12
and
connector_22
component_14
the
weather
webhook
take
the
connector_data_6
and
connector_data_13
a
yahoo
component_19
but
ignore
that
specific
requirement_17
you
essentially
need
the
follow
if
you’re
work
in
technology_4
#start
req
=
connector_data_8
get_json
connector_data_8
technology_10
connector_data_14
req
indent=4
#process
to
do
your
thing
and
decide
what
connector_22
should
be
re
=
processrequest
req
#
connector_22
we
should
connector_23
from
processrequest
you’ll
need
to
connector_12
some
connector_25
processrequest
and
make
it
the
below
the
weather
webhook
example
above
be
a
quality_attribute_5
one
{
speech
“speech
we
want
to
connector_14
back”
displaytext
“display
text
we
want
to
connector_14
back
usually
match
speech”
component_23
your
component_19
name
}
#
make
our
connector_22
readable
by
technology_5
requirement_15
and
connector_24
it
back
to
the
servic
connector_22
=
make_response
re
connector_22
content
type
=
component_10
technology_10
connector_22
#
end
a
long
a
you
can
connector_23
and
respond
to
connector_data_9
that
or
in
the
equivalent
for
technology_11
other
than
technology_4
your
component_19
and
technology_5
requirement_15
should
both
understand
each
other
perfectly
—
what
you
do
in
the
interim
to
connector_7
the
world
or
make
your
connector_22
be
entirely
up
to
you
the
i
have
include
be
a
little
different
from
this
because
it
s
also
design
to
be
the
step
in
between
slack
and
technology_5
requirement_15
however
i
have
heavily
section
process_food
and
the
component_15
connector_19
component_7
with
both
explanation
and
connector_32
component_23
those
should
help
you
make
it
your
own
if
you
want
to
repurpose
my
component_14
to
work
within
that
five
second
window
i
would
forget
about
the
connector_25
component_19
py
and
aim
to
copy
whole
component_24
from
connector_data_15
py
paste
them
into
a
component_14
base
on
the
weatherhook
example
above
and
go
from
there
initially
i
technology_3
recommend
try
gspread
to
make
some
connector_35
to
a
test
spreadsheet
that
way
you’ll
connector_3
visible
feedback
on
how
well
your
component_10
be
run
you’ll
need
to
go
through
the
pattern_6
step
a
they
be
explain
here
use
a
component_15
component_15
be
pretty
easy
to
set
up
in
technology_6
i
choose
the
postgres
on
you
need
to
pattern_7
your
account
with
a
card
it
won’t
charge
you
anything
and
then
you
click
to
install
in
the
section
of
my
i’ve
include
connector_5
to
useful
resource
which
help
me
figure
out
how
to
connector_3
the
component_15
up
and
run
—
for
example
this
i
use
the
technology_4
technology_12
technology_13
to
connector_30
with
the
component_15
to
steal
some
example
of
use
it
in
have
a
look
at
the
section
entitle
“synchronous
functions”
in
either
the
component_19
py
or
connector_data_15
py
open_db_connection
and
close_db_connection
do
exactly
what
they
say
on
the
tin
open
and
close
the
connector_28
with
the
component_15
you
tell
check_database
to
connector_2
a
specific
column
for
a
specific
component_11
and
it
give
you
the
requirement_12
while
update_columns
a
requirement_12
to
specify
column
for
a
certain
component_11
component_5
where
thing
haven’t
work
straightaway
i’ve
include
connector_5
to
the
component_2
where
i
find
my
solution
one
thing
to
bear
in
mind
be
that
i’ve
use
a
way
of
include
column
a
a
variable
which
technology_13
recommend
quite
strongly
against
i’ve
connector_3
away
with
it
so
far
because
i
m
always
connector_36
out
the
specific
column
name
elsewhere
—
i’m
use
that
a
a
short
cut
component_7
outside
of
technology_5
artificial_intelligence’s
five
second
window
it
need
to
be
say
that
this
step
complicate
thing
by
no
small
amount
it
also
make
it
hard
to
quality_attribute_11
with
different
component_10
rather
than
flick
a
switch
to
roll
out
through
technology_5
requirement_15
you
have
to
connector_12
the
that
interpret
pattern_8
and
component_11
specific
connector_data_5
for
each
component_9
you
re
quality_attribute_11
with
what’s
more
speak
only
component_8
home
and
alexa
don’t
allow
for
this
kind
of
circumvention
of
the
rule
—
you
have
to
sit
within
that
5–8
second
window
so
this
remove
those
option
the
only
reason
you
should
need
to
take
the
requirement_16
away
from
technology_5
requirement_15
be
you
want
to
use
it
to
work
with
a
component_9
that
it
doesn’t
have
an
requirement_16
with
it
currently
have
requirement_16
include
messenger
twitter
slack
and
home
it
also
allow
export
your
conversation
in
an
alexa
understandable
technology_8
have
their
own
similar
and
a
bunch
of
instruction
on
how
to
build
a
skill
—
here
be
an
example
you
be
component_7
mass
of
connector_data_6
i’m
talk
really
large
amount
some
flight
comparison
sit
have
have
problem
fit
within
the
timeout
limit
of
these
component_9
but
if
you
aren’t
try
to
component_7
every
detail
for
every
flight
for
the
next
month
and
it’s
take
more
than
five
second
it’s
probably
go
to
be
easy
to
make
your
more
quality_attribute_14
than
work
outside
the
window
even
if
you
be
those
same
flight
comparison
sit
solve
the
problem
by
create
a
component_7
that
regularly
connector_37
their
full
connector_data_2
set
and
create
a
small
pool
of
connector_data_6
that’s
more
quickly
quality_attribute_15
you
need
to
connector_14
multiple
follow
up
connector_data_5
to
your
component_11
when
use
the
technology_5
requirement_15
requirement_16
it’s
pretty
much
connector_data_12
and
connector_22
you
don’t
always
connector_3
connector_9
to
thing
pattern_6
connector_data_16
which
be
what
some
pattern_3
component_8
require
before
you
can
automatically
connector_14
connector_data_5
to
one
of
their
component_11
you
re
work
with
another
component_14
that
can
be
quite
slow
or
there
be
technical
limitation
to
your
setup
this
one
apply
to
vietnambot
i
use
the
gspread
technology_12
in
my
component_10
which
be
fantastic
but
can
be
slow
to
connector_10
out
big
chunk
of
connector_data_2
what’s
more
technology_7
can
take
a
little
while
to
start
up
if
you’re
not
pay
i
could
have
pay
or
cut
out
some
of
the
requirement_17
to
avoid
need
to
manage
this
part
of
the
component_7
but
that
would
have
fail
to
meet
number
in
our
original
condition
it
have
to
be
possible
to
adapt
the
skeleton
of
the
component_7
for
much
more
complex
requirement_3
requirement_4
if
you
decide
you’d
rather
use
my
component_14
within
that
five
second
window
skip
back
to
section
of
this
otherwise
keep
connector_6
when
we
break
out
of
the
five
second
technology_5
requirement_15
window
we
have
to
do
a
couple
of
thing
first
thing
be
to
flip
the
component_7
on
it
head
what
we
be
do
before
component_11
connector_21
connector_data_7
technology_5
requirement_15
our
component_7
technology_5
requirement_15
component_11
what
we
need
to
do
now
component_11
connector_21
connector_data_7
our
component_7
technology_5
requirement_15
our
component_7
component_11
instead
of
technology_5
requirement_15
wait
while
we
do
our
component_7
we
do
some
component_7
wait
for
technology_5
requirement_15
to
categorize
the
connector_data_7
from
u
do
a
bit
more
component_7
then
connector_data_7
the
component_11
the
way
this
apply
to
vietnambot
be
component_11
say
“i
want
food
”
slack
connector_21
a
connector_data_7
to
my
component_19
on
technology_7
my
component_19
connector_21
a
“swift
and
confident”
connector_22
to
slack
to
prevent
it
from
resending
the
connector_data_7
to
connector_14
the
connector_22
my
component_7
have
to
shut
down
so
before
it
do
that
it
activate
a
secondary
component_7
use
connector_data_15
the
secondary
component_7
take
the
query
text
and
connector_21
it
to
technology_5
requirement_15
then
connector_29
back
the
connector_22
the
secondary
component_7
connector_37
our
component_15
for
a
component_11
name
if
we
don’t
have
one
connector_38
it
connector_21
another
connector_data_8
to
technology_5
requirement_15
put
it
in
the
“we
don’t
have
a
name”
component_21
and
connector_21
a
connector_data_7
to
our
component_11
ask
for
their
name
that
way
when
our
component_11
respond
with
their
name
technology_5
requirement_15
be
already
prim
to
interpret
it
correctly
because
we’ve
set
the
right
component_21
see
section
of
this
technology_5
requirement_15
tell
u
that
the
late
connector_data_7
be
a
component_11
name
and
we
connector_38
it
when
we
have
both
the
component_11
name
and
food
whether
we’ve
connector_3
it
from
the
component_15
or
connector_38
it
to
the
component_15
vietnambot
the

to
our
calculate

we’ve
reach
the

minimum
for
that
day
and
connector_21
a
final
success
connector_data_7
quality_attribute_11
with
slack
this
won’t
be
the
same
a
quality_attribute_11
with
other
pattern_3
component_17
but
it
could
give
some
insight
into
what
might
be
require
elsewhere
slack
have
two
pattern_6
component_7
we’ll
connector_data_12
one
challenge
and
the
other
pattern_8
slack
include
instruction
for
an
component_19
lifecycle
here
but
technology_5
requirement_15
actually
have
excellent
instruction
for
how
to
set
up
your
component_19
a
a
first
step
create
a
quality_attribute_9
back
and
forth
conversation
in
technology_5
requirement_15
not
your
full
technology_1
go
to
requirement_16
switch
on
slack
and
run
through
the
step
to
set
it
up
once
that
be
up
and
work
you’ll
need
to
connector_7
the
oauth
url
and
the
url
to
be
the
url
for
your
component_19
thanks
to
technology_14
component_11
karishay
my
component_19
include
a
component_7
for
respond
to
the
challenge
component_7
which
will
tell
slack
you’re
set
up
to
connector_23
and
for
run
through
the
pattern_8
component_7
use
our
establish
component_15
to
connector_38
important
component_11
connector_data_16
there’s
also
the
option
to
connector_38
them
to
a
if
you
haven’t
connector_3
the
component_15
establish
yet
however
be
wary
of
this
a
anything
other
than
a
first
step
—
component_11
connector_data_16
give
an
component_19
a
lot
of
power
and
have
to
be
guard
carefully
pattern_2
component_7
we
be
run
our
component_19
use
technology_15
which
be
basically
a
whole
bunch
of
we
can
connector_data_12
upon
to
deal
with
thing
connector_39
connector_data_9
for
connector_data_6
over
the
internet
in
order
to
create
a
secondary
component_25
component_7
i
ve
use
technology_16
and
technology_17
technology_16
be
our
“message
broker”
it
make
make
a
connector_data_1
of
everything
we
want
our
secondary
component_7
to
do
technology_17
run
through
that
connector_data_1
and
make
our
component_25
component_7
do
those
connector_data_17
in
sequence
technology_16
be
a
note
leave
on
the
fridge
tell
you
to
do
your
wash
and
take
out
the
bin
while
technology_17
be
the
housemate
that
bang
on
your
bedroom
door
note
in
hand
and
make
you
do
each
thing
i’m
sure
our
component_25
component_7
doesn’t
technology_17
very
much
but
it’s
really
useful
for
u
you
can
find
instruction
for
technology_16
to
your
component_19
in
technology_7
here
and
you
can
find
advice
on
set
up
technology_17
in
technology_7
here
miguel
grinberg’s
use
technology_17
with
technology_15
be
also
an
excellent
resource
but
use
the
exact
setup
he
give
connector_data_18
in
a
clash
with
our
component_15
so
it
s
easy
to
stick
with
the
technology_7
version
up
until
this
point
we
ve
be
connector_40
in
our
component_19
—
anything
of
the
form
function_name
argument_1
argument_2
argument_3
now
by
put
“tasks
”
in
front
of
our
we’re
say
“don’t
do
this
now
—
hand
it
to
the
secondary
component_7
that’s
because
we’ve
do
a
few
thing
we’ve
create
connector_data_15
py
which
be
the
secondary
component_7
basically
it
s
one
big
long
that
our
tell
to
run
in
connector_data_15
py
we’ve
include
technology_17
in
our
and
set
our
component_19
a
technology_17
technology_17
mean
that
when
we
use
“app”
late
we’re
essentially
say
“this
be
part
of
our
technology_17
list”
or
rather
“tasks
py
will
only
do
anything
when
it
flatmate
technology_17
come
bang
on
the
door”
for
every
time
our
component_7
ask
for
an
pattern_2
by
connector_36
connector_data_15
any_function_name
we
have
create
that
in
our
secondary
component_14
a
we
would
if
it
be
in
the
same
however
in
our
secondary
component_14
we’ve
preface
with
“@app
task”
another
way
of
say
“do
wash_the_dishes
when
technology_17
come
bang
the
door
yell
wash_the_dishes
dish
water
heat
resentment
”
in
our
“procfile”
include
a
a
in
my
we
have
connector_data_1
our
component_25
component_7
a
app=tasks
component_19
all
this
up
to
the
follow
component_7
component_14
run
until
it
hit
an
pattern_2
component_14
fire
off
a
connector_data_7
to
technology_16
which
have
a
connector_data_1
of
work
to
be
do
the
component_7
doesn’t
wait
it
run
through
everything
after
it
and
in
our
requirement_4
even
shut
down
the
technology_17
part
of
our
component_25
component_14
go
to
technology_16
and
connector_37
for
the
late
update
it
connector_37
what
have
be
connector_25
because
our
component_25
be
name
the
same
a
when
our
component_7
connector_25
them
it
give
our
component_25
all
the
connector_data_6
to
start
do
that
thing
and
tell
it
to
connector_3
go
our
component_25
component_7
start
the
action
it
have
be
tell
to
do
then
shut
down
a
with
the
other
topic
mention
here
i’ve
include
all
of
this
in
the
i’ve
supply
along
with
many
of
the
component_26
use
to
gather
the
connector_data_6
—
so
feel
free
to
use
the
component_24
i
have
also
feel
free
to
improve
on
them
a
i
say
the
requirement_12
of
this
investigation
be
that
i
be
not
a
coder
any
suggestion
for
tweak
or
improvement
to
the
be
very
much
welcome
conclusion
a
i
mention
in
the
introduction
to
this
there
s
huge
opportunity
for
individual
and
organization
to
gain
grind
by
create
conversational
connector_19
for
the
general
for
the
vast
majority
of
requirement_4
you
could
be
up
and
run
in
a
few
hour
to
a
few
day
quality_attribute_3
on
how
complex
you
want
your
connector_19
to
be
and
how
comfortable
you
be
with
cod
technology_11
there
be
some
stumble
block
out
there
but
hopefully
this
and
my
obsessively
annotate
can
act
a
template
and
signpost
to
help
connector_3
you
on
your
way
connector_41
my
at
technology_18
bonus
#1
the
conversational
flow
for
my
chat
requirement_1
this
be
by
no
mean
necessarily
the
best
or
only
way
to
approach
this
connector_19
this
be
design
to
be
a
streamline
an
connector_19
a
possible
but
we’re
also
work
within
the
restriction
of
the
component_9
and
the
time
investment
necessary
to
produce
this
common
wisdom
be
to
create
the
flow
of
your
conversation
and
then
keep
test
to
perfect
so
consider
this
example
layout
a
step
in
that
component_7
i’d
also
recommend
put
one
of
these
flow
requirement_18
together
before
start
—
otherwise
you
could
find
yourself
have
to
redo
a
bunch
of
work
to
accommodate
a
quality_attribute_5
back
and
forth
bonus
#2
general
thing
i
put
this
together
a
i
mention
above
this
have
be
a
project
of
go
from
complete
ignorance
of
cod
to
slightly
le
ignorance
i
be
not
a
professional
coder
but
i
find
the
follow
thing
i
pick
up
to
be
hugely
useful
while
i
be
start
out
everything
you’ll
probably
see
my
be
border
on
excessive
anything
after
a
#
be
a
while
normally
i’m
sure
someone
wouldn’t
want
to
include
a
bunch
of
technology_19
overflow
connector_5
in
their
i
find
note
about
what
thing
portion
of
be
try
to
do
and
where
i
connector_3
the
reason
from
hugely
helpful
a
i
try
to
wrap
my
head
around
it
all
everything
in
technology_4
everything
within
“print
”
will
be
out
in
the
component_19
requirement_5
see
the
command
tip
for
connector_32
them
in
technology_6
while
printing
each
action
can
mean
you
fill
up
a
requirement_5
window
terribly
quickly
i
start
use
the
technology_7
on
logdna
towards
the
end
and
it’s
a
huge
step
up
in
term
of
ease
of
connector_32
and
length
of
history
often
the
time
my
component_19
be
fall
over
be
because
one
specific
wasn’t
connector_42
what
it
need
or
because
of
another
stupid
typo
have
a
semi
constant
connector_43
of
action
and
output
requirement_5
mean
i
could
find
the
fault
much
more
quickly
my
next
step
would
probably
be
to
introduce
a
way
of
easily
switch
on
and
off
the
le
necessary
the
follow
command
heroku’s
how
to
documentation
for
create
an
component_19
and
be
pretty
great
but
i
find
myself
use
these
all
the
time
so
think
i’d
connector_13
all
of
the
below
be
connector_12
in
the
command
line
type
cmd
in
on
window
or
by
run
terminal
on
a
mac
cd
“””
location
”””
select
the
your
be
in
“git
init”
create
a
git
to
to
“git
”
all
of
the
in
your
into
the
that
git
will
put
online
“git
connector_44
m
“
description
of
what
you’re
do
”
“
connector_38
the
connector_data_2
in
your
git
“heroku
git
remote
a
the
name
of
your
component_19
”
select
your
component_19
a
where
to
put
the
“git
connector_45
technology_6
master”
connector_14
your
to
the
component_19
you
selected
“heroku
ps”
find
out
whether
your
component_19
be
run
or
crash
“heroku
logs”
apologize
to
your
other
half
for
go
totally
unresponsive
for
the
last
ten
minute
and
start
the
component_7
of
work
through
your
printout
to
see
what
have
go
wrong
connector_data_9
will
always
wait
for
a
connector_22
seem
really
basic
—
initially
i
think
that
by
connector_24
a
connector_data_8
and
not
tell
my
component_10
to
wait
for
a
connector_22
i’d
be
able
to
basically
pattern_9
potato
work
around
and
not
worry
about
have
to
finish
what
i
be
do
that’s
not
how
it
work
in
general
and
it’s
more
of
a
symbol
of
my
naivete
in
programming
than
anything
else
if
something
be
really
difficult
it’s
very
likely
you’re
do
it
wrong
while
i
make
sure
to
do
pretty
much
all
of
the
actual
work
myself
to
avoid
simply
farm
it
out
to
the
very
talented
individual
at
distil
i
be
lucky
enough
to
connector_3
some
really
valuable
advice
the
piece
of
advice
above
be
from
dominic
woodman
and
i
should
have
listen
to
it
more
the
time
when
i
make
least
progress
be
when
i
be
try
to
use
thing
the
way
they
shouldn’t
be
use
even
when
i
break
through
those
wall
i
late
find
that
someone
didn’t
want
me
to
use
it
that
way
because
it
would
completely
fail
at
a
late
point
tactical
retreat
be
an
option
at
this
point
