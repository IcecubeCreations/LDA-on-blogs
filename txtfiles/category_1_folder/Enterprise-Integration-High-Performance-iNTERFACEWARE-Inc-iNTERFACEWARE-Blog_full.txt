welcome
to
the
second
entry
in
our
series
“enterprise
requirement_2
consideration
for
healthcare
organizations”
in
our
first
we
identify
a
connector_data_1
of
top
consideration
for
organization
with
large
quality_attribute_1
high
volume
deployment
base
on
feedback
from
our
requirement_4
for
this
week’s
installment
we
will
take
a
close
look
at
one
of
those
key
consideration
high
requirement_3
healthcare
organization
today
be
face
with
quality_attribute_2
an
increasing
number
of
component_2
component_3
and
component_4
both
internally
and
externally
a
a
connector_data_2
these
organization
must
be
able
to
component_5
much
large
volume
of
connector_data_3
and
do
so
in
a
quality_attribute_3
and
quality_attribute_4
manner
not
to
mention
in
a
cost
quality_attribute_5
fashion
a
well
the
need
for
a
high
requirement_3
requirement_2
component_1
seem
obvious
when
it
come
to
requirement_1
requirement_2
consideration
but
it
be
surprisingly
often
overlook
at
a
minimum
organization
who
be
evaluate
the
requirement_3
of
an
requirement_2
component_1
should
consider
the
follow
connector_data_4
quality_attribute_6
–
can
the
requirement_2
component_1
handle
your
organization’s
current
connector_data_4
volume
an
requirement_1
requirement_2
solution
must
be
capable
of
consistently
handle
your
organization’s
peak
connector_data_4
volume
without
any
requirement_3
degradation
quality_attribute_7
–
be
the
requirement_2
component_1
capable
of
quality_attribute_8
with
your
organization
a
your
organization
grow
the
pattern_1
traffic
both
in
size
and
volume
your
requirement_2
component_1
must
handle
will
significantly
increase
hardware
requirement
–
what
be
the
hardware
cost
require
to
meet
your
organization’s
requirement_3
need
many
requirement_2
component_6
can
component_5
high
volume
of
connector_data_5
give
powerful
enough
hardware
it
be
important
to
take
the
hardware
cost
into
account
particular
a
your
organization
grow
a
they
vary
greatly

component_1
iguana
requirement_3
benchmark
we
recently
conduct
a
series
of
test
to
measure
the
iguana’s
requirement_3
for
a
variety
of
type
across
three
different
component_7
configuration
in
each
test
iguana
run
multiple
pattern_2
where
each
pattern_2
be
connector_1
random
traffic
the
volume
of
traffic
connector_1
to
each
pattern_2
be
randomize
but
cap
at
the
number
mark
imp
input
connector_data_5
per
second
in
these
test
the
number
of
pattern_2
and
imp
be
adjust
until
the
high
quality_attribute_9
requirement_3
be
reach
in
other
word
the
instance
could
handle
traffic
at
these
level
indefinitely
without
a
connector_data_4
backlog

face
