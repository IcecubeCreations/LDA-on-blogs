it
come
to
identify
a

financial
requirement_1
connector_data_1

there
be
a
few
thing
you
need
to
so
that
you
what
kind
of
connector_data_1
you’re
connector_5
and
how
to
best
work
with
it
or
maybe
choose
a
different
technology_2
now
that
i’ve
be
in
the
requirement_1
connector_data_1
requirement_2
for
some
time
now
and
have
come
from
an
asset
manager
previously
i
have
a
much
quality_attribute_8
appreciation
for
a
lot
of
nuance
that
sometimes
be
overlook
even
more
than
the
quality
which
be
also
often
overlook
let’s
look
into
it
adjust
vs
unadjusted
historical
pricesthis
be
oddly
enough
one
of
the
big
mistake
i
see
people
especially
investor
requirement_1
can
have
thing
connector_6
“corporate
actions”
that
can
retroactively
affect
the
close
requirement_9
of
a
requirement_1
once
these
corporate
action
happen
all
the
historical
connector_data_1
of
the
underlie
requirement_10
or
ticker
need
to
be
update
to
make
up
for
this
this
be

a
the
“adjusted
price”
or
“adjusted
close”
and
be
consider
to
be
the
“true
close
price”
of
a
requirement_1
one
example
of
a
corporate
action
be
a
requirement_1
split
a
2–1
requirement_1
split
would
mean
that
a
requirement_10
decide
to
double
the
number
of
connector_7
everyone
have
and
also
cut
the
requirement_9
of
that
connector_8
in
half
you
can
connector_9
more
about
why
they
would
want
to
do
this
here
now
if
you
owned

connector_7
of
tsla
at
$200
you
now
own

connector_7
at
$100
but
the
total
requirement_11
of
each
be
still
$2

what
a
wonky
graph
when
this
happen
a
requirement_1
component_2
technology_2
will
have
to
go
back
and
adjust
all
the
requirement_9
for
this
corporate
action
so
that
they
be
cut
in
half
ideally
an
component_2
would
provide
both
an
“adjusted
close”
and
an
“unadjusted
close”
a
well
a
when
corporate
action
happen
if
you
be
to
build
a
strategy
around
unadjusted
close
requirement_9
you’d
see
wild
connector_10
in
requirement_9
that
would
cause
your
requirement_9
prediction
to
go

a

on
what
you’re

for

strategy
but
it’s
important
for
you
to

when
you
connector_5
your

you
need
to
whether
that
requirement_9
connector_data_1
be

if
you
connector_5
the

exchange
but
never
requirement_6
on
that
exchange
then
your
connector_data_1
will
always
be
off
on
the
other
hand
if
you
don’t
really
care
what
exchange
you
requirement_6
on
it
will
probably
be
cheap
and
a
quality_attribute_8
representation
of
the
requirement_1
if
you
connector_5
aggregate
connector_data_1
aggregation
can
be
advantageous
because
it
give
a
quality_attribute_8
requirement_9
indicator
of
the
requirement_1
a
a
whole
a
oppose
to
where
the
requirement_9
lie
on

specific

however
maybe
you’re
look
for
an
arbitrage
strategy
in

would
be
more
ideal
which

maybe
it’s

maybe
there

what

you’ll

drastically
unreliable

often
it
can

often
sit
won’t

so
be
sure
to
ask
maybe
the
time
zone
connector_12
look
for
a

there
be
multiple
little
oddity
that
can
come
with
each
technology_1

often
this
can
be
part
of
their
charm
along
with
their
oddity
look
for
your
oddity
how
do
you
connector_13
your
connector_data_1
when
do
you
connector_13
your
connector_data_1
if
you’re
look
for
the
open
requirement_9
of
a
ticker

minute
after
the
requirement_1
be
open
maybe
you
want
to
think
about
connector_14
that
connector_data_1
a
little
early
there
be
so
much
to
say
about

your
connector_data_1
and
it’s
oddity
and
it’s
in
every
connector_data_1
set
this
give
a
much
deep
insight
into
make

you
where
to
go

what

about

component_2

if
you
have

you
probably
the

in

yahoo

and
yes
both
of
them
use
to
have
component_1
that
be
massively
popular
there
be
some
speculation
on
why
these
two
requirement_10
no
long
have
official
publicly
document
requirement_1
apis
and
here
be
my
hypothesis
&
yahoo
derive
much
of
their
revenue
from
digital
advertising
and
it
be
hard
if
not
impossible
to
serve

via
component_1
imagine
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
show
a
geico

via
a

dictionary
the
lack
of
alignment
between
the
advertising
requirement_7
component_13
and
the
component_2
requirement_7
component_13
eventually
lead
to
the
suspension

yahoo

still

there
be
still
a

however
financial
