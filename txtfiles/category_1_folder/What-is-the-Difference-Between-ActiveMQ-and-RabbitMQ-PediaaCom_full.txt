the
difference
between
technology_1
and
technology_2
be
that
technology_1
be
an
open
component_2
multi
technology_6
support
connector_data_1
pattern_1
connector_2
in
technology_7
technology_4
while
technology_2
be
an
open
component_2
multi
technology_6
support
connector_data_1
pattern_1
connector_2
in
technology_8
technology_4
a
connector_data_1
pattern_1
be
an
intermediate
component_3
component_4
that
help
to
convert
a
sender’s
connector_data_1
from
the
formal
connector_data_1
technology_6
to
the
receiver’s
formal
pattern_2
technology_6
furthermore
connector_data_1
pattern_1
help
in
component_3
and
telecommunication
requirement_2
to
allow
various
component_1
to
connector_3
with
each
other
by
exchange
define
connector_data_1
in
overall
technology_1
and
technology_2
be
two
common

technology_1
be
an
open_source
connector_data_1
pattern_1
in
logicblaze
initially
develop
technology_1
a
an
open_source
connector_data_1
pattern_1
in
technology_10
foundation
connector_4
the
technology_1
trademark
and
the
technology_1
consist
of
technology_7
connector_data_1
component_5
technology_11
component_6
it
be
capable
of
support
more
than
one
component_6
or
component_7
moreover
it
feature
component_3
cluster
help
it
to
manage
connector_5
also
there
be
two
version
of
technology_9
technology_1
“classic”
and
technology_1
artemis
technology_1
“classic”
be
a
pluggable
architecture
with
technology_12
full
component_6
implementation
include
technology_13
also
there
be
kahadb
and
technology_14
option
quality_attribute_1
for
persistence
moreover
there
be
a
requirement_2
of
pattern_1
for
a
quality_attribute_2
load
technology_1
artemis
be
a
high
requirement_4
pattern_3
architecture
for
pattern_4
pattern_2
component_8
it
contain
technology_12
and
with
full
component_6
implementation
include
technology_13
also
there
be
a
quality_attribute_3
cluster
for
quality_attribute_2
the
load
furthermore
there
be
a
powerful
technology_6
agnostic
connector_6
component_9
and
it
also
provide
easy
migration
technology_1
provide
multiple
advantage
it
support
various
technology_4
and
component_10
some
of
them
be
technology_15
technology_16
technology_17
and
net
moreover
it
be
possible
to
quality_attribute_4
multi
component_10
component_1
use
the
advance
connector_data_1
pattern_5
technology_6
technology_18
also
another
important
advantage
of
it
be
it
ability
to
exchange
connector_data_2
between
the
web
component_1
with
the
help
of
connector_7
text
orient
pattern_2
technology_6
stomp
over
web
connector_data_3
besides
it
also
help
in
manage
iot
component_11
in
overall
it
provide
support
to
any
pattern_2
requirement
what
be
technology_2
technology_2
be
an
open_source
connector_data_1
pattern_1
initially
it
be
design
to
connector_8
the
advance
connector_data_1
pattern_5
technology_6
late
it
be
extend
with
a
plugin
architecture
to
support
various
technology_6
such
a
stomp
and
technology_19
some
common
feature
of
technology_2
be
a
follow
pattern_6
pattern_2
–
there
be
support
for
multiple
pattern_2
technology_6
connector_data_1
pattern_5
and
connector_9
acknowledgement
developer
experience
–
allow
develop
cross
technology_4
pattern_2
with
various
technology_4
such
a
technology_7
technology_20
net
and
technology_17
additionally
the
developer
can
quality_attribute_5
the
component_1
with
technology_21
puppet
and
technology_22
quality_attribute_2
deployment
–
it
support
a
quality_attribute_2
environment
with
various
zone
and
region
moreover
quality_attribute_5
a
cluster
be
possible
for
high
quality_attribute_6
and
quality_attribute_7
requirement_5
and
requirement_6
support
–
there
be
pluggable
pattern_7
and
pattern_8
support
also
it
be
possible
to
quality_attribute_5
the
component_1
easily
to
and
private
requirement_6
technology_23
and
plugins
–
there
be
technology_23
for
contiguous
requirement_7
and
requirement_7
of
other
requirement_5
component_12
thus
they
help
to
extend
the
technology_2
requirement_3
requirement_8
and
pattern_9
–
moreover
there
be
technology_24
technology_25
command
line
technology_23
and
ui
for
manage
and
pattern_9
technology_2
difference
between
technology_1
and
technology_2
definition
technology_1
be
an
open_source
connector_data_1
pattern_1
connector_2
in
technology_7
and
consist
of
a
full
technology_7
connector_data_1
component_5
technology_11
component_6
on
the
other
hand
technology_2
be
an
open_source
connector_data_1
pattern_1
that
originally
connector_8
the
advance
connector_data_1
pattern_5
technology_6
so
this
be
the
fundamental
difference
between
technology_1
and
technology_2
developer
technology_10
foundation
be
the
developer
of
technology_1
while
pivotal
be
the
developer
of
technology_2
license
moreover
technology_1
have
the
technology_10
license
whereas
technology_2
have
the
mozilla
license
technology_4
above
all
the
difference
between
technology_1
and
technology_2
be
that
the
technology_1
be
connector_2
in
technology_7
while
the
technology_2
be
connector_2
in
technology_8
conclusion
in
brief
technology_1
and
rabitmq
be
two
widely
use
connector_data_1
pattern_1
the
difference
between
technology_1
and
technology_2
be
that
technology_1
be
an
open
component_2
multi
technology_6
support
connector_data_1
pattern_1
connector_2
in
technology_7
technology_4
while
technology_2
be
an
open
component_2
multi
technology_6
support
connector_data_1
pattern_1
connector_2
in
technology_8
technology_4
overall
they
both
support
industrial
technology_6
therefore
component_13
connector_4
benefit
in
a
broad
range
of
technology_4
and
component_10
