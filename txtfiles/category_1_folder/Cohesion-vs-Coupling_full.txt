pattern_3

component_6
be
create
this
seem
a
quality_attribute_2
organization
but
from
a
functional
perspective
there
s
tight
couple
across
folder
the
boundary

t
reflect
the
semantics
for
example
technology_1
requirement_1
would
involve
technology_1
component_5
productfactory
productrepository
and
productservice
across
all
folder
moreover
folder
have
logical
pattern_1
but
poor
functional
pattern_1
for
example
each
factory
deal
with
a
different
component_5
type
and
have
little
in
common
functionally
a
quality_attribute_2
way
to
organize
would
be
to
have
folder
order
technology_1
and
component_7
this
organization
be
base
on
purpose
and
requirement_2
this
be
quality_attribute_2
because
any
connector_5

technology_1
requirement_1
would
impact
only
co
locate
in
a

folder
be
more
readable
and
quality_attribute_3
team
would
be
more
independent
each
work
on

each
folder
could
also
be
versioned

release
independently

in
