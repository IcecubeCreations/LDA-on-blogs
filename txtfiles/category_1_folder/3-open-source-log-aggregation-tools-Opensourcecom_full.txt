i

often
i’ve
also
see
vendor
pitch
their
requirement_1

component_5
a
the

to

problem
requirement_1

be
a

it
isn’t

connector_data_1
a

of

feature
in

metric

component_5
be
the
regular
interval
and
the

component_5
customize
specifically
for
time
series
connector_data_1
the
regular
interval
allow
a
component_1
to
derive
real
mathematical
connector_data_3
consistently
if
a
requirement_1
aggregation
component_5
be
connector_3
metric
in
a
regular
interval
it
can
potentially
work
the
same
way
however
the
storage
component_5
isn’t
optimize
for
the
type
of
connector_4
that
be
typical
in
a
metric
aggregation
component_5
these
connector_4
will
take
more
resource
and
time
to
component_6
use
storage
component_4
find
in
requirement_1
aggregation
technology_1
so
we
a
requirement_1
aggregation
component_5
be
likely
not
suitable
for
time
series
connector_data_1
but
what
be
it
quality_attribute_1
for
a
requirement_1

component_5
be
a
great
place
for
connector_3
connector_data_1
these
be
irregular
activity
that
be
significant
an
example
might
be
connector_5
requirement_1
for
a
web
component_7
these
be
significant
because
we
want
to
what
be
connector_6
our
component_4
and
when
another
example
would
be
an
component_8

condition—because
it

the

an

option
however
it
can
come
with
significant
cost
requirement_1
represent

when
aggregate
across

or
thousand
of
component_9

component_8
the
ingestion

of

from

collection

around
technology_19
with
a
few
hundred
component_10
connector_data_3
in
200gb
of
requirement_1
connector_data_1
per
day
there’s
probably
room
for
improvement
in
that
component_5
but
even
reduce
it
by
half
will
cost
nearly
$10
per
month
in
many

offer
this
often
include
retention
of
only
day
which
isn’t
very
long
if
you
want
to
look
at
trend
connector_data_1
year
over
year
this
isn’t
to
discourage
the
use
of
these
component_5
a
they
can
be
very
valuable—especially
for
small
organization
the
purpose
be
to
point
out
that
there
could
be
significant
cost
and
it
can
be
discourage
when
they

the

introduce

be

collector
they
simplify
the

of

instead
of
need
to
understand
the
proper
syntax
of
each
type
of

a

can
install
a
beat
that
will
export

pattern_6
requirement_1
properly
so
they
can
be
use
effectively
within

when
instal
a
production
level
elk
technology_23
a
few
other
piece
might
be
include
technology_24
technology_25
and
technology_22
also
it
be
common
to
replace
logstash
with
fluentd
which
we’ll
discus
late
this
component_5
can
be
complex
to
operate
which
in
it
early
day
lead
to
a
lot
of
problem
and
complaint
these
have
largely
be
fix
but
it’s
still
a
complex
component_5
so
you
might
not
want
to
try
it
if
you’re
a
small
that
say
there
be
component_15
quality_attribute_2
so
you
don’t
have
to
worry
about
that
logz
io
will
run
it
for
you
but
it
connector_data_5
requirement_6
be
a
little
steep
if
you
have
a
lot
of
connector_data_1
of
you’re
probably
small
and
not
have
a
lot
of
connector_data_1
if
you
can’t
afford
logz
io
you
could
look
at
something
technology_26
elasticsearch
component_7
e
e
be
a
component_7
web
component_15
technology_27
offer
that
make
it
very
easy
to
connector_9
elasticsearch
work
quickly
it
also
have
technology_1
to
connector_9
all
technology_26
requirement_1
into
e
use
lambda
and
technology_28
this
be
a
much
cheap
option
but
there
be
some
requirement_7
require
and
there
be
a
few
limitation
elastic
the
parent
requirement_8
of
the
technology_23
offer
a
more
quality_attribute_3
technology_29
that
u
the
open
core
component_16
which
provide
additional
option
around
requirement_9
technology_1
and
report
it
can
also
be
component_11
on
requirement_2
component_17
or
technology_27
this
might
be
the
best
option
a
this
combination
of
technology_1
and
component_11
component_18
offer
a
cheap
solution
than
most
pattern_4
option
and
still
provide
a
lot
of
requirement_10
this
component_5
could
effectively
replace
or
give
you
the
capability
of
a
quality_attribute_4
connector_data_6
and
requirement_7
siem
component_5
the
elk
technology_23
also
offer
great
visualization
technology_1
through
kibana
but
it
lack
an
alerting
elastic
provide

requirement_11
within
the
pay
x
pack

but
there
be
nothing
build
in
for
the
open_source
component_5
yelp
have
create
a
solution
to
this
problem
connector_10
elastalert
and
there
be
probably
others
this
additional
piece
of
be
fairly
quality_attribute_3
but
it
increase
the
complexity
of
an
already
complex
component_5
graylog
graylog
have
recently
rise
in
popularity
but
it
connector_9
it
start
when
lennart
koopmann
create
it
back
in
a
requirement_8
be
bear
with
the
same
name
two
year
late
despite
it
increasing
use
it
still
lag
far
behind
the
elk
technology_23
this
also
mean
it
have
few
develop
feature
but
it
can
use
the
same
beat
that
the
elk
technology_23
u
graylog
have
gain
praise
in
the
go
with
the
introduction
of
the
graylog
collector
sidecar
connector_8
in
go
graylog
u
elasticsearch
technology_30
and
the
graylog
component_19
under
the
hood
this
make
it
a
complex
to
run
a
the
elk
technology_23
and
maybe
a
little
more
however
graylog
come
with
alerting
build
into
the
open_source
version
a
well
a
several
other
notable
feature
connector_11
connector_data_7
rewrite
and
geolocation
the
connector_12
feature
allow
for
connector_data_1
to
be
connector_13
to
specific
connector_14
in
real
time
while
they
be
be
component_6
with
this
feature
a
component_1
can
see
all
component_20
error
in
a
single
connector_11
and
web
component_19
error
in
a
different
connector_11
alert
can
even
be
base
on
these
connector_14
a
connector_data_8
be
or
when
a
threshold
be
exceed
quality_attribute_5
be
probably
one
of
the
big
issue
with
requirement_1
aggregation
component_5
and
connector_14
eliminate
that
issue
in
graylog
a
soon
a
the
requirement_1
come
in
it
can
be
connector_13
to
other
component_4
through
a
connector_11
without
be
component_6
fully
the
connector_data_7
rewrite
feature
u
the
open_source
rule
component_13
drool
this
allow
all
incoming
connector_data_4
to
be
evaluate
against
a
component_1
define
rule
enabling
a
connector_data_7
to
be
drop
connector_data_9
blacklist
a
to
be
or
remove
or
the
connector_data_7
to
be
modify
the
cool
feature
might
be
graylog’s
geolocation
capability
which
support
plot
ip
connector_15
on
a
connector_data_10
this
be
a
fairly
common
feature
and
be
quality_attribute_2
in
kibana
a
well
but
it
a
lot
of
value—especially
if
you
want
to
use
this
a
your
siem
component_5
the
geolocation
requirement_11
be
provide
in
the
open_source
version
of
the
component_5
graylog
the
requirement_8
charge
for
support
on
the
open_source
version
if
you
want
it
it
also
offer
an
open
core
component_16
for
it
requirement_12
version
that
offer
archive
audit
requirement_1
and
additional
support
there
aren’t
many
other
option
for
support
or
component_11
so
you’ll
likely
be
on
your
own
if
you
don’t
use
graylog
the
requirement_8
fluentd
fluentd
be
develop
at
treasure
connector_data_1
and
the
cncf
have
adopt
it
a
an
incubate
project
it
be
connector_8
in
technology_31
and
technology_32
and
be
recommend
by
technology_26
and
requirement_2
fluentd
have
become
a
common
replacement
for
logstash
in
many
installation
it
act
a
a
local
aggregator
to
connector_16
all
technology_19
requirement_1
and
connector_17
them
off
to
central
storage
component_5
it
be
not
a

aggregation
component_5
it
u
a
quality_attribute_3
plugin
component_5
to
provide
quick
and
easy
requirement_13
with
different
connector_data_1
component_21
and
connector_data_1
output
since
there
be
over
plugins
quality_attribute_2
most
of
your
use
requirement_14
should
be
cover
if
they
aren’t
this
sound
an
opportunity
to
contribute
back
to
the
open_source
fluentd
be
a
common
choice
in
technology_4
environment
due
to
it
low
memory
requirement
ten
of
megabyte
and
it
high
quality_attribute_6
in
an
environment
technology_4
where
each
pod
have
a
fluentd
sidecar
memory
consumption
will
increase
linearly
with
each
pod
create
use
fluentd
will
drastically
reduce
your
component_5
utilization
this
be
become
a
common
problem
with
technology_1
develop
in
technology_11
that
be
intend
to
run
one
per
