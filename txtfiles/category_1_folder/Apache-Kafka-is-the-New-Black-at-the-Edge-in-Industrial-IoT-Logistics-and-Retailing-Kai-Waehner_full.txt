or
should
i
quality_attribute_1
technology_2
in

or

i
be
glad
that
people
ask
because
it
be
a
valid
question
in
various
requirement_11
include
manufacture

requirement_11
aviation

multi

technology_2
have
become
the
norm
rather
than
an

a
technology_2
deployment
at

can
be
an
independent
project
however
in
most
requirement_12
technology_2
at
the

be
part
of
an
overall
technology_2
architecture
many
reason
exist
to
create
more

will
be
discus
in

there
i
will

connector_6
the
slide
and
a
video
component_1
in
another
after
the
conference
before
we
think
about
run
technology_2
at
the
edge
we
need
to
define
the
term
“edge”
what
be
“the
edge”
or
“edge
computing”
wikipedia
say
“edge
computing
be
a
quality_attribute_3
computing
paradigm
which
bring
computation
and
connector_data_1
storage
close
to
the
location
where
it
be
need
to
improve
connector_10
time
and
connector_11
bandwidth”
other
benefit
include
cost
reduction
quality_attribute_4
architecture
and
separation
of
concern
technology_1
technology_2
at
the
edge
different
option
exist
to
discus
“kafka
for
edge

only
component_8
at
the
edge
technology_2
component_8
run
at
the

technology_2
cluster
quality_attribute_1
in
a
connector_data_1

or
requirement_6
environment
everything

quality_attribute_1

edge
and
beyond

cluster
quality_attribute_1
at
the
edge
technology_2
component_8
e
g
smartphones
in
the
region
run
close
to
the
edge
therefore
the
range
of
“kafka
at
the
edge”
be
gigantic
edge
in
an
iiot
shop
floor
could
be
a
technology_2
component_9
connector_12
in
technology_16
and
quality_attribute_1
to
a
microcontroller
in
a
sensor
such
a
sensor
typically
have
a
few
kilobyte
of

it
life
for
a
define

span
before
it
die
and
connector_13
replace

in
telco
requirement_3
could
be
a
full
quality_attribute_3
technology_2

run
on
starlingx
this
be
an
open_source
private
requirement_6

technology_17
base
on

for

by
the
most

component_10
in

telecom
video
delivery
and
other
ultra
low
quality_attribute_5
use
requirement_12
the
hardware
requirement
for
such
an

be
high
than
what
some
team
in
a
traditional

requirement_13
connector_14
after
wait
six
month
for
requirement_9
approval
in
most
requirement_12
edge
be
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
two
extreme
scenario
describe
above
in
most
scenario
“kafka
at

mean
the
deployment
of
a
technology_2
cluster
on
at
the
edge
the
technology_2
component_8
be
either
run
on
or
close
to
the
“close”
could
be
several
mile
away
in
some
requirement_12
sometimes
the
edge
be
offline
and
disconnect
from
the
requirement_6
regularly
this
be
my
definition
for
this
too
make
sure
to
define
what
you
mean
with
the
term
“edge”
in
your
conversation
with
colleague
and
requirement_10
now
let’s
think
about
use
requirement_12
for
run
technology_2
at
the
edge
use
requirement_12
for
technology_2
at
the
edge
use
requirement_12
for

deployment
at
the

exist
in
various
requirement_11
no
matter
if
“your

be
smartphones

in
the

car
robot
cash
point
component_12
or
anything
else
let’s
take
a
look
at
a
few
example
of
what
i
have
see
in
in
many
different
requirement_14
industrial
iot
iiot
edge
requirement_8
and
component_6
in
real
time
be
key
for
success
in
modern

various
use
requirement_12
exist
for
requirement_11
include
predictive
quality_attribute_6
quality
insurance
component_6
optimization
and
cyber
quality_attribute_7
build
a
digital
twin
with
technology_2
be
one
of
the
most
frequent
scenario
and
a
perfect
fit
for
many
use
requirement_12
retail
the
digital
transformation
enable
many
innovative

include
requirement_10
experience
cross

and
collaboration
with

this
be
relevant
for
any
kind
of
retailer
no
matter
if
you
think
about

or
cut

the
go
component_13
logistics
correlation
of

so
on

no
matter
which
use
requirement_12
you
want
to
connector_17
the
architecture
for
technology_1
technology_2
at
the
edge
typically
look
more
or
le
the
follow
on
a
very
high
level
why
and
how
do
technology_2
help
at
the
edge
the
idea
and
use
requirement_12
discus
above
be
nothing
but
think
about
your
favorite
component_14
component_4
retailer
or
coffee
shop
how
many
requirement_14
have
already
roll
out
real
time
component_10
for
component_15
specific
connector_18
connector_data_2
requirement_15
or
other
component_16
at
quality_attribute_2
in
a
quality_attribute_8
way
honestly
not
many
only
some
tech
requirement_13
uber
and
lyft
do
a
great
though
these
requirement_13
could
start
on
the
green
a
few
year
ago
not
really
surprisingly
all
the
tech
requirement_13
use
the
connector_8
component_7
technology_2
a
the
heart
of
their
real
time
infrastructure
but
the
situation
connector_13
quality_attribute_9
and
quality_attribute_9
these
day
more
and
more
traditional
requirement_14
already
roll
out
an
connector_8
component_7
in
their
connector_data_1
center
or
in
the
requirement_6
to
component_6
connector_data_1
in
real
time
at
quality_attribute_2
to
build
innovative
component_4
challenge
at
the
edge
however
requirement_14
often
have
challenge
to
bring
these
innovative
real
time
component_10
into
scenario
where
connector_data_1
be
quality_attribute_3
in
local
sit
factory
retail
component_13
coffee
shop
etc
challenge
include
requirement_8
with
all
the
hardware
component_12
component_17
at
the
edge
be
hard
due
to
bad
requirement_5
and
many
other
limitation
component_6
at
quality_attribute_2
and
in
real
time
be
mandatory
for
many
use
requirement_12
thus
component_6
should
happen
on
not
in
a
remote
connector_data_1
center
or
requirement_6
often
hundred
of
mile
away
various
technology_14
and
technology_18
have
to
be
quality_attribute_10
at
the
edge
often
component_18
and
proprietary
technology_18
need
to
connector_19
with
modern
requirement_2
technology_19
on
the
other
side
of
the
tunnel
limit
hardware
resource
and
human
expertise
at
the
edge
it
expert
cannot
go
on
to
every
location
team
cannot
spend
a
lot
of
money
on
hardware
and
continuously
in
every
connector_data_1
have
to
be
component_13
and
component_6
locally
on
in
real
time
at
quality_attribute_2
plus
connector_data_1
need
to
be
replicate
to
the
connector_data_1
center
or
requirement_6
to
do
further
component_6
and
requirement_1
with
the
aggregate
connector_data_1
from
different
sit
in
best
requirement_12
connector_9
be
bidirectional
so
that
small
local
sit
can
be
control
from
one
single
point
by
connector_20
command
and
control
back
to
the
local
sit
the
same
infrastructure
and
technology_14
at
the
edge
and
in
the
connector_data_1
center
requirement_6
the
implementation
of
edge
use
requirement_12
be
a
lot
of
effort
roll
out
the
solution
to
all
the
sit
be
another
big
challenge
ideally
requirement_14
can
leverage
the
same
infrastructure
technology_14
and
component_10
both
on
at
the
edge
in
factory
or
connector_15
and
in
the
requirement_2
center
or
requirement_6
this
be
why
technology_1
technology_2
come
into
play
in
more
and
more
edge
scenario
leverage
the
same
infrastructure
technology_14
and
component_10
everywhere
real
time
connector_3
component_6
quality_attribute_11
and
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_12
be
core
feature
of
technology_2
this
allow
large
quality_attribute_2
scenario
in
the
requirement_6
and
small
or
quality_attribute_2
scenario
at
the
edge
let’s
take
a
loot
at
different
option
for
quality_attribute_1
technology_2
at
the
edge
technology_2
architecture
for
edge
computing
the
key
question
you
have
to
ask
yourself
do
i
need
high
quality_attribute_13
at
the
edge
edge
computing
do
not
always
require
high
quality_attribute_13
if
it
do
then
you
quality_attribute_1
a
traditional
technology_2
cluster
if
it
do
not
then
you
choose
the
quality_attribute_14
and
le
costly
option
with
one
single
technology_2
pattern_5
at
the
edge
a
hardware
appliance
could
make
this
even
easy
for
roll
out
in
ten
or
hundred
of
sit
the
follow
example
show
three
edge
sit
one
technology_2
cluster
be
quality_attribute_1
at
each
include
additional
technology_2
component_19
resilient
deployment
at
the
edge
with
3+
technology_2
pattern_5
technology_2
and
it
ecosystem
be
build
for
high
quality_attribute_13
and
zero
downtime
even
if
individual
technology_20
fail
usually
you
quality_attribute_1
a
quality_attribute_3
component_20
technology_2
and
technology_21
require
at
least
three
technology_20
other
component_21
require
at
least
two
technology_20
to
guarantee
quality_attribute_15
without
connector_data_1
loss
connector_21
out
the
technology_1
technology_2
and
confluent
component_7
reference
architecture
for
more
detail
about
deployment
best
practice
these
best
practice
do
not
connector_22
at
the
edge
have
say
this
the
load
and
quality_attribute_16
be
often
lower
at
the
edge
therefore
le
memory
and
small
disk
be
often
sufficient
it
all
quality_attribute_17
on
your
slas
requirement
and
use
requirement_12
non
resilient
deployment
at
the
edge
with
one
single
technology_2
pattern_5
the
demand
to
quality_attribute_1
a
“lightweight
technology_2
cluster”
at
the
edge
and
synchronize
replicate
connector_data_1
with
a
big
central
technology_2
cluster
come
up
more
and
more
due
to
hardware
limitation
or
lower
slas
regard
high
quality_attribute_13
the
deployment
of
one
single
technology_2
pattern_5
plus
one
technology_21
at
the
edge
be
totally
fine
you
can
even
quality_attribute_1
the
whole
technology_2
environment
on
one
single
component_5
this
create
some
obvious
drawback
no
pattern_6
downtime
in
requirement_12
of
failure
of
the
technology_20
or
requirement_5
risk
of
connector_data_1
loss
however
a
single
technology_20
technology_2
deployment
work
and
still
provide
many
benefit
of
the
technology_2
fundamental
decouple
between
component_22
and
component_23
handle
of
back
pressure
high
volume
real
time
component_6
even
one
pattern_5
have
a
lot
of
power
storage
on

ability
to
reprocess
connector_data_1
all
technology_2
requirement_7

for

tl
dr
a
single
pattern_5
technology_2

work
well
be
aware
of
the
drawback
and
doublecheck
if
this
be
okay
for
your
slas
and
requirement
technology_21
removal
–
a
great
help
for
technology_2
at
the
edge
technology_2
be
a
powerful
quality_attribute_3
infrastructure
hence
technology_2
be
not
the
easy
piece
of
infrastructure
to
operate
a
key
reason
be
the
connector_23
to
technology_21
the
same
be
true
for
many
other
quality_attribute_3
component_24
technology_4
or
technology_3
i
won’t
go
into
detail
about
the
challenge
and
problem
with
technology_21
here
there
be
enough
connector_data_3
on
the
web
tl
dr
technology_21
make
technology_2
hard
to
operate
and
le
quality_attribute_19
many
p1
and
p2
support
ticket
be
not
about
technology_2
but
about
technology_21
not
because
technology_21
be
unstable
but
because
it
be
hard
to
operate
the
quality_attribute_9
news
technology_2
will
connector_14
rid
of
technology_21
in
the
next
few
release
connector_21
out
“kip
replace
technology_21
with
a

quorum”
for
more
detail
kip
will
make
technology_2
much
more
lightweight
quality_attribute_19
elastic
and
quality_attribute_14
to
operate
this
be
relevant
both
at
extreme
quality_attribute_2
in
the
requirement_6
and
in
small
single
pattern_5
deployment
at
the
edge
a
most
iot
project
do
not
plan
one
year
ahead
but
be
roll
out
to
different
sit
over
five
and
more
year
remember
that
technology_2
will
be
much
easy
and
more
lightweight
without
technology_21
in
~1
year
from
now
technology_2
a
gateway
between
edge
component_17
and
requirement_6
a
technology_2
gateway
be
an
additional
optional
component_19
in
the
architecture
in
some
configuration
you
might
want
the
edge
component_17
to
connector_19
with
a
local
gateway
on

a
example
in
an
requirement_11
plant
you
might
see
multiple
component_11
or
production
line
a

component_25
they
quality_attribute_10
with
their
own
technology_2
cluster
and
connector_24
this
connector_data_1
to
a
gateway
technology_2
cluster
at
the
gateway
technology_2
cluster
you
can

it

the

self
build

–
when

why
to

you
should

ask

why
use

end

eclipse
ditto
be
a
great
open_source
technology_13
for
build
a
digital
twin
for
requirement_8
problem
i
think
differently
uptime
and
zero
connector_data_1
loss
require
this
be
a
long
discussion
but
tl
dr
most
requirement_8
project
have
critical
slas
the
infrastructure
have
to
run
without
downtime
and
without
connector_data_1
loss
the
more
technology_12
component_21
combine
the
hard
it
connector_13
to
ensure
your
slas
and
requirement
if
you
can
run
technology_2
infrastructure
for
each
additional
technology_12
component_21
you
combine
with
it
the
end
to
end
quality_attribute_13
go
down
additionally
you
have
to
develop

operate

pay
for
two
or
more
technology_12
component_21
instead
of
focus
on

under

i
see
the
requirement_16
of

technology_1
nifi

technology_20
red
you
have
a
drag&drop

this
be

if
you

lake
for

and
requirement_1
nifi
et
al
be

–
if
you
can
live
with
the
risk
of

technology_2

=
too

without

and
without

trust
me
you
will
have
a
lot
of
pain
i
have
see
many
deployment
where
end

requirement_8
combine

technology_12
technology_19
do
not
go
through
the
requirement_8
test
the
idea
look
nice
in
the
begin
but
be
not
quality_attribute_15
enough
for
mission
critical
scenario
think
about
it
again
the
more
technology_19
you
combine
with
each
other
the
high
the
risk
for
an
outage
or
connector_data_1
loss
nifi
a
one
example
run
it
own
quality_attribute_3

this
mean
you
have
to
guarantee

and
technology_2
to
the
final
component_14
technology_2
requirement_7

technology_2
connector_1
use
technology_2
topic
include
all
the
high
quality_attribute_13
feature
of

under

this
mean
you
have
to
operate
one

in

to
guarantee
end

requirement_8
without

again
this
be
fine
for

i
see
the

not
the
right
way
to
build

the

you
can
use
the

i
think
it
be
not

it
be

the

be
also
verify

it
provide
connector_26
to

not
