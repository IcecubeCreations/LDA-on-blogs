no

for
a
couple
of
month
now
i
have
be
work
on
an
component_3
that
us
technology_1
technology_2
i
be
not
sure
if
it’s
a
quality_attribute_2
choice
for
this
component_3
because
it
do
not
deal
with
many
component_4
of
connector_data_1
but
i
be
convinced
that
technology_1
technology_2
can
provide
easy
to
connector_1
requirement_1
and
it’s
a
quality_attribute_2
choice
for
some
component_1
in
a
pattern_1
architecture
the
technology_1
technology_2
project
be
already
run
for
some
time
and
i
wonder
be
it
ready
for
the
future
first
i
will
explain
a
bit
what
i
think
technology_1
technology_2
be
and
why
it
be
useful
i
will
also
give
some
example
what
be
technology_1
technology_2
technology_1
technology_2
be
a
technology_4
full
of
technology_5
for
connector_2
connector_data_2
within
an
component_3
it
be
a
technology_4
you
use
when
a
full
blow
requirement_2
component_5
bus
be
not
yet
need
it
focus
on
connector_3
different
kind
of
connector_data_3
from
different
kind
of
component_4
to
their
destination
use
technology_1
technology_2
intensively
in
an
component_3
mean
it
become
connector_data_4
base
it
provide
an
implementation
of
the
requirement_2
requirement_1
pattern_2
which
be
describe
in
the
book
‘enterprise
requirement_1
pattern_2
design
build
and
quality_attribute_3
pattern_3
solutions’
use
a
domain
specific
technology_6
technology_1
camel’s
coding_keyword_2
build
block
be
a
‘route’
which
contain
flow
and
requirement_1
component_6
in
the
connector_4
you
can
specify
the
component_4
and
use
the
dsl
you
can
also
define
which
transformation
need
to
be
do
during
the
trip
from
component_7
to

in
your
connector_4
you
can
define
uris
to
connector_5
connector_data_2
provide
by
different
component_7
transport
technology_7
or
pattern_3
component_8
and
also
connector_6
connector_data_2
to
them
for
example
technology_8
technology_9
amazon’s
sqs
technology_10
technology_11
and
many
more
also
component_9
can
be

but
cannot
be
define
a
a
component_7
technology_1
technology_2
in
general
work
nicely
together
with
technology_3
a
technology_2
technology_3
autoconfiguration
and
starter
be
quality_attribute_4
why
use
technology_1
technology_2
it
be
quite
difficult
to
explain
why
one
would
need
technology_1
technology_2
but
i
will
try
i
think
technology_1
technology_2
be
a
great
technology_5
when
your
component_3
connector_7
connector_data_2
from
many
different
component_7
at
a
certain
moment
when

more
component_7
the
be
connector_3
litter
with
various
component_2
technology_12
and
custom
that
do
connector_data_4
transformation
which
be
when
it
be
maybe
time
to
look
into
technology_1
technology_2
the
dsl
provide
a
clear
way
to
define
the
requirement_1
and
transformation
require
for
the
connector_data_2
from
these
component_7
besides
you
can
easily
set
up
in
memory
component_10
to
prevent
overload
of
certain
connector_data_5
in
the
component_3
use
for
example
the
seda
component_11
seda
create
a
pool
of
component_12
to
component_13
incoming
connector_data_4
also
direct
vm
and
vm
component_14
be
provide
to
connector_6
connector_data_3
to
component_15
run
on
the
same
technology_13
virtual
component_16
in
the
dsl
you
have
the
‘choice’
construct
that
enable
conditional
connector_8
this
mean
you
can
determine
if
a
connector_data_4
for
example
need
to
be
connector_9
to
a
specific

the
technology_4
also
provide
one
set
of
concept
and
component_8
to
argue
about
requirement_1
issue
the
same
concept
of
and
component_17
can
be
use
when
connector_3
connector_data_2
from
an
technology_11
topic
or
when
be
drop
in
a
directory
or
when
component_13
a
pattern_4
connector_data_6
while
technology_1
technology_2
be
expressive
and
declarative
it
do
complexity
a
technology_6
be
introduce
in
the
codebase
that
a
lot
of
developer
be
not
familiar
with
some
examplesa
quality_attribute_5

in

the

there

when
finish
the
be
move
to

the
connector_4

define
when
a
connector_4
be
active
and
the
unmarshal
define
how
the
content
be
transform
to
a
technology_14
a
component_18
the
component_13
connector_data_7
enable
you
to
connector_10
the
connector_data_4
in
form
of
an
‘exchange’
connector_data_8
in
a
processor
where
you
can
connector_1
it
and
connector_11
it
at
the
end
the
connector_data_4
be
connector_9
to
a
‘process’
of
the
component_18
with
the
name
‘outputbean’
the
two
argument
of
the

provide
use
the
‘simple

language’
which
be
part
of
technology_2
the
body
be
the
coding_keyword_2
connector_data_4
content
and
the
coding_keyword_3
provide
metadata
which
often
be
automatically
provide
by

the
connector_4
test
split
incoming
connector_data_3
in
a
connector_data_4
for
each

character
the
‘direct’
technology_15
use
in
this
example
be
useful
for
pattern_5
connector_12
between
connector_8
an
important
point
be
to
the
advicewith
which
connector_13
the
output
to
mock
connector_data_9
uri
the
technology_15
‘mock’
in
the
uri
be
require
when
mock
the
@dirtiescontext
be
need
for
the
clean
up
of
the
component_3
component_19
after
a
test
technology_2
connector_8
be
not
always
easy
to
test
in
my
opinion
but
there
be
support
provide
for
junit
the
‘cameltestsupport’
which
provide
a
‘camelcontext’
and
a
‘producertemplate’
the
‘producertemplate’
be
use
to
provide
connector_data_3
and
these
can
be
use
a
input
for
a
connector_4
mock
be
also
provide
and
there
be
the
camelspringrunner
for
requirement_1
test
use
in
the
example
the
futureapache
technology_2
could
be
very
useful
in
a
component_20
with
pattern_1
in
this
requirement_4
you
have
many
component_1
work
together
and
technology_2
can
play
a
role
in
requirement_1
for
example
when
create
a
component_21
gateway
describe
in
this

technology_8
developer
redhat
technology_16




pattern_1
compare
diy
with
technology_1
technology_2
the
example
in
the
connector_14
really
show
that
it’s
possible
to
create
an
elegant
solution
to
do
multiple
connector_data_5
to
different
component_1
and
combine
the
connector_data_9
it
also
show
that
technology_1
technology_2
provide
support
for
circuit
break
hystrix
another
nice
addition
be
a
component_11
for
connector_15
with
a
pattern_6
technology_17
technology_18
for
the
future
of
technology_1
technology_2
i
think
it
would
be
benefical
to
have
more
component_14
for
connector_12
with
requirement_5
component_22
for
technology_19
component_22
some
component_14
be
quality_attribute_4
but
for
technology_20
and
the
requirement_5
component_23
not
so
much
developer
be
still
quite
actively
connector_16
in
the
technology_1
technology_2
project
so
i
expect
more
component_14
will
become
quality_attribute_4
an
alternative
to
technology_1
technology_2
be
for
example
technology_3
requirement_1
which
have
similar
feature
but
people
tend
to
favor
the
syntax
of
technology_1
technology_2
another
alternative
be
technology_21
esb
but
this
be
a
more
ready
to
use
component_23
than
a
technology_4
technology_1
technology_2
look
a
solid
technology_4
with
a
nice
fluent
technology_22
it
provide
support
for
a
lot
of
connector_data_2
component_7
i
would
suggest
use
it
in
a
component_22
that
be
connector_15
and
connector_17
connector_data_2
from
to
a
lot
of
different
component_7
for
example
an
component_21
gateway
or
an
aggregator
component_22
