quality_attribute_1
for

typically
component_2
can
be
quality_attribute_3
by
use
a
connector_data_1
component_1
which
be
a
way
for
component_2
to
connector_1
connector_data_2
between
one
another
quality_attribute_4
by
leverage
slack
a
a
connector_data_1
component_1
discover
how
you
can
design
or
even
technology_1
your
slack
requirement_1
to
become
highly
quality_attribute_5
and
quality_attribute_6
out
of
the
component_3
for
requirement_2
base
requirement_1
serverless
infrastructure
can
be
use
to
attain
high
quality_attribute_2
however
requirement_1
that
require
great
local
control
and
visibility
commonly
lack
a
quality_attribute_7
component_4
design
these
type
of
requirement_1
could
use
an
active
passive
configuration
to
achieve
high
quality_attribute_2
where
one
requirement_1
be
live
i
e
active
and
another
requirement_1
be
on
standby
i
e
passive
ready
to
take
over
for
an
active
active
configuration
i
e
many
live
requirement_1
quality_attribute_7
component_2
commonly
use
a
connector_data_1
orient
technology_2
to
connector_2
and
component_5
asynchronously
the
primary
disadvantage
of
both
type
be
that
they
require
an
extra
component_6
in
the
architecture
in
this

i’ll
connector_3
how
i
leverage
slack
a
a
connector_data_1
component_1
to
enable
an
active
active
high
quality_attribute_2
configuration
without

extra
infrastructure
and
connector_3
a
few
use
requirement_3
that
take
advantage
of
a
slackmq
the
few
move

no

christian

minimalist
architecture
with
some
creativity
slack
can
do
the
heavy
lift
of
a
quality_attribute_9
connector_data_1
component_1
when
a
connector_data_1
be
connector_4
it
be
“locked”
while
be
component_5
this
keep
other
component_8
requirement_1
from
component_5
the
connector_data_1
simultaneously
i
use
a
slack
requirement_1
to
automate
the
home
a
“toggle

connector_data_1
to
a
slack
pattern_1
would
be
connector_5
by
a
requirement_1
and
action
for
pattern_2
i
have
the

instal

insert

avoid

and
be
an
unsatisfactory
workaround
the
slack
component_10
allow
pin
to
be

once
per

per

also
reaction
and
star
can
be

to
a

once
per

for
example
a
person
or
requirement_1
cannot
pin
a
connector_data_1
that
have
already
be
pin
a

or
requirement_1
cannot

the

also
allow

this
limit
the

the
