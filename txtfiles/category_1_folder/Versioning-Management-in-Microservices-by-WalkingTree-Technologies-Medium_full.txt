general
pattern_1
be
mean
and
design
to
be
connector_1
by
multiple
independent
or
interdependent
component_1
with
current
technology_2
development
methodology
agile
in
place
these
pattern_1
will
continue
to
quality_attribute_1
rapidly
but
practically
not
all
component_2
will
be
quality_attribute_1
at
the
same
rate
this
lead
to
a
situation
where
a
give
pattern_2
should
be
able
to
exhibit
multiple
behavior
at
any
give
instance
to
support
different
component_3
need
this
be
where
the
need
for
some
kind
of
version
requirement_1
come
into
the
picture
in
this
i
will
be
cover
general
perception
i
observe
around
versioning
different
way
of
connector_2
versioning
and
best
practice
for
versioning

requirement_1
systemhey
buddy
how
be
you
happy
to
see
you
hi
veteran
i
be
quality_attribute_3
nice
to
meet
you
you
acknowledge
that
i
be
a
veteran
i
have
be
solve
problem
for
a
long
time
i
you
be
and
difficult
to
adopt
you
ask
the
team
to
keep
the
separate
for
every
connector_3
i
handle
all
with
a
single
base
i
you
be
connector_4
old
you
ask
the
team
to
connector_5
shitty
with
multiple
if
else
condition
everywhere
most
of
the
become
obsolete
over
a
period
of
time
yes
i
ask
for
separate
base
but
the
be
clean
you
ask
the
team
to
fire
up
multiple
set
of
vms
to
support
different
version
which
be
very
costly
and
time
connector_1
effort
in
my
requirement_2
one
set
of
vms
be
enough
i
understand
i
be
cost
for
vms
but
i
connector_6
a
quality_attribute_3
amount
of
quality_attribute_4
effort
developer
will
have
a
quick
turnaround
with
my
i
think
you
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
these
day
computation
cost
be
lot
cheap
compare
to
development
cost
you
be
constantly
tell
that
with
my
approach
we
be
quality_attribute_4
effort
can
you
detail
it
out
sure
thank
you
for
ask
when
component_4
be
modify
to
support
backward
quality_attribute_2
you
come
up
with
if
this
parameter
be
pass
then
do
this
way
if
not
then
do
another
way
this
you
will
have
in
many
place
sometimes
you
will
have
private
which
will
be
invoke
only
when
a
specific
condition
be
true
and
this
condition
be
not
for
requirement_3
use
requirement_2
but
primarily
to
support
backward
quality_attribute_2
with
this
the
be
the
mix
of
requirement_3
condition
and
backward
quality_attribute_5
condition
which
be
difficult
for
a
developer
to
understand
and
modify
i
see
but
with
your
approach
you
end
up
make
requirement_4
complex
component_5
need
to
keep
a
track
of
what
version
they
be
go
to
invoke
i
see
this
a
a
clean
way
of
do
component_6
will
maintain
the
version
of
pattern_2
they
invoke
and
upgrade
the
version
a
part
of
component_6
upgradation
to
invoke
a
version
of
component_4
in
your
approach
you
end
up
run
vms
specific
to
old
version
forever
this
be
not
true
with
audit
in
place
we
can
track
how
many
connector_data_1
be
come
for
give
component_4
instance
belong
to
a
certain
version
for
a
continuous
period
if
there
be
no
connector_data_1
then
you
can
safely
retire
instance
retire
instance
be
a
lot
cheap
and
easy
compare
to
retire
obsolete
be
it
not
so
complex
to
keep
track
of
who
be
connector_7
what
version
of
component_4
we
can
have
the
version
of
give
component_4
a
one
of
the
technology_2
requirement_5
output
with
requirement_5
pool
and
unique
transaction
combination
we
should
able
to
track
who
be
invoke
what
version
of
a
give
component_4
i
be
the
darling
of
many
component_7
that
be
build
so
far
i
be
embed
into
technology_3
development
component_8
without
backward
quality_attribute_2
connector_8
release
won’t
be
approve
i
agree
that
be
the
requirement_2
you
do
a
fantastic
for
monolithic
component_9
but
now
we
be
in
the
age
of
pattern_1
we
need
a
age
solution
for
age
challenge
thank
you
i
hope
people
will
remember
my
contribution
definitely
you
do
a
great
so
far
people
will
remember
you
a
long
a
monolithic
component_10
exist
i
need
to
go
a
lot
of
people
be
wait
for
me
thank
you
very
much
for
your
time
ok
bye

general
versioning
techniquesirrespective
of
the
architecture
pattern_3
i
e
whether
pattern_1
or
monolith
there
be
two
technology_2
version
technique
which
be
popular
in
the
we
will
briefly
cover
what
be
they
and
when
to
use
what
semantic
versioningwhat
be
it
semantic
versioning
represent
each
release
with
the
combination
of
three
non
negative
major
minor
patch
and
each
imply
certain
mean
major
increase
this
number
when
the
previous
version
be
incompatible
with
the
version
minor
increase
this
number
when
the
previous
version
be
quality_attribute_5
with
the
version
but
internal
requirement_3
component_11
be
connector_3
patch
increase
this
number
when
the
previous
version
be
quality_attribute_5
with
the
version
but
a
bug
be
fix
a
part
of
the
version
the
increment
in
the
either
of
the
three
automatically
imply
certain
specific
mean
for
the
component_3
when
to
use
when
you
be
work
on
a
project
with
many
and
each
be
interdependent
on
another
then
semantic
versioning
will
definitely
be
a
savior

semver

versioningwhat
be
it
calendar
versioning
be
another
type
of
semantic
versioning
but
instead
of
use
non
negative
it
be
primarily
drive
by
calendar
date
i
e
the
combination
of
year
month
and
date
rather
the
fix
the
specific

combination
for
versioning
specific
to
your
component_9
when
to
use
when
the
component_9
be
time
bind
this
versioning
be
very
much
useful
there
be
some
lead
operate
component_7
who
tie
their
support
cycle
base
on
the
calendar
version
for
major
version
they
provide
a
couple
of
year
of
support
and
for
minor
version
couple
of
month
support
and
their
support
period
be
directly
derive
from
the
correspond
version
ubuntu
be
an
example
of
this
more
detail
you
can
find
detail
about
calendar
versioning
at
technology_4
calver
for
requirement_6
requirement_3
component_9
who
u
pattern_1
i
would
recommend
the
semantic
versioning
approach
calendar
versioning
be
more
suitable
for
the
technology_3
where
support
and
quality_attribute_6
period
be
duration
drive
rather
than
usage
drive
pattern_1
versioning
approachesspecific
to
pattern_1
we
can
use
either
of
the
follow
approach
for
versioning
url
base
versioningthis
approach
be
primarily
about
the
version
number
to
the
component_4
url
a
version
number
be
part
of
the
url
itself
it
be
easy
to
identify
the
specific
version
that
be
be
invoke
without
connector_4
into
detail
at
the
component_12
level
if
you
want
to
redirect
component_4
connector_data_1
with
no
version
mention
to
default
version
then
this
type
of
versioning
be
quick
and
quality_attribute_7
drive
versioningin
this
approach
version
be
maintain
at
the
of
the
connector_data_3
technology_4
technology_6
have
content
version
a
one
of
the
attribute
and
in
this
approach
this
attribute
be
use
to
hold
the
version
number
for
a
give
component_4
academically
this
approach
be
recommend
for
versioning
a
the
resource
and
it
version
be
represent
a
per
the
pattern_4
specification
configure
load
balancer
to
support
multiple
version
of
the
same
component_4
will
be
relatively
complex
and
runtime
also
load
balancer
take
more
time
a
it
have
to
inspect
for
each
component_4
connector_data_3
to
connector_9
to
the
correct
version
recommend
best
practicesservice
versioning
and
documentation
must
work
hand
in
hand
make
component_13
documentation
mandatory
for
each
version
to
reap
the
best
possible
benefit
of
the
versioning
if
documentation
be
not
maintain
then
integrator
will
connector_10
confuse
and
end
up
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
unproductive
connector_data_4
at
the
component_6
level
a
component_11
of
append
the
version
number
to
a
component_4
must
be
in
common
rather
than
for
each
component_4
at
the
component_6
level
make
component_4
url
and
version
number
quality_attribute_8
so
that
developer
will
focus
only
on
requirement_3
level
requirement_4
at
the
component_12
level
make
sure
version
number
of
component_4
be
part
of
technology_2
requirement_5
output
create
a
delivery
pipeline
so
that
possible
version
mismatch
be
verify
and
fix
at
an
early
stage
of
connector_3
and
quality_attribute_5

connector_data_1
