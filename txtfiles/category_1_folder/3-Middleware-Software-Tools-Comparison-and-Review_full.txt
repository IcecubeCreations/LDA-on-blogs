a
the
name
suggest
technology_1
be
a
pattern_2
that
sit
in
the
middle
between
separate
component_2
–
provide
an
that
“glues”
these
component_3
together
the
word
“middleware”
be
a
catch
all
term
that
describe
many
of
the
component_2
most
commonly
in
use
today
such
a
web
and
component_4
component_5
component_6
connector_1
component_1
and
content
requirement_2
component_7
technology_1
be
a
form
of
infrastructure
that
enable
complex
requirement_3
component_2
to
take
shape
often
the
original
part
of
such
an
component_4
be
not
intend
to
connector_2
with
each
other
require
specially
design
technology_1
to
bridge
the
gap
between
them
each
component_8
of
a
complex
component_4
be
develop
use
different
programming
technology_4
technology_5
and
component_9
therefore
technology_1
provide
component_1
such
a
connector_data_1
pattern_3
and
component_10
that
allow
these
component_11
to
“talk”
to
each
other
and
connector_3
at
the
same
time
component_2
use
technology_1
for
a
variety
of
reason
technology_1
can
be
use
to
“smooth
over”
the
appearance
of
the
component_4
and
hide
it
quality_attribute_1
nature
eliminate
any
difference
in
term
of
operate
component_7
hardware
or
technology_5
use
technology_1
also
make
it
easy
for
developer
to
have
a
uniform
to
work
with
so
different
component_11
of
the
component_4
can
be
quality_attribute_2
and
port
to
other
location
in
recent
year
the
requirement_4
have
see
a
shift
to
open
component_12
technology_1
a
more
mature
quality_attribute_3
solution
have
emerge
open
component_12
technology_1
have
much
to
recommend
it
component_13
be
free
to
modify
the
component_12
for
their
own
need
and
purpose
and
you
have
full
visibility
and
quality_attribute_4
into
the
solution
so
you
your
component_2
be
quality_attribute_5
here’s
a
look
at
three
of
the
most
popular
choice
for
requirement_5
technology_1
technology_6
eap
technology_7
and
technology_8
technology_9

technology_6
requirement_5
component_4
component_9
eap
technology_6
requirement_5
component_4
component_9
eap
be
a
mouthful
of
a
name
and
it
pack
a
powerful
punch
a
well
version

of
the
be
release
last
year
provide
a
requirement_6
quality_attribute_6
quality_attribute_7
solution
for
requirement_5
look
to
increase
their
agility
benefit
of
technology_6
eap
solid
architectural
foundation
with
quick
start
up
time
and
low
memory
usage
out
of
the
component_14
requirement_7
with
devops
technology_2
such
a
technology_10
technology_11
and
arquillian
“jboss
migration
center”
at
technology_12

make
it
quality_attribute_8
to
move
your
exist
component_2
high
quality
support
consistently
outperform
the
other
two
solution
in
requirement_1
survey
technology_6
eap
requirement_8
and
support
a
technology_13
one
year
subscription
to
technology_6
eap
run
on

cpu
core
will
cost
your
organization
$8

which
include
web
and
phone
support
during
technology_13
requirement_3
hour
if
you
need
premium
support
which
include


assistance
for
problem
of
urgent
and
high
level
importance
you’ll
be

$12

annually

technology_7
promote

technology_7
component_4
component_5
a
a
high
requirement_9
feature
rich
option
–
the
ferrari
to
red_hat’s
ford
focus
if
you
will
but
be
the
advantage
worth
the
high
requirement_8
tag
benefit
of
technology_7
rapid
installation
deployment
and
development
support
for
on
premise
requirement_6
base
and
hybrid
solution
requirement_7
with
other
technology_14
in
the
requirement_6
such
a
the
watson
requirement_10
and
the
dashdb
technology_15
component_6
component_15
quality_attribute_7
quality_attribute_9
architecture
that
can
quality_attribute_10
to
match
demand
technology_7
requirement_8
and
support
technology_7
component_4
component_5
be
free
of
charge
without
support
and
with
a
maximum
heap
size
of

gigabyte
for
the
technology_16
virtual
component_16
after
that
the
cost
to
run
technology_7
be
base
on
pvus
processor
requirement_11
unit
which
vary
base
on
the
type
of
processor
you’re
use
a
of
connector_4
the
annual
cost
of
a
subscription
and
support
plan
be
$55

per
pvu
or
$14

per
limit
use
connector_data_2

technology_8
technology_9
last
but
certainly
not
least
technology_8
technology_9
be
the
third
contender
when
it
come
to
requirement_5
option
for
technology_1
–
with
much
to
recommend
it
benefit
of
technology_8
technology_9
oracle’s
requirement_5
grid
pattern_4
be
a
high
requirement_9
architecture
for
connector_5
between
component_2
hassle
free
component_4
deployment
connector_data_3
in
lower
operational
cost
technology_8
jrockit
at
the
hood
of
technology_9
claim
to
be
the
“fastest
technology_17
in
the
industry”
easy
requirement_7
with
other
technology_8
component_2
and
component_6
technology_8
technology_9
requirement_8
and
support
technology_8
allow
requirement_5
component_13
to
license
technology_9
via
either
the
number
of
component_13
or
the
number
of
processor
an
annual
subscription
will
cost
$5

per
processor
or
$100
per
component_17
a
well
a
a
license
and
support
fee
equal
to
$5

or
$110
respectively
multi
year
and
perpetual
license
be
also
quality_attribute_11
for
purchase
final
thought
all
three
of
these
technology_1
solution
be
strong
option
so
the
choice
ultimately
come
down
to
your
circumstance
if
you
rely
on
other
technology_14
in
the
or
technology_8
ecosystem
for
example
then
it
make
sense
to
use
their
technology_1
offer
a
well
in
the
end
it’s
worth
the
effort
to
speak
with
sale
rep
about
your
organization’s
particular
situation
so
