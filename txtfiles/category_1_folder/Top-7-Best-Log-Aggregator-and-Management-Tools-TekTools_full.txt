solution
offer
comprehensive
requirement_1
requirement_2
and
requirement_10
feature
though
it
support
requirement_1
aggregation
the
tool’s
primary
highlight
be
it
requirement_10
it
can
easily
analyze
massive
requirement_1
volume
in
complex
hybrid

technology_4
you
can
also
define

technology_1
in
our
study
of
requirement_1
aggregator
many
of
the
open
component_12
technology_1
offer
a
high
level
of
quality_attribute_9
but
require

requirement_10
might
be
a
