of
content
this
chapter
mark
a
turn
point
in
our
adventure
with
apis
we
be
finish
cover
fundamental
and
be
now
ready
to
see
how
the
previous
concept
combine
to
form
an
technology_5
in
this
chapter
we
discus
the
component_6
of
an
component_1
by
design
one
organize
connector_data_1
national
geographic
estimate
that
in

american
snap

billion
photo

with
so
many
photo
you
can
imagine
the
different
approach
people
have
to
organize
them
on
their
component_7
some
people
prefer
to
connector_data_2
everything
into
a
single
folder
others
meticulously
arrange
their
picture
into
a
hierarchy
of
folder
by
year
month
and

requirement_1
give
similar
think
to
organization
when
build
their
apis
a
we
mention
in
chapter

the
purpose
of
an
component_1
be
to
make
it
easy
for
component_8
to
work
with
the
requirement_1
s
connector_data_1
with
ease
of
use

decide
to
have
a

the
connector_data_1
and
make
it

the
best
way
to
connector_data_3
it
component_1
for
it
particular
situation
guide
by
exist
requirement_2
best
practice
start
with
an
architectural
style
when
discuss
apis
you
might
hear
talk
of
technology_6
and
rest
and
wonder
whether
the
developer
be
do
work
or
plan
a
vacation
the
truth
be
that
these
be
the
name
of
the
two
most
common
architecture
for
web
base
apis
technology_7
formerly
an
acronym

be
an
technology_8
base
design
that
have
standardize
connector_data_4
for
connector_data_5
and
connector_5
rest
which
stand
for
representational
state
transfer
be
a
more
open
approach
provide
lot
of
convention
but
leave
many
decision
to
the
person
design
the
technology_5
throughout
this

you
have
notice
we
ve
have
an
inclination
for
pattern_2
apis
the
preference
be
largely
due
to
rest
s
incredible
rate
of
adoption

this
be
not
to
say
that
technology_7
be
evil
it
have
it
strong
point

however
the
focus
of
our
discussion
will
stay
on
pattern_2
a
this
will
likely
be
the
kind
of
component_1
you
encounter
in
the
remain
section
we
walk
through
the
component_6
that
make
up
a
pattern_2
technology_5
our
first
resource
back
in
chapter

we
talk
a
little
bit
about
resource
recall
that
resource
be
the
noun
of
component_2
requirement_3
and
pizza
these
be
the
thing
we
want
the
world
to
be
able
to
connector_6
with
through
our
technology_5
to
connector_2
a
feel
for
how
a
requirement_1
would
design
an
technology_5
coding_keyword_1
s
try
our
hand
at
it
with
our
pizza
parlor
we
ll
start
by

the
ability
to
order
a
pizza
for
the
component_9
to
be
able
to
talk
pizza
with
u
we
need
to
do
several
thing
decide
what
resource
s
need
to
be
quality_attribute_2
assign
url
to
those
resource
decide
what
action
the
component_9
should
be
allow
to
perform
on
those
resource
figure
out
what
piece
of
connector_data_1
be
require
for
each
action
and
what
technology_4
they
should
be
in
pick
resource
can
be
a
difficult
first
connector_data_6
one
way
to
approach
the
problem
be
to
step
through
what
a
typical
connector_7
involve
for
our
pizza
parlor
we
probably
have
a
coding_keyword_2
on
that
coding_keyword_2
be
pizza
when
a
requirement_3
want
u
to
make
one
of
the
pizza
for
them
they
place
an
order
in
this
component_10
coding_keyword_2
pizza
requirement_3
and
order
all
sound
quality_attribute_1
candidate
for
resource
coding_keyword_1
s
start
with
order
the
next
step
be
assign
url
to
the
resource
there
be
lot
of
possibility
but
luckily
pattern_2
convention
give
some
guidance
in
a
typical
pattern_2
technology_5
a
resource
will
have
two
url
pattern_3
assign
to
it
the
first
be
the
plural
of
the
resource
name
order
the
second
be
the
plural
of
the
resource
name
plus
a
unique
identifier
to
specify
a
single
resource
order
order_id
where
order_id
be
the
unique
identifier
for
an
order
these
two
url
pattern_3
make
up
the
first
that
our
component_1
will
support
these
be
connector_8
simply
because
they
go
at
the
end
of
the
url
a
in
technology_9
example
technology_10
endpoint_goes_here
now
that
we
pick
our
resource
and
assign
it
url
we
need
to
decide
what
action
the
component_9
can
perform
follow
pattern_2
convention
we
say
that
the
plural
order
be
for
connector_data_7
exist
order
and
create
one
the
plural
with
a
unique
identifier
order
order_id
be
for
connector_9
update
or
cancel
a
specific
order
the
component_9
tell
the
component_11
which
action
to
perform
by
pass
the
appropriate
technology_9
verb
connector_2
coding_keyword_3
put
or
delete
in
the
connector_data_8
altogether
our
component_1
now
look
this
technology_9
verb
action
connector_2
order
connector_data_7
exist
order
coding_keyword_3
order
place
a
order
connector_2
order

connector_2
detail
for
order
#1
connector_2
order

connector_2
detail
for
order
#2
put
order

update
order
#1
delete
order

cancel
order
#1
with
the
action
for
our
order
flesh
out
the
final
step
be
to
decide
what
connector_data_1
need
to
be
exchange
between
the
component_9
and
the
component_11
borrowing
from
our
pizza
parlor
example
in
chapter

we
can
say
that
an
order
need
a
crust
and
topping
we
also
need
to
select
a
connector_data_1
technology_4
that
the
component_9
and
component_11
can
use
to
pass
this
connector_data_9
back
and
forth
connector_data_10
and
technology_11
be
both
quality_attribute_1
choice
but
for
readability
sake
we
ll
go
with
technology_12
at
this
point
you
should
pat
yourself
on
the
back
we
have
design
a
functional
technology_5
here
be
what
an
connector_7
between
the
component_9
and
component_11
might
look
use
this
technology_5
figure

example
connector_7
between
the
component_9
and
component_11
use
our
technology_5
connector_10
resource
together
our
pizza
parlor
component_1
be
look
sharp
order
be
come
in
never
before
requirement_4
be
so
quality_attribute_1
in
fact
we
decide
we
want
to
start
track
order
by
requirement_3
to
gauge
loyalty
an
easy
way
to
do
this
be
to
a
requirement_3
resource
with
order
our
requirement_3
resource
need
some

follow
convention
requirement_3
and
requirement_3
coding_keyword_4
fit
nicely
we
ll
skip
the
detail
but
coding_keyword_1
s
say
we
decide
which
action
make
sense
for
each
and
what
connector_data_1
represent
a
requirement_3
assume
we
do
all
of
that
we
come
to
an
interest
question
how
do
we
associate
order
with
requirement_3
pattern_2
practitioner
be
split
on
how
to
solve
the
problem
of
associate
resource
some
say
that
the
hierarchy
should
continue
to
grow
give
requirement_3

order
for
all
of
requirement_3
#5
s
order
and
requirement_3

order

for
requirement_3
#5
s
third
order
others
argue
to
keep
thing
flat
by
include
associate
detail
in
the
connector_data_1
for
a
resource
under
this
paradigm
create
an
order
require
a
customer_id
to
be
connector_11
with
the
order
detail
both
solution
be
use
by
pattern_2
component_2
in
the
wild
so
it
be
worth

about
each
figure

two
way
to
handle
associate
connector_data_1
in
component_1
design
search
connector_data_1
a
connector_data_1
in
a
component_12
grow
that
connector_data_7
all
component_13
become
impractical
imagine
if
our
pizza
parlor
have
three
million
complete
order
and
you
want
to
find
out
how
many
have
pepperoni
a
a
top
connector_12
a
connector_2
connector_data_8
to
order
and
connector_13
all
three
million
order
would
not
be
very
helpful
thankfully
pattern_2
have
a
nifty
way
for
search
through
connector_data_1
url
have
another
component_14
that
we
have
not
mention
yet
the
query
coding_keyword_5
query
mean
search
and
coding_keyword_5
mean
text
the
query
coding_keyword_5
be
a
bit
of
text
that
go
onto
the
end
of
a
url
to
pass
thing
along
to
the
technology_5
for
example
everything
after
the
question
mark
be
the
query
coding_keyword_5
in
technology_9
example
technology_10
order
key=value
pattern_2
component_2
use
the
query
coding_keyword_5
to
define
detail
of
a
search
these
detail
be
connector_8
query
parameter
the
component_1
dictate
what
parameter
it
will
connector_14
and
the
exact
name
of
those
parameter
need
to
be
use
for
them
to
effect
the
search
our
pizza
parlor
component_1
could
allow
the
component_9
to
search
for
order
by
top
by
use
this
url
technology_9
example
technology_10
order
topping=pepperoni
the
component_9
can
include
multiple
query
parameter
by
connector_data_7
one
after
another
separate
them
by
an
ampersand
&
for
example
technology_9
example
technology_10
order
topping=pepperoni&crust=thin
another
use
of
the
query
coding_keyword_5
be
to
limit
the
amount
of
connector_data_1
coding_keyword_6
in
each
connector_data_8
often
component_2
will
split
connector_data_11
into
set
say
of

or

component_15
and
coding_keyword_6
one
set
at
a
time
this
component_16
of
split
up
the
connector_data_1
be

a
pagination
an
analogy
to
break
up
word
into
component_17
for
book
to
allow
the
component_9
to
component_17
through
all
the
connector_data_1
the
component_1
will
support
query
parameter
that
allow
the
component_9
to
specify
which
component_17
of
connector_data_1
it
want
in
our
pizza
parlor
technology_5
we
can
support
component_17
by
allow
the
component_9
to
specify
two
parameter
component_17
and
size
if
the
component_9
make
a
connector_data_8
connector_2
order
page=2&size=200
we
they
want
the
second
component_17
of
connector_data_12
with

connector_data_11
per
component_17
so
order
