be
all
important
connector_data_1
to
carry
out
when
deal
with
a
large
set
of
component_2
because
those
component_3
be
bind
to
produce
requirement_1
both
with
useless
and
useful
connector_data_2
you
could
say
that
each
and
every
component_2
we
use
these
day
in
some
way
be
able
to
produce
a
requirement_1
which
will
alert
about
warn
error
and
critical
connector_data_3
–
which
should
be
pay
attention
to
immediately
it’s
not
the
most
pleasant
of
connector_data_4
to
work
hundred
of
gigabyte
of
requirement_2
try
to
manipulate
it
use
your
own
hand
build
technology_1
which
by
themselves
be
probably
go
to
end
up
cause
error
though
it’s
that
large
requirement_5
will
go
ahead
and
take
the
connector_2
of
self
serve
rather
than
pay
a
3rd
party
requirement_5
to
do
all
the
work
we’re
not
go
to
assume
the
position
of
a
large
requirement_5
middle
size
at
most
and
we
will
be
look
at
some
of
the
most
frequently
use
requirement_1
pattern_1
and
component_1
technology_1
on
the
requirement_6
they’ve
be
around
for
long
enough
to
find
their
place
on
this
connector_data_5
and
before
you
pour
it
down
for
not
have
your
favorite
in
the
connector_data_5
–
scroll
to
the
component_4
and
recommend
it
loggly
loggly
requirement_7
base
requirement_1
requirement_4
component_5
that
be
recommend
for
both
beginner
and
experience
developer
they
have
a
very
generous
200mb
pd
free
plan
which
will
give
you
a
glimpse
of
how
it
work
and
what
it
can
do
use
the
loggly
technology_2
technology_3
it
have
a
very
component_6
friendly
requirement_8
and
within
hour
of
start
to
use
loggly
to
pattern_2
your
requirement_1
you’ll
quality_attribute_1
understand
what
be
go
on
at
any
give
time
it’s
a
direct
“raw

visual”
type
of
requirement_1
pattern_1
component_7
papertrail
papertrail
be
for
be
very
easy
to
connector_3
and
offer
an
extensive
set
of
feature
additional
technology_1
to
make
requirement_1
requirement_4
a
technology_4
another
thing
they’ve
manage
to

notice
for
the
ability
to
quality_attribute_2
for
hundred
of

more
quality_attribute_3
connector_5
search
i
really
enjoy
their
full
text
search
which
enable
you
to
find
pretty
much
anything
narrow
down
to
the
very
last
thing
and
you
can
also
connector_6
those
search
with
co
component_9
which
really
make
all
the
difference
when
it
come

logentries
logentries
couple
powerful

mind
–
allow
it

to
quickly

easily
gain
actionable

connector_data_6
trust

around

analyze
billion
of

every
day
how
to
use
logentries
to
understand
your

i
think
what
stand
out
the
most
about

be
their
real

report
component_10
a

sole

–
easy
quality_attribute_3
and
most
important
quality_attribute_9
it’s
not
a
very
lightweight
requirement_1
requirement_4
technology_1
and
be
best
understand
after
connector_10
the
official
on
how
the
architecture
be
pattern_4
i’ve
only
that
it’s
quite
popular
among
the
real
time
connector_data_6
scientist
so
that
might
be
a
quality_attribute_1
lead
to
follow
technology_12
technology_15
it’s
not
directly
a
a
requirement_1
requirement_4
component_2
but
it
do
a
great
at
aggregate
connector_data_6
that’s
arrive
trough
multiple
component_13
to
the
technology_15
ecosystem
technology_15
be
well
for
be
able
to
publish
thousand
upon
thousand
of
connector_data_3
and
connector_data_7
per
second
a
lot
more
than
what
other
technology_1
on
the
requirement_6
might
be
able
to
do

be
for

the

that
build

from
the
grind
up
–
a
feat
that
many
dream
of
consider
that
multiple
high
level
requirement_5
be
now
use
technology_15
for
their
component_14
requirement_4
scribe
the
engineer
over
at
have
take
their
time
to
build
their
own
requirement_1
component_8
–
and
it
go
by
the
name
of
scribe
it
be
build
to
quality_attribute_2
and
to
aggregate
requirement_1
from
multiple
component_15
at
the
same
time
the
wikipedia
component_16
have
more
on
this
technology_1
for
requirement_1
requirement_4
and
analysis
i’m
with
you
on
the
fact
that
the
end
of
the
degrade
a
little
bit
i
suppose
it’s
easy
to
say
quality_attribute_1
thing
about
technology_18
pattern_5
component_7
than
it
be
about
open
component_11
project
which
be
mean
to
be
quality_attribute_10
to
your
own
specific
need
all
in
all
it’s
a
great
start
point
for

who
need
