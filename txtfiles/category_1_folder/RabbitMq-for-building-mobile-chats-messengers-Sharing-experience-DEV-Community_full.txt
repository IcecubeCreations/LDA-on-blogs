by
now
requirement_1
messenger
development
have
gain
significant
popularity
today
there
be
million
of
requirement_1
chat
and
messenger
with
the
most
famous
viber
whatsapp
or
telegram
each
have
it
pro
and
con
to
be
competitive
such
requirement_1
component_1
have
to
be
able
to
support
heavy
load
and
be
easily
quality_attribute_1
up
to
million
sometimes
billion
of
component_2
which
create
certain
challenge
for
developer
that‚Äôs
why
we
recommend
quality_attribute_2
ready
and
quality_attribute_3
pattern_1
component_3
in
these
solution
such
requirement_4
will
enable
to
transfer
the
solution
to
quality_attribute_4
problem
to
the
pattern_1
component_4
side
and
allow
to
pay
more
attention
to
requirement_5
development
one
of
the
component_3
that
be
a
quality_attribute_5
fit
for

development
be

connector_15
it
with
