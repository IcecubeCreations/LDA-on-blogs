update


in
this
we
will
look
at
how
to
requirement_1
technology_1
in
technology_2
use
different
technology_3
technology_1
stand
for
technology_4
connector_data_1
notation
and
it
be
base
on
a
subset
of
technology_4
a
a
connector_data_2
exchange
technology_5
it
be
widely
use
in
web
programming
here
we
show
how
to
requirement_1
technology_1
in
technology_2
use
the

technology_6
technology_3
a
technology_1
connector_data_1
be
an
unordered
set
of
key
requirement_2
pair
a
technology_1
be
an
order
collection
of
requirement_2
the
requirement_2
themselves
could
be
connector_data_3
or

we
will
be
requirement_1
this
technology_1
a
an
example
to
connector_1
requirement_2
for
pagename
pagepic
and
post_id{
pageinfo
{

how
to

in
technology_2

time_of_post

}
}
requirement_1
technology_1
use

technology_6
to
use

technology_6
to
requirement_1
technology_1
in
technology_2
you
need
to
the
technology_3
a
a
connector_2
this
can
be
fetch
from
technology_9
repositoryimport

technology_6
jsonarray

technology_6

parsejson
{
technology_6
=


args
{
obj
=

technology_6
pagename
=

}
}
}
n
b
the
need
to
be
replace
by
the
technology_1

this
have
be
omit
from
the
above
for
clarity
first
we
need
to
convert
the
technology_1
into
a
technology_1
connector_data_1
use

also
note
that
“pageinfo”
be
a
technology_1
connector_data_1
so
we
use
the
getjsonobject

likewise
“posts”
be
a
technology_1

so
we
need
to
use
the
getjsonarray

relate
how
to
convert
technology_2
connector_data_1
to
technology_1
how
to
convert
technology_2
connector_data_4
to
technology_1
how
to
encode
and
decode
technology_1
requirement_1
technology_1
use
technology_10
in
order
to
use
technology_10
to
requirement_1
technology_1
in
technology_2
you
need
to
the
technology_3
a
a
connector_2
you
can
connector_3
the
late
version
from
technology_9
pattern_1
the
below
example
show
how
to
requirement_1
the
above
technology_1
with
technology_10

technology_8

}
}
}
the
previous
example
the
need
to
be
replace
by
the
technology_1

requirement_1
technology_1
use
jsonpath
the
above
two
example
require
a
full
deserialization
of
the
technology_1
into
a
technology_2
connector_data_1
before
connector_4
the
requirement_2
in
the
property
of
interest
another
alternative
which
do
not
go
this
connector_5
be
to
use
jsonpath
which
be
technology_11
for
technology_1
and
allow
traverse
of
technology_1
connector_data_1
before
you
need
to
jsonpath
a
a
connector_2
which
can
be
fetch
from
technology_9
pattern_1
for
example
to
requirement_1
the
above
technology_1
we
can
use

technology_8
jayway
jsonpath
jsonpath
parsejson
{
technology_6
=

{
pagename
=
