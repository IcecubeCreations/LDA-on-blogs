the

processingi
recently
attend
the

connector_data_1
conference
and
discover
a
paradigm
shift
there
be
multiple
technology_9
both
open_source
and
commercial
that
developer
handle
connector_data_1
connector_4
or
real

connector_data_1
component_1
connector_data_3
there
be
also
commercial
technology_1
that
simplify

quality_attribute_4
pattern_3

connector_data_1
requirement_1
of
connector_data_1
connector_1
the
world
isn’t

to

connector_data_1
connector_9
be
a
lot
more
quality_attribute_6
today
than
two
or
three
year
ago
today’s
the
technology_1
architecture
and
approach
all
be
very
different
from
those
use
historically
for
connector_data_1
requirement_8
and
connector_data_1
warehousing
which
grow
up
during
an
era
of

you
develop

extract
connector_data_1
mostly
from

transform
it
into
a
quality_attribute_7
connector_data_4

load

they
be
