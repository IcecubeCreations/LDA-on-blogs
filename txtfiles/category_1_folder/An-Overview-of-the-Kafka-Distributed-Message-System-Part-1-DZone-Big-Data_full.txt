i
originally
intend
to
name
this
set
up
a
technology_1
connector_data_1
component_3
cluster
however
unlike
technology_5
technology_1
do
not
connector_4
connector_data_1
component_3
technology_6
for
example
advance
connector_data_1
pattern_3
technology_6
technology_7
technology_8
provide
advance
pattern_3
technology_6
for
unify
connector_data_1
component_4
it
be
an
open
technology_9
for
component_5
pattern_4
technology_6
and
design
for
connector_data_1
orient
technology_10
therefore
although
technology_1
s
usage
mode
be
more
a
component_3
it
be
still
not
strictly
a
connector_data_1
component_3
so
i
decide
to
give
this
a
more
generic
name
an
overview
of
technology_1
quality_attribute_1
connector_data_1
component_1
introduction
to
technology_1
linkedin
be
the
first
requirement_7
to
develop
technology_1
use
the
technology_2
and
technology_11
technology_12
it
component_6
be
open
component_6
in
and
it
become
a
top
project
of
the
technology_3
foundation
in
in
several
founder
of
technology_1
set
up
a
requirement_7
name
confluent
which
specialize
in
technology_1
the
purpose
of
the
technology_1
project
be
to
provide
a
unify
high
quality_attribute_3
and
low
delay
component_1
component_7
for
real
time
connector_data_2
component_8
technology_1
connector_5
the
follow
three
publish
and
subscription
technology_1
publish
subscription
connector_6
connector_data_2
similar
to
other
connector_data_1
component_1
component_8
technology_1
compile
a
connector_7
component_8
component_5
and
respond
to
real
time
storage
technology_1
securely
connector_8
connector_6
connector_data_2
in
a
quality_attribute_1
and
fault
tolerant
cluster
connector_data_1
component_1
technology_1
be
a
connector_data_1
component_1
u
understand
more
about
the
connector_data_1
component_1
and
the
problem
it
solve
take
the
currently
popular
pattern_5
architecture
a
an
example
s
assume
that
there
be
three
terminal
orient
wechat
official
account
requirement_8
component_9
and
browser
web
component_10
technology_13
technology_6
at
the
web
end
namely
web1
web2
and
web3
and
three
internal
component_5
component_10
app1
app2
and
app3
remote
connector_data_3
for
example
technology_14
and
grpc
if
there
be
no
connector_data_1
component_1
and
the
direct
connector_9
mode
be
adopt
the
connector_10
mode
between
them
be
a
follow
figure
connector_data_4
of
the
component_1
that
connector_11
in
the
direct
connector_9
mode
the
follow
issue
exist
while
adopt
this
mode
tightly
couple
component_10
increase
the
challenge
if
an
external
of
component_5
component_4
two
be
modify
all
component_11
invoke
the
would
require
modification
in
the
extreme
circumstance
show
above
where
all
component_11
invoke
the
which
be
rare
in
practice
all
other
web
and
component_5
component_10
would
require
modification
modify
an
with
tightly
couple
component_10
be
difficult
if
an
uncontrolled
third
party
component_5
invoke
the
the
would
require
a
modification
this
would
make
third
party
component_12
unavailable
modify
wechat
s
official
will
lead
to
a
failure
of
thousand
of
component_5
launch
different
version
of
an
be
the
resolution
to
this
problem
there
be
various
connector_12
mode
provide
such
a
web
v1
web
v1
and
component_9
v2
be
quality_attribute_4
among
minor
version
however
they
aren
t
quality_attribute_4
among
version
that
be
significantly
different
and
completely
tweak
although
the
above
plan
solve
the
issue
of
tight
couple
to
some
extent
this
isn
t
entirely
free
of
challenge
firstly
multiple
version
need
to
be
modify
should
there
be
an
update
and
secondly
a
large
number
of
version
need
quality_attribute_5
the
also
create
difficulty
in
it
become
complex
to
increase
or
decrease
component_13
if
component_5
component_4
be
now
to
provide
a
necessary
for
a
web
component_4
web
component_4
web
component_4
and
web
component_4
must
be
modify
similarly
if
component_5
component_4
be
no
long
require
the
that
be
use
to
invoke
this
component_4
must
be
remove
on
the
web
component_4
s
end
requirement_6
be
limit
and
expansion
become
difficult
for
example
it
be
imperative
to
use
a
third
party
technology_4
such
a
technology_15
or
consul
to
achieve
load
balance
an
alternative
approach
be
to
either
rewrite
the
or
specific
configuration
however
after
the
introduction
of
the
connector_data_1
component_1
the
connector_data_4
connector_13
a
below
figure
connector_data_4
of
the
component_1
after
the
introduction
of
the
connector_data_1
component_1
after
the
introduction
of
the
connector_data_1
component_1
all
the
issue
mention
previously
connector_3
resolve
component_14
web
component_4
and
component_5
component_10
no
long
need
to
be
concern
about
each
other
s
definition
instead
they
only
need
to
be
concern
about
the
connector_data_2
connector_data_4
technology_16
connector_data_4
there
isn
t
a
need
to
worry
about
the
connector_data_4
of
technology_1
it
be
mature
highly
technology_9
and
relatively
quality_attribute_6
however
the
technology_6
use
to
connector_14
with
technology_1
need
attention
technology_1
improve
requirement_6
it
be
not
only
design
to
connector_15
requirement_1
but
also
meet
the
requirement
of
most
requirement_9
with
it
quality_attribute_3
technology_1
make
expansion
easy
through
cluster
moreover
it
have
a
unique
component_15
that
provision
common
need
such
a
load
balance
two
connector_data_1
component_1
component_16
component_17
component_18
component_15
component_17
be
an
component_5
that
produce
connector_data_5
at
one
end
of
a
connector_data_2
pipeline
component_18
be
an
component_5
that
connector_16
connector_data_5
at
one
end
of
a
connector_data_2
pipeline
outline
below
be
the
two
scenario
when
the
component_17
connector_17
connector_data_5
to
a
component_3
if
no
component_18
connector_18
to
the
component_3
or
connector_16
connector_data_5
at
this
time
connector_data_5
be
connector_2
in
the
component_3
until
it
be
full
or
a
component_18
be
online
if
multiple
component_19
connector_19
to
the
component_3
at
this
time
one
component_18
connector_20
only
one
connector_data_1
therefore
load
balance
be
naturally
achieve
in
requirement_10
where
there
be
multiple
component_19
in
practice
pattern_6
pattern_7
component_15
pattern_6
an
component_5
that
generate
at
one
end
of
a
connector_data_2
pipeline
pattern_7
an
component_5
that
respond
to
at
one
end
of
a
connector_data_2
pipeline
in
the
pattern_6
pattern_7
component_15
the
connector_data_2
connector_21
to
a
component_3
be
in
the
form
of
instead
of
connector_data_1
in
this
requirement_10
connector_data_2
component_8
be
the
subscription
of
an
and
not
connector_data_1
consumption
if
no
pattern_7
connector_18
to
the
component_3
after
the
pattern_6
publish
an
the
connector_22
lose
i
e
no
component_5
respond
to
it
if
a
pattern_7
be
online
late
he
will
not
connector_23
the
in
requirement_10
if
multiple
pattern_7
connector_19
to
the
component_3
after
the
pattern_6
publish
an
at
the
same
time
the
connector_22
pattern_8
to
all
the
pattern_7
and
each
pattern_7
connector_20
the
same
therefore
load
balance
do
not
exist
connector_7
component_8
component_5
there
be
a
difference
between
pattern_9
component_8
component_12
and
connector_7
component_8
component_5
a
visible
boundary
determine
the
most
significant
difference
between
pattern_9
component_8
and
connector_7
component_8
if
it
exist
it
be
connector_24
pattern_9
component_8
for
example
a
component_13
connector_25
the
connector_data_2
once
every
hour
connector_17
this
connector_data_2
to
the
component_20
for
statistic
and
then
connector_26
the
statistical
connector_data_6
in
the
statistical
component_2
if
the
boundary
doesn
t
exist
the
component_8
be
connector_24
connector_6
connector_data_2
connector_7
component_8
here
be
an
example
of
connector_7
component_8
requirement_2
and
order
be
generate
continuously
on
a
large
a
connector_data_2
flow
if
the
component_8
of
each
requirement_2
and
order
take
le
than
several
hundred
millisecond
or
several
second
after
it
generation
the
component_5
be
connector_24
a
connector_7
component_5
if
the
collection
of
requirement_2
and
order
happen
once
every
hour
follow
by
a
unify
transmission
the
original
connector_7
connector_data_2
convert
into
pattern_9
connector_data_2
occasionally
connector_7
component_8
become
imperative
for
example
jack
ma
want
to
display
the
order
and
sale
on
tmall
for
on
a
large
screen
if
the
connector_data_2
center
work
in
a
t+1
mode
and
can
obtain
connector_data_2
for
on
jack
ma
would
not
be
happy
the
for
component_8
connector_7
connector_data_2
be
different
from
the
for
component_8
pattern_9
connector_data_2
technology_1
provide
a
unique
component_14
technology_1
connector_7
to
component_8
connector_7
connector_data_2
technology_1
offer
different
element
for
other
project
in
the
technology_17
ecosystem
for
example
technology_18
also
u
technology_18
connector_6
to
component_8
connector_7
connector_data_2
technology_19
be
the
first
component_1
that
be
build
to
component_8
connector_7
connector_data_2
exclusively
apart
from
connector_data_2
boundary
component_8
time
can
be
use
to
differentiate
connector_7
component_8
and
pattern_9
component_8
the
component_8
cycle
for
pattern_9
component_8
be
generally
hour
or
day
while
the
component_8
cycle
for
connector_7
component_8
be
usually
second
correspondingly
pattern_9
component_8
be
refer
to
a
offline
connector_data_2
component_8
whereas
connector_7
component_8
be
refer
to
a
real
time
connector_data_2
component_8
in
the
unit
of
minute
connector_data_2
component_8
be
refer
a
near
line
connector_data_2
component_8
however
connector_data_2
component_8
be
seldom
discus
and
generally
component_8
offline
unless
the
component_8
cycle
slow
down
storage
technology_1
securely
connector_8
connector_data_2
in
a
quality_attribute_1
and
fault
tolerant
cluster
the
default
storage
period
be
one
week
additionally
technology_1
naturally
support
cluster
technology_1
allow
u
to
conveniently
or
reduce
component_21
and
specify
the
number
of
copy
for
connector_data_2
this
ensure
that
the
cluster
provide
break
free
component_10
even
when
individual
component_22
in
the
cluster
break
down
technology_1
be
primarily
use
to
connector_15
connector_data_2
in
our
connector_data_2
center
project
me
first
introduce
the
background
of
this
project
and
then
provide
an
understand
of
issue
that
technology_1
solve
at
present
component_12
be
run
in
the
front
end
which
might
increase
with
time
the
front
end
component_12
connector_27
connector_data_2
to
the
backend
connector_data_2
center
an
component_5
connector_24
connector_data_2
collector
or
collector
for
short
the
collector
correspond
to
multiple
component_5
while
it
be
idle
most
of
the
time
when
numerous
component_12
connector_27
connector_data_2
at
the
same
time
the
collector
isn
t
able
to
component_8
the
connector_data_2
in
this
requirement_10
there
be
a
requirement
for
buffer
mechanism
so
that
the
collector
be
not
too
idle
or
busy
technology_1
be
useful
a
a
buffer
pool
for
the
connector_data_2
in
such
situation
in
this
example
instead
of
select
a
traditional
connector_data_1
component_3
component_14
such
a
technology_5
i
have
selected
technology_1
this
be
because
technology_1
be
inherently
develop
to
cope
with
a
large
pattern_9
of
connector_data_2
and
provide
quality_attribute_7
requirement_6
technology_1
serve
the
of
smooth
upgrade
in
a
connector_data_2
center
in
addition
to
connector_data_2
buffer
outline
below
be
a
quick
diagrammatic
representation
figure
smooth
upgrade
in
the
previous
use
requirement_10
we
use
technology_20
for
develop
front
end
connector_data_2
collection
and
connector_data_2
clean
component_5
m
technology_21
connector_8
the
same
requirement_1
technology_22
help
u
to
component_23
large
amount
of
connector_data_2
on
the
technology_23
and
technology_18
help
u
to
connector_28
statistic
there
be
no
need
to
connector_29
the
previous
version
of
front
end
connector_data_2
collection
or
connector_data_2
clean
component_12
after
introduce
technology_1
the
version
of
collection
or
clean
component_12
can
be
connector_30
because
technology_1
allow
u
to
extract
connector_data_2
at
any
point
in
time
it
be
easy
to
switch
to
the
component_1
by
simply
stop
previous
version
of
the
component_12
once
the
version
pass
the
test

technology_1
the
follow
connector_13
take
place
although
the
component_12
in
the
component_1
be
not
mutually
dependent
they
quality_attribute_8
heavily
on
technology_1
quality_attribute_9
of
technology_1
therefore
become
very
important
similar
to
infrastructure
such
a
technology_21
component_20
in

connector_4
pattern_2
pattern_2
offer
decentralization
a
each
component_4
can
independently
work
without
quality_attribute_8
on
the

it
be
critical
to
determine
when
to
use
these
two
mode
a
connector_data_1
component_3
be
naturally
pattern_10
although
a
connector_data_1
component_3
improve
requirement_6
it
increase
complexity
initially
it
be
quality_attribute_10
to
invoke
connector_data_6
by
use
