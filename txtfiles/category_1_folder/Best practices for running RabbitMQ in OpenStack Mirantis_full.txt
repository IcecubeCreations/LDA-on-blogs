best
practice
for
run
technology_1
in
technology_3
dmitry
mescheryakov
technology_1
technology_3
connector_data_1
component_1
technology_3
be
dependent
on
connector_data_1
component_1
so
it
s
crucial
that
you
have
the
best
possible
setup
most
deployment
include
technology_1
so
s
take
a
few
minute
to
look
at
best
practice
for
make
certain
it
run
a
efficiently
a
possible
quality_attribute_2
technology_1
on
dedicate
technology_5
with
dedicate
technology_5
technology_1
be
isolate
from
other
cpu
hungry
component_2
and
hence
can
sustain
more
stress
this
isolation
option
be
quality_attribute_3
in
mirantis
technology_3
start
from
version
for
more
connector_data_2
do
a
search
for
‘detach
rabbitmq’
on
the
validate
plugins
component_3
run
technology_1
with
hipe
hipe
stand
for
high
requirement_2
technology_6
when
hipe
be
enable
the
technology_6
component_4
be
pre
compile
into
component_5
before
be
connector_1
our
benchmark
show
that
this
give
technology_1
a
requirement_2
technology_7
up
to
30%
if
you
re
into
that
sort
of
thing
you
can
find
the
benchmark
detail
here
and
the
connector_data_3
be
here
the
drawback
with
do
thing
this
way
be
that
component_4
initial
start
time
increase
considerably
while
the
technology_6
component_4
be
compile
with
hipe
the
first
technology_1
start
take
around
minute
another
subtle
drawback
we
have
discover
be
that
if
hipe
be
enable
debug
technology_1
might
be
hard
a
hipe
can
spoil
error
tracebacks
render
them
unreadable
hipe
be
enable
in
mirantis
technology_3
start
with
version
do
not
use
component_1
mirror
for
pattern_1
component_6
our
research
show
that
enabling
component_1
mirror
on
a
technology_5
cluster
make
connector_data_1
quality_attribute_4
drop
twice
you
can
see
this
effect
in
publicly
quality_attribute_3
connector_data_4
produce
by
mirantis
quality_attribute_5
team
test
report
on
the
other
side
pattern_1
connector_data_5
become
obsolete
pretty
quickly
minute
and
if
connector_data_5
be
lose
it
lead
only
to
failure
of
current
in
progress
so
overall
pattern_1
component_6
without
mirror
seem
to
be
a
quality_attribute_6
tradeoff
at
mirantis
you
generally
enable
component_1
mirror
only
for
ceilometer
component_1
where
connector_data_5
must
be
preserve
you
can
see
how
we
define
such
a
technology_1
requirement_3
here
the
option
to
turn
off
component_1
mirror
be
quality_attribute_3
in
mo
start
in
mirantis
technology_3
and
be
enable
by
default
for
pattern_1
component_6
start
in
version
use
a
separate
technology_1
cluster
for
ceilometer
in
general
ceilometer
doesn
t
connector_2
many
connector_data_5
through
technology_1
but
if
ceilometer
connector_3
stick
it
component_6
overflow
that
lead
to
technology_1
crash
which
in
turn
cause
outage
for
other
technology_3
component_7
the
ability
to
use
a
separate
technology_1
cluster
for
connector_data_6
be
quality_attribute_3
start
with
technology_3
mitaka
mo
and
be
not
support
in
mo
out
of
the
component_8
the
feature
be
not
document
yet
but
you
can
find
the
implementation
here
reduce
ceilometer
metric
volume
another
best
practice
when
it
come
to
run
technology_1
beneath
technology_3
be
to
reduce
the
number
of
metric
connector_4
and
or
their
frequency
obviously
that
reduce
stress
put
on
technology_1
ceilometer
and
technology_8
but
it
also
reduce
the
chance
of
connector_data_5
pile
up
in
technology_1
if
ceilometer
technology_8
can
t
cope
with
their
volume
in
turn
connector_data_5
pile
up
in
a
component_1
reduce
overall
technology_1
requirement_2
you
can
also
mitigate
the
effect
of
connector_data_5
pile
up
by
use
rabbitmq’s
lazy
component_6
feature
quality_attribute_3
start
with
technology_1
but
a
of
this
connector_5
mo
do
not
make
use
of
lazy
component_1
carefully
consider
disable
component_1
mirror
for
ceilometer
component_6
in
the
mirantis
technology_3
architecture
component_1
mirror
be
the
only
‘persistence’
measure
use
we
do
not
use
quality_attribute_7
component_1
so
do
not
disable
component_1
mirror
if
lose
ceilometer
connector_data_6
will
hurt
you
for
example
if
connector_data_6
connector_data_4
be
use
for
bill
you
can
t
afford
to
lose
those
connector_data_6
the
ability
to
disable
mirror
for
ceilometer
component_6
be
quality_attribute_3
in
mirantis
technology_3
start
with
version
but
it
be
disable
by
