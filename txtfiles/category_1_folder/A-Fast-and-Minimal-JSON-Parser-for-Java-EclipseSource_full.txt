the
rap
project
connector_1
and
connector_2
technology_1
be
critical
since
the
component_4
component_5
and
create
technology_1
connector_data_1
for
a
large
number
of
component_6
at
a
high
rate
for
this
reason
we
need
something
fast
for
this
when
we
switch
to
technology_7
we
include
the
technology_7
requirement_1
which
be
reasonably
small
but
not
famous
for
it
requirement_2
there
be
many
quality_attribute_1
technology_1
technology_8
out
there
but
most
do
much
more
than
we
need
we
really
only
need
a
bare
bone
requirement_1
that
can
connector_3
technology_1
into
a
quality_attribute_2
technology_2
representation
and
generate
technology_1
from
technology_2
a
we
to
keep
the
core
technology_8
self
contain
we
don’t
want
a
connector_4
to
an
external
technology_1
technology_8
one
winter
sunday
i
start
to
connector_5
a
technology_1
requirement_1
for
the
fun
of
it
and
be
quickly
surprise
how
quality_attribute_2
it
be
to
requirement_3
technology_7
look
for
more
useful
technology_6
see
our
eclipse
technology_6
component_7
|
need
expert
advice
for
your
project
our
developer
support
be
here
to
resolve
your
question
why
be
technology_1
requirement_3
so
easy
that’s
because
the
first
character
of
every
connector_data_2
uniquely
define
it
type
for
an
for
a
t
or
f
for
a
boolean
and
so
forth
there’s
no
backtrack
involve
it
go
so
well
that
i
decide
to
continue
and
create
a
technology_1
requirement_1
quality_attribute_3
to
our
need
which
be
fast
–
we
connector_3
and
create
so
much
technology_1
that
the
requirement_1
directly
affect
the
component_4
requirement_2
lightweight
–
it
should
deal
with
memory
sparingly
a
we
deal
with
lot
of
connector_data_1
minimal
–
the
le
the
quality_attribute_1
a
we
have
to
maintain
it
quality_attribute_2
to
use
–
we’ll
connector_6
the
component_8
for
custom
component_9
developer
so
it
should
be
quality_attribute_2
and
clear
no
connector_4
–
only
technology_2
5the
connector_data_3
be
connector_7
minimal
technology_7
and
it’s
already
include
in
rap
it
be
fast
lightweight
consist
only
of
and
i
hope
it’s
quality_attribute_2
to
use

the

a
you
can
see
the
connector_9
always
an
instance
of
jsonvalue
which
can
then
be
transform
to
the
target
type
use
asstring
asint
asdouble
etc
there’s
no
automatic
conversion
to
technology_2
type
no
instanceof
need
if
you’re
not
sure
about
the
type
of
a
requirement_4
you
can
connector_11
it
use
isstring
isnumber
etc
nest
and
connector_data_5
can
be
connector_10
use
asarray
and
asobject
jsonarray
nestedarray

you
can
also
iterate
over
the
element
of
an
jsonarray
and
the
name
of
a
e
g
for

name
{
jsonvalue
requirement_4

}writing
jsona
or
jsonarray
can
output
technology_1
to
a

or
a

to
create

these
the

you
have
notice
that
also
the
connector_data_4
have
an
instead
of
a
put
or
set
that’s
because
the
connector_12
and
connector_13
it
member
in
the
order
they
be
it
allow
you
to
define
the
output
order
it
even
allow
you
to
the
same
key
twice
which
be
discourage
but
not
forbid
by
the
technology_1
rfc
to
replace
an
element
in
an
of
connector_data_4
you
first
have
to
remove
the
old
requirement_4
and
then
the
one
a
replace
be
late
however
jsonarray

be
design
to
be
container
for
connector_1
and
connector_2
technology_7
not
general
purpose
connector_data_6
connector_data_7
performancei’ve
compare
the
time
require
to
connector_3
and
connector_5
a
typical
rap
connector_data_8
with
other
popular
requirement_1
implementation
namely
technology_7
technology_10
technology_11
and
technology_7
quality_attribute_2
disclaimer
this
benchmark
be
restrict
to
our
use
requirement_5
and
my
limit
knowledge
on
the
other
technology_8
it
be
unfair
a
it
ignore
other
use
requirement_5
and
perhaps
quality_attribute_1
way
to
use
these
technology_8
however
i
think
these
connector_data_9
show
that
minimal
technology_7
can
take
comparison
with
state
of
the
art
requirement_1
i
also
run
a
number
of
micro
benchmark
use
caliper
while
optimize
the
implementation
one
interest
detail
be
the
choice
of
the
connector_data_6
connector_data_7
for
the
since
technology_1
connector_data_5
be
key
requirement_4
connector_data_10
a
hashmap
seem
an
obvious
choice
however
after
some
experiment
i
end
up
with
two
separate
arraylists
for
name
and
requirement_4
of
look
up
a
key
in
a
connector_data_11
require
a
linear
search
while
a
hash
pattern_1
be
much
quicker
however
create
a
hashmap
and
element
have
a
considerable
overhead
it
turn
out
that
this
overhead
squash
the
benefit
of
a
hashmap
for
very
small
number
of
connector_data_12
since
technology_1
connector_data_1
in
rap
typically
contain
many
connector_data_5
with
only
a
few
item
a
hashmap
would
even
impair
the
overall
requirement_2
moreover
the
two
arraylists
require
le
than
a
third
of
the
footprint
of
a
hashmap
i
be
able
to
improve
the
pattern_1
requirement_2
for
small
item
count
by
a
very
small
hash
connector_data_7
to
the
name
connector_data_11
this
connector_data_7
consist
of
a
element
byte
it
do
not
handle
collision
but
resort
to
indexof
in
requirement_5
of
a
miss
this
version
show
in
the
middle
of
the
requirement_6
above
seem
to
be
a
quality_attribute_1
compromise
between
hashmap
and
plain
arraylist
optimization
for
big
technology_1
connector_data_5
be
possible
but
not
need
at
the
moment
how
to
use
itif
you’re
look
for
a
bare
bone
technology_1
requirement_1
with
zero
connector_4
you
be
welcome
to
use
minimal
technology_7
it
go
without
say
that
it’s
develop
test
drive
and
comply
with
the
rfc
the
life
at
technology_12
and
be
epl
license
it
be
also
include
in
rap
i
didn’t
setup
a
build
if
you
would
to
use
the
i
suggest
that
you
simply
copy
these
technology_2
to
your
project
me
if
you
find
this
useful
fork
it
on
technology_12
and
feel
free
to
open
