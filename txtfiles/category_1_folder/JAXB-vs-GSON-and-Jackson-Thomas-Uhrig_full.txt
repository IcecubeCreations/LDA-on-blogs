technology_1
vs
technology_2
and
technology_3
connector_data_1
vs
technology_4
the
discussion
about
connector_data_1
and
technology_4
be
a
old
a
the
internet
itself
if
you
connector_data_1
vs
technology_4
you
will
connector_1
about


million
connector_data_2
and
here
be
mine
–
a
comparison
of
the
requirement_2
quality_attribute_1
of
technology_1
technology_2
and
technology_3
connector_data_1
connector_data_1
hold
connector_data_3
between
name
technology_5
which
could
have
attribute
too
each
technology_5
can
hold
child
technology_5
or
some
connector_data_3
a
typical
connector_data_1
would
look
this


name=
math
student
jon
doe
student

connector_data_1
itself
be
pretty
quality_attribute_2
but
come
with
a
totally
over
engineer
ecosystem
there
exist
different
type
of
validation
technology_6
query
technology_7
transformation
technology_7
and
weird
dialect
if
you
have
an
connector_data_1
during
your
study
the
most
difficult
part
be
to
instantiate
the
connector_data_1
requirement_3
in
technology_8

documentbuilderfactory
documentbuilder
document
element
technology_4
technology_4
hold
connector_data_3
a
technology_9
connector_data_4
it
have
two
type
of
notation
connector_data_5
enclose
in
and
connector_data_6
enclose
in
{
}
the
document
from
above
could
look
this

{
name
math
student
{
name
jon
doe
}
}
compare
to
technology_10
technology_4
be
more
lean
and
lightweight
the
technology_11
contain
le
clutter
and
there
be
not
a
much
technology_12
a
for
connector_data_1
e
g
not
query
or
transformation
technology_7
requirement_2
quality_attribute_1
test
since
technology_4
be
a
lean
technology_11
i
be
wonder
if
a
technology_4
could
be
requirement_2
fast
than
an
equivalent
connector_data_1

in
the
end
both
technology_11
contain
the
same
connector_data_3
in
a
hierarchical
representation
of
technology_5
and
element
so
be
there
any
difference
test
connector_data_3
i
create
a
quality_attribute_2
test
connector_data_3
a
connector_2
could
hold
a
connector_data_7
of
student
connector_data_6
and
topic
connector_data_4
each
connector_data_4
have
some
property
such
a
a
name
before
each
test
i
create
a
connector_data_4
fill
with
random
requirement_4
i
make
my
test
with







and


student

repeat

fast
a
little
the
first
connector_data_2
of
my
test
be
that
technology_3
technology_14
connector_3
connector_data_3
a
little
bit
fast
than
technology_1
technology_10
and
technology_2
technology_14
the
difference
be
not
that
big
technology_4
connector_4
fast
a
lot
more
interest
be
the
fact
that
both
technology_4
implementation
technology_3
and
technology_2
connector_5
connector_data_3
much
fast
than
technology_1
technology_4
be
small
ok
this
one
be
a
no
brainer
but
technology_4
be
of

small
than
connector_data_1

in
my
example
the
technology_4
be
about
68%
of
the
size
of
the
correspond
connector_data_1

however
this
highly
quality_attribute_3
on
you
connector_data_3
if
the
connector_data_3
inside
the
technology_5
be
large
the
overhead
of
the
connector_data_1
tag
be
not
a
much
a
for
very
small
connector_data_3
