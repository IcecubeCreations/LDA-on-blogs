you
can
connector_3
the

snippet
of
technology_1
use
technology_2
and
technology_3
purpose
of
pattern_2
pattern_2
provide
a
mechanism
for
loosely
couple
requirement_1
of
component_2
component_3
or

component_4
and
even
multiple
component_5
together
it
provide
a
way
to
connector_4
loosely
asynchronously
and
progressively
there
be
many
technology_4
that
exist
that
provide
this
feature
and

be
a

that
technology_1
us
for
connector_data_1
although
technology_1
support
some
other

technology_5
be
most
preferable
due
to
quality_attribute_4
and
the
large
set
of

it
offer
technology_1
technology_1
be

note
that

also
require

work
you
can
find

you
have

start
instal

you
can
go

you
can
visit

anytime
to
see
