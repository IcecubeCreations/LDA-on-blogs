introduction
tune
be
a
very
interest
topic
in
the
of
engineering
everybody
can
agree
that
it’s
important
but
i
have
rarely
see
people
actually
do
it
this
can
be
especially
true
when
people
have
spare
computational
resource
to
spend
or
if
they
be
follow
these
mantra
“the
load
won’t
reach
at
this
point”
or
“let
the
requirement_7
quality_attribute_4
it
”
the
goal
of
this
coding_keyword_3
be
to
connector_4
some
insight
regard
tune
an
technology_1
technology_2
component_1
quality_attribute_1
into
technology_3
this
be
not
an
ultimate
guide
for
tune
and
requirement_9
test
in
technology_3
component_1
but
more
of
an
experience
connector_5
during
a
tune
component_7
when
talk
about
tune
and
requirement_9
test
one
thing
that
need
to
be
clear
be
the
requirement
or
what
do
you
want
to
achieve
by
tune
an
component_1
for
example
one
could
say
that
with
the
computational
resource
they
have
they
aim
for
a
10%
increase
of
connector_data_3
the
component_1
can
handle
we
create
a
fictional
scenario
to
make
thing
easy
and
to
define
a
requirement
where
we
can
apply
the
propose
tune
configuration
also
for
you
to
be
able
to
replicate
the
topic
discuss
in
this
coding_keyword_3
there
be
a
demonstration
lab
quality_attribute_5
at
technology_10
this
lab
have
what
you
should
need
to
create
the
environment
and
run
the
load
test
while
explore
the
configuration
connector_6
connector_7
in
the
follow
section
the
scenario
thing
connector_8
clear
when
we
demonstrate
by
example
so
let’s
use
a
fictional
scenario
to
do
so
a
requirement_2
be
ask
to
improve
the
number
of
transaction
per
second
tps
that
their
pattern_2
technology_1
technology_2
component_1
quality_attribute_1
into
technology_3
can
handle
the
requirement
be
very
strict
can’t
increase
memory
cpu
or
disk
the
architecture
must
remain
intact
can’t
connector_9

the
follow

illustrate
the

in
this

also
offer

technology_3
with
an

this

always
use
by
the

that
be
be
quality_attribute_6
with
external

third

component_1
in
this
scenario
connector_data_3
be
treat
by
the
pattern_3

through
an

and
then
pass
to
the

component_1
the
component_1

to
an
external

transform
or
compose
the
connector_13
connector_data_2
and
then
coding_keyword_4
a
connector_14
to
the
component_10
every
component_11
of
this
architecture
be
compress
inside
a
virtual
component_12
with
512mb
of
ram
and

vcpus
the
resource
be
sparse
to
emulate
a
possible
real
world
scenario
where
a
potential
requirement_2
be
ask
for
requirement_9
improvement
in
this
environment
without
have
to
invest
in
hardware
resource
nor
modify
the
architecture
or
the
component_1
component_8

with
such
narrow
requirement
where
would
you
start
let’s
begin
our
tune
plan
use
a
very
old
war
strategy
dīvide
et
imperā
divide
and
conquer
let’s
navigate
by
each
component_11
in
the
architecture
and
explore
what
be
do
in
this
scenario
to
tune
the
environment
each
configuration
connector_9
propose
be
document
in
a
demonstration
lab
that
could
be
replicate
in
other
environment
in
the
next
section
we’re
go
to
discus
each
decision
base
on
this
example
scenario
technology_1
httpd
web
component_9
the
technology_1
httpd
web
component_9
play
an
important
role
in
the
architecture
by
connector_10
connector_11
pattern_5
and
proxying
connector_data_3
to
underlie
technology_12
component_7
when
instal
in
a
linux
component_12
the
httpd
web
component_9
come
with
default
requirement_10
that
could
fit
most
use
requirement_5
scenario
but
when
the
workload
start
to
increase
you
might
face
requirement_9
problem
pattern_3
timeout
error
low
throughout
and
high
component_12
resource
usage
here
we’ll
work
with
technology_1


since
it’s
the
current
version
and
include
several
bug
and
quality_attribute_3
fix
the
connector_15
doc
and
cod
here
will
be
relate
to
technology_1
httpd


switch
the
mpm
the
first
thing
that
be
do
be
choose
the
right
multi
component_7
mpm
for
our
use
requirement_5
scenario
by
default
the
mpm
configure
in
httpd
be
prefork
which
fit
for
use
requirement_5
that
need
quality_attribute_7
with
technology_13
that
be
non
component_13
quality_attribute_8
some
old
technology_14
technology_13
in
this
requirement_5
we
be
go
to
connector_9
to
the
component_14
mpm
that
be
much
more
performatic
and
suitable
for
our
scenario
since
we
don’t
need
httpd
to
load
any
non
component_13
quality_attribute_8
technology_13
nor
serve
dynamic
script
the
component_14
mpm
connector_16
a
multi
component_7
multi
component_13
component_9
and
accord
to
the
component_14
documentation
by
use
component_15
to
serve
connector_data_4
it
be
able
to
serve
a
large
number
of
connector_data_3
with
few
component_16
resource
than
a
component_7
base
component_9
it’s
worth
note
that
the
component_14
mpm
might
be
quality_attribute_9
than
prefork
in
other
scenario
a
well
a
long
a
you
don’t
need
quality_attribute_7
with
non
component_13
quality_attribute_8
technology_13
another
approach
that
could
be
use
be
the
mpm
but
because
of
a
bug
in
the
httpd
version
we
be
work
with
at
the
time
of
this

we
decide
to
stick
with
component_14
set
the
connector_11
parameter
once
the
component_14
mpm
be
configure
the
next
thing
that
to
do
be
define
a
consistent
number
for
the
maxrequestworkers
parameter
in
general
we
use

time
the
number
of
cpu
core
for
component_14
mpm
but
of
a
lot
of
fine
tune
and
experimentation
have
to
be
do
don’t
blindly
set
this
parameter
without
properly
test
if
we
follow
the
general
advice
of

*
cpu
core
the
max
number
of
connector_11
that
the
httpd
component_9
would
serve
in
our
architecture
be

we
have

vcpus
for
each
component_12
but
be
this
number
realistic
in
our
scenario
the
httpd
component_9
and
the
technology_15
component_9
be
in
the
same
component_12
so
they
be
compete
for
resource
the
httpd
component_9
should
serve
more
connector_data_3
than
the
technology_15
because
it’s
act
simply
a
a
pattern_3
component_9
while
the
technology_15
component_9
be
the
one
who
be
perform
all
the
heavy
work
by
component_7
our
requirement_11
component_6
have
say
that
the
pattern_3
component_9
should
act
a
gatekeeper
to
help
avoid
component_7
more
connector_data_3
than
the
underlie
component_1
component_9
can
handle
to
come
up
with
an
ideal
number
a
lot
of
experimentation
with
load
test
have
to
be
do
at
the
component_1
component_9
to
figure
out
how
many
concurrent
connector_data_3
it
can
handle
after
that
set
a
number
below
this
one
to
the
httpd
this
be
the
final
configuration
i
come
up
with
ifmodule
mpm_worker_module
threadlimit

serverlimit

startservers

minsparethreads

maxsparethreads

maxrequestworkers

threadsperchild

maxrequestsperchild

timeout

proxytimeout

ifmodule
take
into
account
the
component_12
resource
that
we
have
in
our
scenario
the
maximum
number
of
connector_data_3
that
technology_15
handle
without
error
while
leave
some
room
for
the
other
component_17
in
the
component_12
be

so
we
set
the
max
connector_11
to

in
the
pattern_3
component_9
which
prove
to
be
a
fine
configuration
for
this
scenario
this
way
the
workload
on
technology_15
won’t
reach
the
maximum
preserve
it
healthy
state
in
most
situation
also

simultaneous
connector_11
be
enough
to
connector_7
the
customer’s
requirement
other
important
parameter
to
pay
attention
to
be
timeout
and
proxytimeout
those
number
should
be
set
equally
to
the
underlie
technology_15
component_9
so
if
the
component_1
time
out
the
error
propagate
to
the
component_10
otherwise
you
could
have
connector_11
open
at
the
pattern_3
component_9
spend
valuable
component_12
resource
connector_9
pattern_3
pass
connector
to
ajp
the
last
tune
configuration
that
be
set
in
this
scenario
be
the
ajp
connector_11
to
the
technology_15
component_9
a
basic
pattern_3
pass
configuration
be
to
bypass
connector_data_3
to
the
underlie
component_9
use
the
technology_16
technology_17
instead
we
use
the
ajp
technology_17
which
be
a
binary
technology_17
representation
of
the
technology_16
technology_17
that
also
skip
technology_16
coding_keyword_5
re
component_7
by
the
underlie
component_9
this
way
we
connector_17
a
little
bit
of
component_7
power
the
final
configuration
look

location
svc
proxypass
ajp
localhost

location
final
thought
these
be
the
tune
configuration
do
so
far
at
the
technology_16
component_9
side
switch
the
mpm
from
prefork
to
component_14
adjust
the
max
connector_11
that
the
pattern_3
component_9
can
handle
to
preserve
component_12
resource
and
also
protect
the
component_1
component_9
from
a
workload
that
it
can’t
handle
set
a
proper
timeout
configuration
align
with
the
technology_15
component_9
connector_9
the
pattern_3
pass
technology_17
from
technology_16
to
ajp
of

there
be
a
lot
of
other
thing
that
could
be
do
there
be
other
guide
on
the
internet
describe
how
to
tune
an
technology_1
httpd
component_9
but
for
this
scenario
and
use
requirement_5
we
find
that
these
configuration
be
enough
to
accomplish
our
requirement_2
requirement
embed
technology_15
the
role
of
the
technology_15
component_9
in
this
architecture
be
to
serve
a
a
servlet
container
to
the
technology_1
technology_2
pattern_2
component_11
this
implementation
be
manage
by
the
technology_3
web
a
an
embed
component_9
there
be
other
servlet
implementation
to
work
with
technology_3
and
technology_1
technology_2
undertow
and
technology_18
that
might
perform
quality_attribute_9
but
the
requirement
of
the
requirement_2
be
not
to
connector_9
any
piece
of
their
architecture
have
say
that
what
can
be
do
at
the
configuration
level
to
have
the
technology_1
technology_15
component_9
perform
quality_attribute_9
adjust
the
connector_11
parameter
first
of
all
we
say
in
the
technology_1
httpd
section
the
technology_15
component_9
be
test
alone
to
figure
out
how
many
connector_data_3
it
could
handle
in
the
most
common
use
requirement_5
for
this
connector_data_5
you
could
use
the
pareto
distribution
to
have
a
sample
amount
of
connector_data_3
to
test
the
component_1
for
example
use
an
component_18
which
connector_18
create
and
delete
requirement_2
the
connector_18
and
create
could
be
the
most
common
use
requirement_5
you
can
create
a
small
set
of
sample
connector_data_3
and
start
put
some
workload
on
your
component_9
jmeter
be
a
reasonable
technology_19
to
do
that
and
we
use
this
technology_19
in
our
lab
have
come
up
with
the
max
concurrent
connector_data_3
that
the
component_1
could
handle
during
a
certain
period
of
time
without
break
we
adjust
the
component_9
parameter
this
parameter
requirement_10
description
connector_11
timeout
m

this
requirement_10
be
align
with
the
technology_1
httpd
pattern_3
component_9
timeout
and
have
show
to
be
a
reasonable
number
for
our
scenario
compression
false
we
be
serve
only
small
technology_20
connector_data_6
and
in
our
test
the
compression
didn’t
make
any
noticeable
difference
besides
this
can
be
set
only
at
the
pattern_3
component_9
level
max
connector_11

a
little
more
than
the
max
connector_11
at
the
pattern_3
component_9
side
so
we
have
room
to
handle
extra
connector_11
that
could
come
between
connector_data_4
max
component_15

this
number
seem
reasonable
for
our
resource
and
number
of
connector_11
to
handle
each
component_13
can
handle
more
than
one
connector_11
min
spare
component_15

there’s
no
pattern_6
up
for
this
component_9
which
mean
that
during
high
load
there
be
no
need
to
create
more
component_15
reach
the
max
to
handle
all
the
connector_data_4
but
during
idle
or
low
workload
these
component_15
be
up
although
do
nothing
in
our
scenario
there
wasn’t
too
much
idle
time
that
would
justify
decreasing
this
number
connector_19
count

the
number
of
connector_11
wait
to
be
handle
if
we
reach
the
max
connector_11
number
the
component_9
start
to
technology_21
connector_data_3
in
this
component_19
before
deny
a
connector_data_7
to
the
component_10
of

a
lot
of
experimentation
and
load
test
have
be
do
these
number
be
for
reference
only
and
be
the
one
set
in
our
lab
these
number
can
be
completely
different
quality_attribute_2
on
your
requirement
keep
in
mind
the
responsibility
of
evaluate
each
parameter
and
determine
what
you
can
do
to
improve
the
requirement_9
of
your
component_9
by
fine
tune
each
one
take
a
look
at
the
documentation
to
understand
the
parameter
that
can
be
configure
in
the
technology_15
connector
use
technology_15
requirement_8
connector
the
next
adjustment
make
on
the
technology_15
component_9
be
to
use
the
requirement_8
connector
to
handle
the
connector_11
come
up
from
the
pattern_3
component_9
quote
from
the
official
documentation
“the
technology_1
technology_15
requirement_8
technology_13
be
an
optional
component_11
for
use
with
technology_1
technology_15
that
allow
technology_15
to
use
certain
requirement_8
resource
for
requirement_9
quality_attribute_7
etc
”
the
decision
to
use
the
requirement_8
technology_13
be
guide
by
the
requirement_9
improvement
this
can
offer
versus
the
technology_22
technology_23
technology_13
bio
or
technology_24
leverage
from
the
o
capability
to
handle
i
o

for
this
to
work
we
have
to
install
the
apr
technology_13
on
our
component_9
employ
the
requirement_8
connector
and
create
a
custom
embed
technology_15
component_9
constructor
on
the
technology_3
side
the
custom
constructor
be
also
use
to
set
the

connector_data_8
in
the
component_20
above
because
not
all
the

final

the
customizations
make
on
the
technology_15
side
to
tune
our
environment
be
set
the
max
connector_11
and
timeout
requirement_10
to
align
with
the
technology_1
httpd
web
component_9
and
prevent
excessive
load
on
the
technology_15
component_9
instal
apr
and
use
the
requirement_8
ajp
connector
for
i
o
requirement_9
improvement
customize
the
default
technology_3
embed
technology_15
constructor
to
set
the
property
not
externalize
by
the
technology_3
property
component_11
tweak
the
connector_11
and
component_13
parameter
to
establish
number
that
perform
well
during
our
load
test
besides
the
requirement
from
our
requirement_2
to
not
connector_9
the
component_8

this
custom
embed
technology_15
can
be
place
in
the
actual
embed
component_9
connector_20
of
a
project
alternately
we
can
go
further
and
create
a
patch
since
the
technology_3
project
limit
our
ability
to
connector_9
the
default
connector
there
isn’t
much
to
do
at
the
technology_15
side
besides
experimentation
the
coding_keyword_7
focus
should
be
with
the
component_1
that
be
use
it
servlet
capability
a
common
scenario
be
a
bad
performatic
component_1
take
too
long
to
coding_keyword_4
a
connector_data_7
connector_data_9
in
a
bad
experience
for
the
component_10
but
we
can
leverage
several
technology_15
parameter
and
connector
implementation
to
improve
the
way
that
the
component_9
handle
connector_11
technology_1
technology_2
and
technology_3
we
finally
arrive
at
the
component_1
pattern_7
after
tweak
several
knob
on
the
pattern_3
and
servlet
component_9
tune
the
gc
algorithm
the
technology_3
component_11
tie
the
embed
technology_15
component_9
and
the
technology_1
technology_2
connector_21
and
component_21
together
all
of
these
component_21
run
on
the
same
technology_23
virtual
component_12
technology_12
component_7
so
we
decide
to
start
by
tune
the
technology_12
garbage
collector
gc
algorithm
garbage

deserve
an
entire
dedicate
to
it
a
with
the
technology_1
httpd
component_9
tune
there’s
other

on
the
internet
talk
about
this
subject
if
you’re
interest
in
a
deep
dive
into
it
give
it
a
try
use
oracle’s
technology_12
tune
documentation
this
documentation
doesn’t
cover
any
particular
use
requirement_5
but
it
provide
quality_attribute_9
explanation
of
the
connector_data_10
of
each
algorithm
if
not
set
the
technology_12
try
to
tune
the
gc
by
itself
in
a
component_7
connector_22
ergonomics
this
could
work
in
environment
with
a
small
load
but
in
our
scenario
we
decide
to
take
control
of
our
gc
algorithm
and
experiment
with
it
in
the
end
the
g1
be
the
chosen
one
the
decision
be
base
on
the
follow
criterion
it’s
the
algorithm
that
perform
quality_attribute_9
at
our
test
take
into
account
our
scenario
resource
and
architecture
it’s
optimize
to
maximize
the
quality_attribute_10
with
small
pause
during
the
component_1
life
cycle
favor
pattern_2
component_22
that
have
high
quality_attribute_10
requirement
if
you
have
little
or
no
knowledge
about
gc
tune
a
start
point
could
be
red_hat’s
technology_12
configuration
lab
subscription
require
the
lab
give
you
some
option
to
configure
your
gc
that
can
lead
you
into
fine
tune
once
an
algorithm
be
chosen
some
aspect
of
the
gc
that
you
should
take
care
of
too
many
“full
gcs”
during
component_1
load
to
perform
a
full
gc
the
gc
start
an
connector_22
“stop
the

that
be
a
pause
in
every
run
component_13
to
free
up
memory
during
those
pause
nothing
be
component_7
at
the
technology_12
which
might
increase
the
component_1
response_time
long
pause
even
if
the
gc
be
not
perform
too
many
“stop

it’s
important
to
take
a
look
into
the
pause
time
quality_attribute_2
on
your
requirement
pause
of

second
or
more
could
impact
your

there
be
configuration
to
try
to

a
quality_attribute_9
technology_19
to
analyse
the

the
last
one
can
give
you
a
high

gc
analysis
base
on
your
requirement_1
and
could
be
a
quality_attribute_9
start
point
to
understand
the
behavior
of
your
gc
besides
the
gc
algorithm
chosen
there
be
two
configuration
that
you
should
always
set
in
any

configuration
gc

to
examine
your
gc
behavior
during
the

you
must
enable
the

requirement_1
you
should
not
worry
since
you
shouldn’t

the

will
come
in
handy
during

this

this
could
lead
to

during

the
