let’s

here’s
an
example
of
how
a

connector_1
would
look
–
in
this
requirement_8
the
connector_data_1
we
be
look
at

a

a

will
generate
massive

this

be
very
difficult

with
a
the
lack

and
connector_data_4
make
it
difficult
to
query
with
technology_11
base
analytic
technology_3
instead
connector_data_1
need
to
be
component_10

before

such

component_10
connector_data_1

must
account
for
the
unique

of

be
a
complex
challenge
rarely
solve
with

–
hence
the
need
to
“architect”
a

consist
of
multiple
build
block
part
of
the
think
behind
upsolver
be
that
many
of

can
be
combine

replace
with
declarative

within

and
we

why

with

dip
their

find
a

and
with
the
increasing
appetite
for

the
need
to
adopt

be
quickly

mainstream
while

at
