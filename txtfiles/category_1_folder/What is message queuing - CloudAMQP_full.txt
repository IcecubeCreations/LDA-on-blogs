connector_data_1
pattern_1
allow
component_2
to
connector_2
by
connector_3
connector_data_2
to
each
other
the
connector_data_1
component_1
provide
temporary
connector_data_1
storage
when
the
destination
component_3
be
busy
or
not
connector_4
this
explain
connector_data_1
component_1
what
it
be
how
to
use
it
and
the
benefit
of
use
a
connector_data_1
component_1
in
an
architecture
a
component_1
be
a
line
of
thing
wait
to
be
handle
start
at
the
begin
of
the
line
and
component_4
it
in
sequential
order
a
connector_data_1
component_1
be
a
component_1
of
connector_data_2
connector_5
between
component_5
it
include
a
sequence
of
work
connector_data_3
that
be
wait
to
be
component_4
a
connector_data_1
be
the
connector_data_4
transport
between
the
sender
and
the
receiver
component_5
it
s
essentially
a
byte
with
some

at
the
top
an
example
of
a
connector_data_1
could
be
something
that
tell
one
component_6
to
start
component_4
a
connector_data_5
it
could
contain
connector_data_6
about
a
finish
connector_data_5
or
be
a
plain
connector_data_1
the
basic
architecture
of
a
connector_data_1
component_1
be
quality_attribute_1
there
be
component_7
component_2
connector_6
component_8
that
create
connector_data_2
and
connector_7
them
to
the
connector_data_1
component_1
another
component_5
connector_6
a
component_9
connector_8
to
the
component_1
and
connector_9
the
connector_data_2
to
be
component_4
connector_data_2
place
onto
the
component_1
be
component_10
until
the
component_9
connector_10
them
connector_data_1
component_11
a
connector_data_1
component_1
provide
an
pattern_2
connector_11
technology_2
which
be
a
component_6
that
put
a
connector_data_1
onto
a
connector_data_1
component_1
and
do
not
require
an
immediate
connector_12
to
continue
component_4
be
probably
the
best
example
of
pattern_2
connector_13
when
an
be
connector_14
the
sender
continue
to
component_4
other
thing
without
need
an
immediate
connector_12
from
the
receiver
this
way
of
handle
connector_data_2
decouple
the
component_12
from
the
component_9
so
that
they
do
not
need
to
connector_15
with
the
connector_data_1
component_1
at
the
same
time
decouple
and
quality_attribute_2
decouple
describe
how
much
one
piece
of
a
component_6
rely
on
another
piece
of
the
component_6
decouple
be
the
component_4
of
separate
so
that
they
be
more
self
contain
a
decouple
component_6
be
achieve
when
two
or
more
component_13
be
able
to
connector_2
without
be
connector_4
the
component_13
can
remain
completely
autonomous
and
unaware
of
other

decouple
be
often
a
sign
of
a
component_14
component_6
that
be
well
pattern_3
because
it
be
easy
to
maintain
if
one
component_4
in
a
decouple
component_6
fail
to
component_4
connector_data_2
from
the
component_1
other
connector_data_2
can
still
be

to
the
component_1
and
be
component_4
when
the
component_6
have
recover
you
can
also
use
a
connector_data_1
component_1
to
delay
component_4
for
example
a
component_12

connector_data_2
to
a
component_1
at
the
appoint
time
the
component_15
start
and
component_4
the
connector_data_2
in
the
component_1
a
component_1
connector_data_1
can
be
component_10
and
connector_16
and
the
connector_data_1
can
be
redelivered
until
it
be
component_4
instead
of
build
one
large
component_5
it
be
beneficial
to
decouple
different
part
of
your
component_5
and
connector_2
between
them
asynchronously
use
connector_data_1
component_1
this
allow
for
different
part
of
the
component_5
to
quality_attribute_3
independently
be
connector_17
in
different
technology_3
and
or
be
maintain
by
separate
development
team
a
connector_data_1
component_1
will
keep
the
component_16
in
your
component_5
separate
and
independent
of
each
other
the
first
component_4
will
never
need
to
invoke
another
component_4
connector_data_7
to
another
component_4
or
follow
the
component_4
flow
of
the
other
component_4
it
can
put
the
connector_data_1
in
the
component_1
and
then
continue
component_4
the
other
component_16
can
also
handle
their
work
independently
take
the
connector_data_2
from
the
component_1
when
they
be
able
to
component_4
them
this
way
of
handle
connector_data_2
create
a
component_6
that
be
easy
to
maintain
and
quality_attribute_4
connector_data_1
pattern_1
a
quality_attribute_1
use
requirement_2
imagine
that
you
have
a
web
component_17
that
connector_18
many
connector_data_8
every
second
where
no
connector_data_9
can
connector_1
lose
and
all
connector_data_8
need
to
be
component_4
by
a
that
have
a
high
quality_attribute_5
in
other
word
the
web
component_17
always
have
to
be
highly
quality_attribute_6
and
ready
to
connector_19
a
connector_data_9
instead
of
be
lock
by
the
component_4
of
previously
connector_20
connector_data_9
in
this
requirement_2
place
a
component_1
between
the
web
component_17
and
the
component_4
component_17
be
ideal
the
web
component_17
can
put
the
start
component_4
connector_data_1
on
a
component_1
and
the
other
component_4
can
take
and
handle
connector_data_2
in
order
the
two
component_16
be
decouple
from
each
other
and
do
not
need
to
wait
if
you
have
a
lot
of
connector_data_8
come
in
a
short
amount
of
time
the
component_4
component_6
will
be
able
to
component_4
them
all
the
component_1
will
persist
with
the
connector_data_8
even
if
their
number
grow
then
imagine
that
the
requirement_3
and
workload
be
grow
and
the
component_6
need
to
be
quality_attribute_4
up
all
that
need
to
be
do
be
to
more
component_15
to
work
off
the
component_11
fast
technology_4
if
you
do
start
to
consider
a
component_1
