approach
you

technique
to

when
design
the
component_1
avoid
functional
decomposition
functional
decomposition
decompose
a
component_1
into
it
build
block
base
on
the
requirement_1
of
the
component_1
for
example
if
the
component_1
need
to
perform
a
set
of
such
a
invoice
bill
and
ship
you
end
up
with
the
invoice
component_6
the
bill
component_6
and
the
ship
component_6
problem
with
functional
decomposition
the
problem
with
functional
decomposition
be
many
and
acute
at
the
very
least
functional
decomposition
couple
component_5
to
the
requirement
because
the
component_5
be
a
pattern_1
of
the
requirement
any
connector_7
in
the
require
requirement_1
impose
a
connector_7
on
the
functional
component_6
such
connector_8
be
inevitable
over
time
and
impose
a
painful
future
connector_7
to
your
component_1
by
require
a
decomposition
after
the
fact
to
reflect
the
requirement
in
addition
to
costly
connector_8
to
the
component_1
functional
decomposition
preclude
quality_attribute_2
and
lead
to
overly
complex
component_7
and
component_8
preclude
quality_attribute_2
consider
a
quality_attribute_3
functionally
decompose
component_1
that
u
three
component_5
a
b
and
technology_6
which
be
connector_5
in
the
order
of
a
then
b
then
technology_6
because
functional
decomposition
be
also
decomposition
base
on
time
connector_data_4
a
and
then
connector_data_4
b
it
effectively
preclude
individual
quality_attribute_2
of
component_6
suppose
another
component_1
also
need
a
b
component_6
such
a
bill
build
into
the
technology_7
of
b
be
the
notion
that
it
be
connector_5
after
an
a
and
before
a
technology_8
component_6
such
a
first
invoice
and
only
then
bill
against
an

and
finally
ship
any
attempt
to
lift
the
b
component_6
from
the
first
component_1
and
drop
it
in
the
second
component_1
will
fail
because
in
the
second
component_1
no
one
be
do
a
before
it
and
technology_8
after
it
when
you
lift
the
b
component_6
the
a
and
the
technology_8
component_5
be
hang
off
it
b
be
not
an
independent
quality_attribute_4
component_6
at
all‚Äîa
b
and
technology_8
be
a
clique
of
tightly
couple
component_6
too
many
or
too
big
one
way
of
perform
functional
decomposition
be
to
have
a
many
component_5
a
there
be
variation
of
the
requirement_1
this
decomposition
lead
to
an
explosion
of
component_6
since
a
decently
size
component_1
have
hundred
of
requirement_1
not
only
do
you
have
too
many
component_6
but
these
component_5
often
duplicate
a
lot
of
the
common
requirement_1
each
customize
to
their
requirement_2
the
explosion
of
component_5
inflict
a
disproportional
cost
in
requirement_3
and
test
and
increase
overall
complexity
another
functional
decomposition
approach
be
to
lump
all
possible
way
of
perform
the
into
mega
component_6
this
lead
to
bloat
in
the
size
of
the
component_6
make
them
overly
complex

impossible
to
maintain
such

monolith

grind
for
all
relate
variation
of
the
original
requirement_1
with
intricate
relationship
inside

between
the

therefore
tend
to
make
component_5
either
too
big

functional

often
lead
to
flatten
of
the

since
each
component_6

someone
must

so
on

engineer
discover
that
it
be
a
bad
idea
to
include
requirement_4
component_10
with
the
component_8
yet
when
design
a

figure
you
be
force
to
pollute
the
component_8
with
the
requirement_4
component_10
of

order

duration
of

you
be
destine
to
duplicate

across
the

make
quality_attribute_6
of
all
those
component_9
wasteful
and
expensive
a
the
requirement_1
connector_7
you
now
be
force
to
keep
up
with
that
connector_7
across
multiple
component_8
since
all
of
them
will
be
affect
often
once
that
be
the
requirement_2
developer
try
to
avoid
any
connector_8
to
the
requirement_1
of
the
component_5
because
of
the
cascade
effect
it
will
have
on
the
component_8
with
the
multiplicity
of
component_8
each
with
it
own
version
of
the
sequence
quality_attribute_7
to
it
need
it
become
even
more
challenge
to
connector_7
or
interchange
component_6
thus
preclude
quality_attribute_2
of
the
same
behavior
across
the
component_8
effectively
you
end
up
maintain
multiple
complex
component_1
try
to
keep
them
all
in
pattern_6
ultimately
this
lead
to
both
stifle
of
innovation
and
increase
time
to

the

once
for

and
so

you
will
need
to
connector_7

the
a

then
connector_data_6

the
problem
now
be
that
the
functional

be
couple
to
each

and
to
the
order
of
the
functional
connector_data_4
for
example
you
can
connector_data_4
the

component_6
only
after

but
before
the
ship
component_6
in
the

of

build
into
the
a
component_6
be
the
knowledge
that
it
need
to
connector_data_4
the
b
component_6
the
b
component_6
can
be
connector_5
only
after
the
a
component_6
and
before
the
technology_8
component_6
a
connector_7
in
the
require
order
of
the
connector_data_6
be
likely
to
affect
all
component_5
up
and
down
the
chain
because
their
implementation
will
have
to
connector_7
to
reflect
the
require
order
but
figure
do
not
reveal
the
full
picture
the
b
component_6
of
figure
be
drastically
different
from
that
of
figure
the
original
b
component_6
perform
only
the
b
requirement_1
the
b
component_6
in
figure
must
be
aware
of
the
technology_8
component_6
and
the
b
contract
must
contain
the
parameter
that
will
be
require
by
the
technology_8
component_6
to
perform
it
requirement_1
these
detail
be
the
responsibility
of
the
component_8
in
figure
the
problem
be
compound
by
the
a
component_6
which
must
now
accommodate
in
it
component_6
contract
the
parameter
require
for
connector_10
the
b
and
the
technology_8
component_5
for
them
to
perform
their
respective
requirement_4
requirement_1
any
connector_7
to
the

and
technology_8
requirement_1
be
reflect
in
a
connector_7
to
the
implementation
of
the
a
component_6
which
be
now
couple
to
them
this
kind
of
bloat
and
couple
be
depict
in
figure
figure
chain
requirement_1
lead
to
bloat
component_6
sadly
even
figure
do
not
tell
the
whole
truth
suppose
the
a
component_6
perform
the
a
requirement_1
successfully
and
then
proceed
to
connector_10
the
b
component_6
to
perform
the
b
requirement_1
the
b
component_6
however
encounter
an
error
and
fail
to
connector_11
properly
if
a
connector_5
b
synchronously
then
a
must
be
intimately
aware
of
the
internal
component_10
and
state
of
b
in
order
to
recover
it
error
this
mean
the
b
requirement_1
must
also
reside
in
the
a
component_6
if
a
connector_5
b
asynchronously
then
the
b
component_6
must
now
somehow
reach
back
to
the
a
component_6
and
undo
the
a
requirement_1
or
contain
the
rollback
of
a
within
itself
in
other
word
the
a
requirement_1
also
reside
in
the
b
component_6
this
create
tight
couple
between
the
b
component_6
and
the
a
component_6
and
bloat
the
b
component_6
with
the
need
to
compensate
for
the
success
of
the
a
component_6
this
situation
be
show
in
figure
figure
additional
bloat
and
couple
due
to
compensation
the
issue
be
compound
in
the
technology_8
component_6
what
if
both
the
a
and
b
requirement_1
succeed
and
complete
but
the
technology_8
component_6
fail
to
perform
it
requirement_4
the
technology_8
component_6
must
reach
back
to
both
the
b
and
the
a
component_5
to
undo
their
this
create
far
more
bloat
in
the
technology_8
component_6
and
couple
it
to
the

component_6
give
the

will
it
take
to
replace
the

with
a

component_6
that
perform

than

what
will
be
the
adverse
effect
on
the

component_6
again
what
degree
of

exist
in

you
to
simply
connector_data_8
the
require
requirement_1
and
then
create
a
component_3
in
your
architecture
for
each
functional
decomposition
and
it
kin
the
domain
decomposition
discus
late
be
how
most
component_7
be
design
most
people
choose
functional
decomposition
naturally
and
it
be
likely
what
your
component_15
science
professor
show
you
in
school
the
prevalence
of
functional
decomposition
in
poorly
design
component_7
make
a
near
perfect
indicator
of
something
to
avoid
at
all
cost
you
must
resist
the
temptation
of
functional
decomposition
nature
of
the
universe
tanstaafl
you
can
prove
that
functional
decomposition
be
preclude
from
ever
work
without
use
a
single
engineering
argument
the
proof
have
to
do
with
the
very
nature
of
the
universe
specifically
the
first
law
of
thermodynamics
strip
away
the
math
the
first
law
of
thermodynamics
simply
state
that
you
cannot
requirement_8
without
sweating
a
colloquial
way
of
say
the
same
be
‚Äúthere
ain‚Äôt
no
such
thing
a
a
free
lunch
‚Äù
design
by
it
very
nature
be
a
high
requirement_8
activity
you
be
connector_12
this
book
instead
of
yet
another
programming
book
because
you
requirement_8
design
or
put
differently
you
think
design
requirement_8
or
even
a
lot
of
requirement_8
the
problem
with
functional
decomposition
be
that
it
endeavor
to
cheat
the
first
law
of
thermodynamics
the
outcome
of
a
functional
decomposition
namely
component_1
design
should
be
a
high
requirement_8
activity
however
functional
decomposition
be
easy
and
straightforward
give
a
set
of
requirement
that
connector_data_4
for
perform
the
a
b
and
technology_8
requirement_1
you
decompose
into
the
a
b
and
technology_8
component_6
‚Äúno
sweat
‚Äù
you
say
‚Äúfunctional
decomposition
be
so
easy
that
a
technology_9
could
do
it
‚Äù
however
precisely
because
it
be
a
fast
easy
mechanistic
and
straightforward
design
it
also
manifest
a
contradiction
to
the
first
law
of
thermodynamics
since
you
cannot
requirement_8
without
effort
the
very
attribute
that
make
functional
decomposition
so
appeal
be
those
that
preclude
functional
decomposition
from
requirement_8
the
anti
design
effort
it
will
be
an
uphill
struggle
to
convince
colleague
and
manager
to
do
anything
other
than
functional
decomposition
‚Äúwe
have
always
do
it
that
way
‚Äù
they
will
say
there
be
two
way
to
counter
that
argument
the
first
be
connector_data_9
‚Äúand
how
many
time
have
we
meet
the
deadline
or
the
budget
to
which
we
connector_13
what
be
our
quality
and
complexity
how
easy
be
it
to
maintain
the
component_1
‚Äù
the
second
be
to
perform
an
anti
design
effort
inform
the
team
that
you
be
conduct
a
design
contest
for
the
next
generation
component_1
split
the
team
into
half
each
in
a
separate
conference
room
ask
the
first
half
to
produce
the
best
design
for
the
component_1
ask
the
second
half
to
produce
the
worst
possible
design
a
design
that
will
maximize
your
inability
to
extend
and
maintain
the
component_1
a
design
that
will
disallow
quality_attribute_2
and
so
on
them
work
on
it
for
one
afternoon
and
then
bring
them
together
when
you
compare
the
connector_data_3
you
will
usually
see
they
have
produce
the
same
design
the
label
on
the
component_4
differ
but
the
essence
of
the
design
will
be
the
same
only
now
confess
that
they
be
not
work
on
the
same
problem
and
discus
the
implication
perhaps
a
different
approach
be
connector_5
for
this
time
example
functional
house
the
fact
you
should
never
design
use
functional

be
a
universal
observation
that
have
nothing
to
do
with

consider
build
a
house
functionally
a
if
it
be
a

you
start
by
connector_data_8
all
the
require

of
the
house
such
a
cook
play

so
on
you
then
create
an
actual

in
the
architecture
for
each
requirement_1
a
show
in
figure
figure
functional

of
a
house
while
figure
be
already
preposterous
the
true
insanity
become
evident
only
when
it
be
time
to
build
this
house
you
start
with
a
clean
plot
of
land
and
build
cook
cook
you
take
a
microwave
oven
out
of
it
component_16
and
put
it
aside
pour
a
small
concrete
pad
build
a
wood
frame
on
the
pad
cover
it
with
countertop
and
place
the
microwave
on
it
build
a
small
pantry
for
the
microwave
and
hammer
a
tiny
roof
over
it
connector_14
the
microwave
to
the
power
grid
‚Äúwe
have

‚Äù
you
announce
to
the

and
requirement_9
but
be

really
do
can
cook

do
this
way
where
be
you
serve
the

connector_15
the
leftover

dispose

what
about

over
the
gas
stove
what
will
it
take
to
duplicate
this
feat
for

over
the
stove
what
degree
of
quality_attribute_2
can
you
have
between
the
two
separate
way
of
express
the

can
you

easily
what
about

what
do
it
take

all
of
this
mess
be
not
even
the
begin
because
it
all
quality_attribute_9
on
the
type
of

you
perform
you
need
to
build
separate

requirement_1
perhaps
if

involve
multiple

and
differ
by

example
if
you
be

you
end
up
with

component_6
each

you
end
up
with
massive

component_6
that
have
it
all
will
you
ever
build
a
house
that
if
not
why
design
and
build
a

that
way
when
to
use
functional

the
derision
in
these
component_2
do
not
mean
functional

be
a
bad
idea
functional

have
a
place‚Äîit
be
a
decent
requirement
discovery
technique
it
help
architect
or
technology_11
manager
discover
hide
or
imply
area
of
requirement_1
start
at
the
top
even
with
vague
functional
requirement
you
can
drive
functional

to
a
very
fine
level
uncovering
requirement
and
their
relationship
arrange
the
requirement
in
a
tree
manner
and
identify
pattern_11
or
mutually
exclusive
requirement_1
extend
functional

into
a
design
however
be
deadly
there
should
never
be
direct
connector_data_10
between
the
requirement
and
the
design
avoid
domain
decomposition
the
house
design
in
figure
be
obviously
absurd
in
your
house
you
likely
do
the
cook
in
the
kitchen
so
an
alternative
decomposition
of
the
house
be
show
in
figure
this
form
of
decomposition
be
connector_5
domain
decomposition
decompose
a
component_1
into
build
block
base
on
the
requirement_4
domain
such
a
sale
engineering
accounting
and
ship
sadly
domain
decomposition
such
a
figure
show
be
even
bad
than
the
functional
decomposition
of
figure
the
reason
domain
decomposition
do
not
work
be
that
it
be
still
functional
decomposition
in
disguise
kitchen
be
where
you
do
the
cook
bedroom
be
where
you
do
the
sleeping
garage
be
where
you
do
the
parking
and
so
on
figure
domain
decomposition
of
a
house
in
fact
every
one
of
the
functional
area
of
figure
can
be
connector_data_10
to
domain
in
figure
which
present
severe
problem
while
each
bedroom
be
unique
you
must
duplicate
the
requirement_1
of
sleeping
in
all
of
them
further
duplication
occur
when
sleeping
in
front
of
the
tv
in
the
live

or
when
entertain
guest
in
the
kitchen
a
almost
all
house
party
end
up
in
the
kitchen
each
domain
often
devolve
into
an
ugly
connector_16
bag
of
requirement_1
increasing
the
internal
complexity
of
the
domain
the
increase
inner
complexity
cause
you
to
avoid
the
pain
of
cross
domain
connector_17
and
connector_18
across
domain
be
typically
reduce
to
quality_attribute_3
state
connector_8
crud
rather
than
action
connector_19
require
behavior
connector_20
involve
all
domain
compose
more
complex
behavior
across
domain
be
very
difficult
some
requirement_1
be
simply
impossible
in
such
domain
decomposition
for
example
in
the
house
in
figure
where
would
you
perform
cook
that
cannot
take
place
in
the
kitchen
e
g
a
barbecue
build
a
domain
house
a
with
the
pure
functional
approach
the
real
problem
with
domain
decomposition
become
evident
during
construction
imagine
build
a
house
along
the
decomposition
of
figure
you
start
with
a
clean
plot
of
land
you
dig
a
trench
for
the
foundation
for
the
kitchen
pour
concrete
for
the
foundation
for
the
kitchen
and
bolt
in
the
concrete
you
then
erect
the
kitchen
wall
all
have
to
be
exterior
wall
bolt
them
to
the
foundation
run
electrical
wire
and
plumb
in
the
wall
connector_14
the

to
the
water
power
and
gas
supply
connector_14
the
kitchen
to
the
sewer
discharge
heat
and
cool
duct
and
vent
connector_14
the
kitchen
to
a
furnace
water
power
and
gas
meter
build
a
roof
over
the
kitchen
screw
drywall
on
the
inside
hang
cabinet
coat
the
outside
wall
all
wall
with
stucco
and
paint
it
you
announce
to
the
requirement_9
that
the
kitchen
be
do
and
that
milestone
be
meet
then
you
move
on
to
the
bedroom
you
first
bust
the
stucco
off
the
kitchen
wall
to
connector_21
the
bolt
connector_14
the
wall
to
the
foundation
and
unbolt
the
kitchen
from
the
foundation
you
disconnect
the
kitchen
from
the
power
supply
gas
supply
water
supply
and
sewer
discharge
and
then
use
expensive
hydraulic
jack
to
lift
the
kitchen
while
suspend
the
kitchen
in
midair
you
shift
it
to
the
side
so
that
you
can
demolish
the
foundation
for
the
kitchen
with
jackhammer
haul
the
debris
away
and
pay
expensive
connector_data_11
fee
now
you
can
dig
a
trench
that
will
contain
a
continuous
foundation
for
the
bedroom
and
the
kitchen
you
pour
concrete
into
the
trench
to
cast
the
foundation
and
the
bolt
hopefully
at
exactly
the
same
spot
a
before
next
you
very
carefully
lower
the
kitchen
back
on
top
of
the
foundation
make
sure
all
the
bolt
hole
align
this
be
next
to
impossible
you
erect
wall
for
the
bedroom
you
temporarily
remove
the
cabinet
from
the
kitchen
wall
remove
the
drywall
to
connector_21
the
inner
electrical
wire
pip
and
duct
and
connector_14
the
duct
plumb
and
wire
to
those
of
the
bedroom
you
drywall
in
the
kitchen
and
the
bedroom
rehang
the
kitchen
cabinet
and
closet
in
the
bedroom
you
knock
down
any
remain
stucco
from
the
wall
of
the
kitchen
so
that
you
can
apply
continuous
crack
free
stucco
on
the
outside
wall
you
must
convert
several
of
the
previous
outside
wall
of
the
kitchen
to
internal
wall
now
with
implication
on
stucco
insulation
paint
and
so
on
you
remove
the
roof
of
the
kitchen
and
build
a
continuous
roof
over
the
bedroom
and
the
kitchen
you
announce
to
the
requirement_9
that
milestone
be
meet
and
bedroom
be
do
the
fact
that
you
have
to
rebuild
the
kitchen
be
not
disclose
the
fact
that
build
the
kitchen
the
second
time
around
be
much
more
expensive
and
riskier
than
the
first
time
be
also
undisclosed
what
will
it
take
to
another
bedroom
to
this
house
how
many
time
will
you
end
up
build
and
demolish
the
kitchen
how
many
time
can
you
actually
rebuild
the
kitchen
before
it
crumble
into
a
shift
pile
of
useless
debris
be
the
kitchen
really
do
when
you
announce
it
so
rework
penalty
aside
what
degree
of
quality_attribute_2
be
there
between
the
various
part
of
the
house
how
much
more
expensive
be
build
a
house
this
way
why
would
it
make
sense
to
build
a
component_1
this
way
faulty
motivation
the
motivation
for
functional
or
domain
decomposition
be
that
the
requirement_4
or
the
requirement_9
want
it
feature
a
soon
a
possible
the
problem
be
that
you
can
never
quality_attribute_10
a
single
feature
in
isolation
there
be
no
requirement_4
requirement_8
in
bill
independent
from
invoice
and
ship
the
situation
be
even
bad
when
component_17
component_7
be
involve
rarely
do
developer
connector_3
the
privilege
of
a
completely
green
component_1
most
likely
there
be
an
exist
decay
component_1
that
be
design
functionally
whose
inflexibility
and
quality_attribute_6
cost
justify
the
component_1
suppose
your
requirement_4
have
three
requirement_1
a
b
and
technology_6
run
in
a
component_17
component_1
when
build
a
component_1
to
replace
the
old
you
decide
to
build
and
more
important
quality_attribute_10
the
a
requirement_1
first
to
satisfy
the
requirement_9
and
manager
who
wish
to
see
requirement_8
early
and
often
the
problem
be
that
the
requirement_4
have
no
use
for
a
on
it
own
the
requirement_4
need
b
and
technology_8
a
well
perform
a
in
the
component_1
and
b
and
technology_8
in
the
old
component_1
will
not
work
because
the
old
component_1
do
not
about
the
component_1
and
cannot
connector_11
b
and
technology_6
do
a
in
both
the
old
component_1
and
the
component_1
no
requirement_8
and
even
have
negative
requirement_8
due
to
the
repeat
work
so
component_18
be
likely
to
revolt
the
only
solution
be
to
somehow
reconcile
the
old
and
the
component_1
the
reconciliation
typically
far
eclipse
in
complexity
the
challenge
of
the
original
underlie
requirement_4
problem
so
developer
end
up
solve
a
far
more
complex
problem
to
use
the
house
analogy
again
what
would
it
be
to
live
in
a
cramp
old
house
while
build
a
house
on
the
other
side
of
town
accord
to
figure
or
figure
suppose
you
be
build
cook
or
the
kitchen
in
the
house
while
continue
to
live
in
the
old
house
every
time
you
be
hungry
you
have
to
drive
to
the
house
and
come
back
you
would
not
connector_22
it
with
your
house
so
you
should
not
inflict
this
kind
of
abuse
on
your
requirement_9
quality_attribute_11
and
design
a
crucial
flaw
of
both
functional
and
domain
decomposition
have
to
do
with
test
with
such
design
the
level
of
couple
and
complexity
be
so
high
that
the
only
kind
of
test
developer
can
do
be
unit
test
however
that
do
not
make
unit
test
important
and
it
be
merely
another
example
of
the
streetlight
effect1
i
e
search
for
something
where
it
be
easy
to
look
technology_12
en
wikipedia
wiki
streetlight_effect
the
sad
reality
be
that
unit
test
be
borderline
useless
while
unit
test
be
an
essential
part
of
test
it
cannot
really
test
a
component_1
consider
a
jumbo
technology_13
that
have
numerous
internal
component_4
pump
actuator
servo
gear
turbine
etc
now
suppose
all
component_4
have
independently
pass
unit
test
perfectly
but
that
be
the
only
test
that
take
place
before
the
component_4
be
assemble
into
an
aircraft
would
you
dare
board
that
airplane
the
reason
unit
test
be
so
marginal
be
that
in
any
complex
component_1
the
defect
be
not
go
to
be
in
any
of
the
unit
but
rather
be
the
connector_data_3
of
the
connector_23
between
the
unit
this
be
why
you
instinctively
that
while
each
component_3
in
the
jumbo
technology_13
example
work
the
aggregate
could
be
horribly
wrong
bad
even
if
the
complex
component_1
be
at
a
perfect
state
of
impeccable
quality
connector_7
a
single
unit
test
component_3
could
break
some
other
unit
s
rely
on
an
old
behavior
you
must
repeat
test
of
all
unit
when
connector_7
a
single
unit
even
then
it
would
be
meaningless
because
the
connector_7
to
one
of
the
component_4
could
affect
some
connector_23
between
other
component_4
or
a
subsystem
which
no
unit
test
could
discover
the
only
way
to
verify
connector_7
be
full
regression
test
of
the
component_1
it
subsystem
it
component_4
and
connector_23
and
finally
it
unit
if
a
a
connector_data_3
of
your
connector_7
other
unit
need
to
connector_7
the
effect
on
regression
test
be
nonlinear
the
inefficacy
of
unit
test
be
not
a
observation
and
have
be
demonstrate
across
thousand
of
well
measure
component_1
in
theory
you
could
perform
regression
test
even
on
a
functionally
decompose
component_1
in
practice
the
complexity
of
that
connector_data_12
would
set
the
bar
very
high
the
sheer
number
of
the
functional
component_4
would
make
test
all
the
connector_23
impractical
the
very
large
component_5
would
be
internally
so
complex
that
no
one
could
effectively
devise
a
comprehensive
strategy
that
test
all
path
through
such
component_6
with
functional
decomposition
most
developer
give
up
and
perform
quality_attribute_3
unit
test
therefore
by
preclude
regression
test
functional
decomposition
make
the
entire
component_1
untestable
and
untestable
component_7
be
always
rife
with
defect
physical
versus
component_7
in
this
book
i
resort
to
use
example
from
the
physical
world
such
a
house
to
demonstrate
universal
design
principle
a
common
sentiment
in
the
requirement_10
be
that
you
cannot
extrapolate
from
the
design
of
such
physical
component_19
to
that
design
and
construction
be
somehow
exempt
from
the
design
or
component_20
limitation
of
physical
component_1
or
that
be
too
different
from
physical
component_1
after
all
in
you
can
paint
a
house
first
and
then
build
the
wall
to
fit
the
paint
in
you
do
not
have
cost
of
quality_attribute_1
such
a
technology_14
and
brick
i
find
that
not
only
can
the
requirement_10
borrow
from
the
physical
world
experience
and
best
practice
it
must
do
so
contrary
to
intuition
require
design
even
more
than
physical
component_7
do
the
reason
be
quality_attribute_3
complexity
the
complexity
of
physical
component_7
such
a
typical
house
be
cap
by
physical
constraint
you
cannot
have
a
poorly
design
house
with
hundred
of
interconnect
corridor
and
room
the
wall
will
either
weigh
too
much
have
too
many
opening
be
too
thin
have
door
too
small
or
cost
too
much
to
assemble
you
cannot
use
too
much
build
material
because
the
house
will
implode
or
you
will
not
have
the
cash
flow
to
buy
them
or
a
place
to
component_21
the
extra
material
on
without
such
natural
physical
restraint
complexity
in
component_7
can
connector_3
quickly
out
of
control
the
only
way
to
rein
in
that
complexity
be
to
apply
quality_attribute_1
engineering
of
which
design
and
component_20
be
paramount
well
design
component_7
be
very
much
physical
component_19
and
be
build
very
much
the
same
way
they
be
well
design
component_22
functional
or
domain
decomposition
make
no
sense
when
design
and
build
either
a
house
or
a
component_1
all
complex
component_19
physical
or
not
connector_2
the
same
abstract
attribute
from
the
design
decision
tree
to
the
project
critical
path
of
connector_20
all
composite
component_7
should
be
design
to
be
quality_attribute_12
quality_attribute_13
quality_attribute_4
quality_attribute_14
and
of
high
quality
this
be
true
for
a
house
a
component_22
part
or
a
component_1
these
be
practical
engineering
attribute
and
the
only
way
to
obtain
and
maintain
them
be
to
use
universal
engineering
practice
that
say
there
be
a
fundamental
difference
between
a
physical
component_1
and
a
component_1
visibility
anyone
who
try
to
build
a
house
a
in
figure
or
figure
will
be
fire
on
the
spot
such
a
person
be
clearly
insane
and
the
horrendous
waste
of
build
material
time
and
money
a
well
a
the
risk
of
injury
would
be
plain
for
everyone
to
see
the
problem
with
component_7
be
that
while
there
be
enormous
waste
that
waste
be
hide
in
dust
and
debris
be
replace
by
waste
career
prospect
energy
and
youth
yet
no
one
ever
see
or
care
about
this
hide
waste
and
the
insanity
be
not
only
permit
but
encourage
a
if
the
inmate
have
take
over
the
asylum
correct
design
allow
you
to
break
free
and
restore
control
by
eliminate
the
conceal
waste
this
be
even
more
the
requirement_2
with
project
design
a
the
second
part
of
this
book
show
example
functional
requirement_11
component_1
instead
of
a
house
consider
the
follow
simplify
requirement
for
a
requirement_6
requirement_11
component_1
for
a
financial
requirement_12
the
component_1
should
enable
in
house
trader
to
‚Äì
buy
and
sell
requirement_6
‚Äì
schedule
requirement_11
‚Äì
issue
report
‚Äì
analyze
the
requirement_11
the
component_18
of
the
component_1
utilize
a
browser
to
connector_14
to
the
component_1
and
manage
connector_24
component_23
complete
a
form
and
submit
the
connector_data_13
after
a
requirement_11
report
or
analysis
connector_data_13
the
component_1
connector_25
an
to
the
component_18
confirm
their
connector_data_13
or
contain
the
connector_data_3
the
connector_data_14
should
be
component_21
in
a
local
component_24
a
straightforward
functional
decomposition
would
yield
the
design
of
figure
figure
functional
requirement_11
component_1
each
of
the
functional
requirement
be
express
in
a
respective
component_3
of
the
architecture
figure
represent
a
common
design
to
which
many
novice
developer
would
gravitate
without
hesitation
problem
with
the
functional
requirement_11
component_1
the
flaw
of
such
a
component_1
design
be
many
it
be
very
likely
the
component_8
in
the
present
component_1
be
the
one
that
pattern_2
buy
requirement_6
sell
requirement_6
and
requirement_11
schedule
issue
a
report
with
report
and
so
on
suppose
the
component_11
want
to
fund
purchasing
of
a
certain
number
of
requirement_6
by
sell
other
requirement_6
this
mean
two
order
first
sell
and
then
buy
but
what
should
the
component_8
do
if
by
the
time
these
two
transaction
take
place
the
requirement_13
of
the
requirement_6
sell
have
drop
or
the
requirement_13
of
the
buy
requirement_6
have
rise
so
that
the
sell
cannot
fulfill
the
buy
should
the
component_8
buy
a
many
a
possible
should
it
perhaps
sell
more
requirement_6
than
intend
should
it
dip
into
the
cash
account
behind
the
requirement_11
account
to
supplement
the
order
should
it
abort
the
whole
thing
should
it
ask
for
component_11
assistance
the
exact
resolution
be
immaterial
for
this
discussion
whatever
the
resolution
it
require
requirement_4
component_10
which
now
reside
in
the
component_8
what
will
it
take
to
connector_7
the
component_8
from
a
web
portal
to
a
requirement_5
component_12
would
that
not
mean
duplicate
the
requirement_4
component_10
into
the
requirement_5
component_12
it
be
likely
that
little
of
the
requirement_4
component_10
and
the
effort
invest
in
develop
it
for
the
web
component_8
can
be
salvage
and
quality_attribute_2
in
the
requirement_5
component_8
because
it
be
embed
in
the
web
portal
over
time
the
developer
will
end
up
maintain
several
version
of
the
requirement_4
component_10
in
multiple
component_8
per
the
requirement
buy

the

sell

way
you
connector_data_1
connector_27

connector_28
the

what
if
the

issue
a

the
real

be
go

go
