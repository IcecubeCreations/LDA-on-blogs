be
use
dialogflow
a
my
nlp
component_1
for
my
requirement_1
i
would
to
component_2
the
conversation
to
late
run
some
statistical
component_3
not
in
real
time
for
late
analysis
of
the
connector_data_1
i
be
think
about
connector_1
the
connector_data_1
use
a
lamda
and
technology_1
but
the
implementation
be
le
important
to
me
a
i
would
to
use
the
proper
architecture
to
so
i
can
quality_attribute_1
solve
my
use
requirement_2
component_2
conversation
and
analyze
the
connector_data_1
at
some
point—not
in
realtime
i
be
open
to
any
implementation
and
curious
a
to
what
you
would
suggest
for
this
use
requirement_2
a
i
understand
it
you
suggest
use
a
connector_data_2
pattern_1
a
technology_2
or
technology_3
in
between
my
requirement_3
and
connector_data_1
component_2
to
component_4
all
connector_data_3
first
and
then
load
them
into
the
component_5
in
pattern_2
any
suggestion
would
be
helpful
thanks
again
for
this
a
it
have
make
me
think
of
my
design
a
little
differently
best
joe
