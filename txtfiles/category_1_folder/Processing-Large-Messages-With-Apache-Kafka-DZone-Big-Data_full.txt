in

limitation
of

for

originally

this
do

pressure
on
the

technology_15
large

could

a

can
meet

requirement_7
quality_attribute_9
workarounds
exist
if
you
need

most
requirement_4
offer
t
allow

there
be
noticeable
requirement_6
impact
from
increasing
the
allowable

size
hence
understand
all
alternative
discus
below
before
connector_14
connector_data_1
1mb
through
your
technology_2
cluster
quality_attribute_10
on
your
slas
for
uptime
and
quality_attribute_8
a
separate
technology_2
cluster
should
be
consider
for
component_1
large
connector_data_2
have
say
this
i
have
see
requirement_15
component_1
connector_data_1
far
big
than
10mb
with
technology_2
it
be
valid
to
evaluate
technology_2
for
component_1
large
connector_data_1
instead
of
use
another
technology_14
for
that
often
in
conjunction
with
technology_2
linkedin
talk
a
long
time
ago
about
the
pro
and
con
of
two
different
approach
use
technology_2
only
vs
technology_2
in
conjunction
with
another
connector_data_4
storage
especially
outside
the
requirement_4
most
requirement_16
cannot
simply
use
an
technology_16
connector_data_9
component_13
for
requirement_1
therefore
the
question
come
up
if
one
component_4
technology_2
be
quality_attribute_9
enough
or
if
you
should
invest
in
two
component_7
technology_2
and
external
storage
s
take
a
look
at
the
requirement_8
off
for
use
technology_2
for
large
connector_data_2
technology_2
for
large
connector_data_1
–
alternative
and
requirement_8
off
there
be
no
single
best
solution
the
decision
on
how
to
handle
large
connector_data_1
with
technology_2
quality_attribute_10
on
your
use
requirement_7
slas
and
already
exist
infrastructure
the
follow
three
quality_attribute_11
alternative
exist
to
handle
large
connector_data_1
with
technology_2
reference
base
pattern_8
in
technology_2
and
external
storage
in
line
large
connector_data_2
support
in
technology_2
without
external
storage
in
line
large
connector_data_2
support
and
tiered
storage
in
technology_2
here
be
the
characteristic
and
pro
con
of
each
approach
this
be
an
extension
from
a
linkedin
presentation
in
also
t
underestimate
the
power
of
compression
for
large
connector_data_2
some
big
csv
or
connector_data_10
can
reduce
it
size
significantly
by
set
the
compression
parameter
to
use
gzip
snappy
or
lz4
even
a
1gb
could
be
connector_15
via
technology_2
but
this
be
undoubtedly
not
what
technology_2
be
design
for
in
both
the
component_16
and
the
pattern_7
a
1gb
chunk
of
memory
will
need
to
be
allocate
in
technology_15
for
every
1gb
connector_data_2
hence
in
most
requirement_7
for
really
large
it
be
quality_attribute_9
to
externalize
them
into
an
connector_data_9
component_13
and
use
technology_2
for
the
metadata
you
need
to
define
what
be
a
large
connector_data_2
by
yourself
and
when
to
use
which
of
the
design
pattern_9
discus
in
this
that
s
why
i
be
connector_16
this
up
here
the
follow
section
explore
these
alternative
in
more
detail
before
we
start
s
explain
the
general
concept
of
tiered

for

in
the
above
component_17
many
reader
might
not
be
aware
of
this
yet
tiered

mostly
connector_17
in

fashion
use

the

instead
of

connector_18
old
connector_data_4
be
typically
connector_18
from
the
disk
for
backfill
or
failure
recovery
purpose
and
be
infrequent
in
the
tiered

approach
the

configure
with

be
the

each
of
the
tier
with
remote
tier
enable
the
retention
period
for
the
local
tier
can
be
significantly
reduce
from
day
to
few
hour
the
retention
period
for
remote
tier
can
be
much
long
month
or
even
year
tiered
storage
for
technology_2
allow
quality_attribute_12
storage
independent
of
memory
and
cpu
in
a
technology_2
cluster
enabling
technology_2
to
be
a
long
term
storage
solution
this
also
reduce
the
amount
of
connector_data_4
component_13
locally
on
technology_2
pattern_7
and
hence
the
amount
of
connector_data_4
that

be
pretty
straightforward
this

eip
the
use
requirement_7
be
even
more

a
we

we
combine

in

the

audio
connector_7
work
in

hence
i
will
not
cover
it

a

do
not

but
it
control
the

component_8
big
have
to

i
saw
several

where
large
proprietary
have
to
be
connector_31
between
different
component_9
component_15
similar
to
the

eip
use

you
can
also

i
cover
this
topic
in

and
talk
in
the

or
start
with
this
to

an

about
this
approach
use

requirement_18
natural

nlp
use

continuous
nlp
pipeline
with

technology_2
show

the

design
pattern_9
use

an

i
this
example
because
it
also
solve
the

mismatch
between
the

who
love

large

component_22
in

you
how
to
handle

by
externalize
them
into
an
connector_data_9
component_13
and
only
connector_14
the
metadata
via

in
some
use
requirement_7
this
be
too
much
effort
or
cost
connector_14
large
directly
via

be
possible
and
sometimes
easy
to
connector_32
the
architecture
be
much
quality_attribute_18
and
more
cost
quality_attribute_19
i
already
discus
the
requirement_8
off
above
but
here
be
an
excellent
use
requirement_7
of
connector_14
large
natively
with

attachment
in

here
be
an

in

requirement_11
attachment
image
or
any
other
binary
content
can
be

different

be
possible
for
instance
you
could
use
dedicate

topic
for
handle
large

or
you
put
them
into
your

connector_data_2
with
confluent
schema
registry
the

could
have
an

attachment
or
you
externalize
the
attachment
use
the
claim
connector_25
eip
discus
above
technology_2
requirement_19
handle
of
large
connector_data_1
have
it
use
requirement_7
a
you
in
this
plenty
of
use
requirement_7
exist
for
handle
large
connector_data_1
with
technology_1
technology_2
and
it
ecosystem
technology_2
be
build
for
large
volume
quality_attribute_2
which
be

for
large
connector_data_2
quality_attribute_14
technology_1
technology_2
to
10+
gb
per

in
confluent
requirement_4
be
an
impressive
example
however
not
all
large
connector_data_1
should
be
component_1
with
technology_2
often
you
should
use
the
right
storage
component_4
and
leverage

for
the
pattern_6
the
different
design
pattern_9
and
choose
the

for
each
problem
a
common
scenario
for

requirement_19
component_1
of

be
at

where
other

storage
be
often
not

or
would
increase
the
cost
and
complexity
for
provision
the

what
be
your
