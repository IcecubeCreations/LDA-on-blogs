connector_data_1
the
term
requirement_1
refer
to
a
massive
volume
of
both
pattern_1
and
pattern_3
connector_data_1
that
be
so
large
that
it
be
difficult
to
component_7
use
traditional

and
technique
while
the
presence
of
such

be
not
something

the
past
few
year
have
witness
immense
commercial
investment
in

telecom
requirement_9
be
also
turn
out
to
be
major
proponent
of
the
requirement_1
movement
requirement_1
technology_4
and
in
particular
their
requirement_2
ability
offer
a
multitude
of
benefit
to

operator
which
include

reduce

and
even
the
generation

connector_4
requirement_1
and
requirement_2
have
emerge
a
a
potential
component_2
of
revenue
for
telecom
operator
at
a
time
when
carrier
have
be
feel
the
pressure
to
generate
component_9
of
revenue
one
of
those
component_9
come
from
their
ability
to
mine
the
huge
amount
of
connector_data_1
they
generate
or
have
connector_3
to
in
both
their
requirement_8
base
and
their
requirement_10
the
two
have
emerge
a
the
technology_2
to
help
analyze
and
manage
this
connector_data_2
there
be
now
many
analytical
and
intelligence
technology_2
that
enable
requirement_11
operator
to
understand
requirement_8
and
requirement_10
behavior
connector_5
component_6
technology_3
have
a
rich
connector_4
of
connector_data_1
especially
those
that
offer
telephony
tv
and
internet
component_6
the
triple
play
operator
the
many
component_9
of
connector_data_1
be
an
advantage
for
telecom
requirement_9
but
if
they
want
to
monetize
that
connector_data_1
and
derive
meaningful
actionable
requirement_2
it
could
be
challenge
due
to
the
complexity
of
correlation
prediction
and
the
massive
volume
of
connector_data_1
from
different
component_2
requirement_1
help

behavior
their

while

requirement_1

connector_data_1
among

the

of
