be
increasingly
use
in
the

world
a

work
to
create

that
be

develop
and

requirement_4
technology_12
such

be
rise
to
meet
the
need
to
think
about
and
build
component_7
use
a
piece
by
piece
methodology
that
be
frankly
le
mind
boggle
than
consider
the
whole
of
the
component_1
at
once
today
we’ll
take
a
look
at
pattern_1
the
benefit
of
use
this
capability
and
a
few
example
tip
find
component_1
error

instantly
with

insight
what
be
pattern_1
pattern_1
be
an
architectural
style
that
develop
a
single
component_1
a
a
set
of
small
component_6
each
component_6
run
in
it
own
component_8
the
component_5
connector_1
with
component_9
and
often
each
other
use
lightweight
technology_14
often
over
pattern_3
or
technology_15
pattern_1
can
be
think
of
a
a
form
of
pattern_4
architecture
one
of
the
most
critical
skill
for
technology_7
developer
wherein
component_4
be
build
a
a
collection
of
different
small
component_5
rather
than
one
whole
component_10
instead
of
a
monolithic
component_10
you
have
several
independent
component_4
that
can
run
on
their
own
you
can
create
them
use
different
programming
technology_5
and
even
different
component_11
you
can
connector_data_1
big
and
complicate
component_4
with
quality_attribute_4
and
independent
component_12
that
connector_2
by
themselves
these
small
component_12
be
group
to
connector_3
all
the
requirement_4
of
the
big
monolithic
component_10
pattern_1
capture
your
requirement_5
scenario
answer
the
question
“what
problem
be
you
try
to
solve
”
instead
of
large
team
work
on
large
monolithic
project
small
more
agile
team
develop
the
component_5
use
the
technology_12
and
technology_16
they
be
most
comfortable
with
each
of
the
involve
component_12
be
independently
versioned
connector_2
and
quality_attribute_5
these
pattern_1
can
connector_4
with
other
pattern_1
and
can
have
unique
url
or
name
while
be
always
quality_attribute_6
and
consistent
even
when
failure
be
experience
what
be
the
benefit
of
pattern_1
there
be
many
benefit
to
use
pattern_1
some
of
them
be
relate
to
how
they
allow
your
developer
to
connector_5

other
influence
your
architecture
pattern_1
be
small
component_4
that
your
development
team
create
independently
since
they
connector_1
via
pattern_3
if
at
all
they’re
not
dependent
on
the
same
cod
technology_5
developer
can
use
the
programming
technology_5
that
they’re
most
familiar
with
this
help
them
come
work
fast
with
lower
cost
and
few
bug
since
your
team
be
work
on
small
component_4
and
more
focus
problem
domain
their
project
tend
to
be
more
agile
too
they
can
iterate
fast
connector_6
feature
on
a
short
schedule
and
turn
around
bug
fix
almost
immediately
they
often
find
more
opportunity
to
quality_attribute_7

also
pattern_1
improve
your
architecture’s
quality_attribute_8
too
with
monolithic
component_13
you
usually
end
up
“throwing
more
hardware”
at
the
problem
or
purchasing
expense
and
difficult
to
maintain
requirement_6

with
pattern_1
you
can
quality_attribute_5
horizontally
with
technology_17
solution
load
balancer
and
connector_data_2
also
a
more
and
more
requirement_6
embrace
the
requirement_7
you’re
probably
look
that
way
too
pattern_1
be
a
great
way
to
connector_7
there
requirement_7
component_14
lend
themselves
to

technology_2
containerization
pattern_1
lend
themselves
to
containerization
too
since
they
already
be
small
component_4
with
a
limit
set
of
connector_8
this
mean
you
can
quality_attribute_5
your
component_5
horizontally
with
technology_2
technology_18
and
technology_19
without
connector_9
any
customize

example
of
pattern_1
technology_16
for
technology_7
there
be
several
pattern_1
technology_16
that
you
can
use
for
develop
for
technology_7
some
of
these
be
technology_20
this
be

utility
that
would
make

development
easy
the
best
thing
about

be
it
exceptional

it’s
fill

technology_21
be
also
fast

start

such
a
technology_43

and
it
support

connector_16
it

it
do
however
have
an

technology_7
this
technology_16
be
ideal
for
pattern_8
component_1
that
require
you
to
handle
remote
connector_data_6
in

it
be
also
very
modular
and
support
pattern_10
technology_24
technology_16
also

that
even
ship
with

technology_25
come
with
a
steep

curve
that
be
make

best
practice
for
pattern_1
you
should
be
able
to
tell
by
now
that
make
the
shift
to
pattern_1
create
a
lot
of
benefit
for
development

and
the
requirement_5
they
create
opportunity
for
increase
quality_attribute_8
great
quality_attribute_14
and
cost
connector_18
but
there’s
no
such
thing
a
a
free
lunch
pattern_1
come
with
pitfall
of
their
own
here
be
some
best
practice
that
will
help
your
migration
each
of
your
pattern_1
should
use
their
own
connector_data_4
component_20
you
want
the
development
and
dev
ops
team
to
choose
the
component_21
for
each
of
their
component_6
they
should
have
an
opportunity
to
choose
the
connector_data_4
component_20
that
best
suit
their
project
at
the
same
time
if
team
connector_19
a
component_21
it’s
too
easy
for
them
to
connector_19
a
schema
create
a
monolithic
component_6
under
a
different
name
quality_attribute_12
pattern_1
in
container
isn’t
a
quality_attribute_2
idea
it’s
a
best
practice
too
i’ve
mention
several
time
that
pattern_14
team
should
choose
their
own
technology_12
how
do
and
dev
ops
manage
the
chaos
this
create
by
use
container
so
you
can
quality_attribute_12
and
pattern_15
your
component_13
with
a
single
set
of
technology_12
there’s
a
reason
why
pattern_8
component_5
and
pattern_1
be
often
associate
with
each
other
it’s
because
the
best
pattern_1
architecture
treat
their
component_5
a
stateless
rest’s
state
transfer
that
connector_20
state
down
to
the
component_22
mean
that
you
can
treat
your
component_23
a
stateless
and
run
your
a
quality_attribute_15
part
of
a
whole
you
only
need
to
worry
about
make
sure
that
there
be
enough
component_5
quality_attribute_6
to
handle
the
load
and
if
one
fail
another
can
pick
up
the
slack
additional
resource
and

on
pattern_1
for
further
connector_21
and
connector_data_7
on
pattern_1
include
some
helpful

visit
the
follow
resource
how

in

we’ve
discuss
what
pattern_1
be
and
how
they
can
help
you
improve
your
requirement_6
architecture
after
define
what
these
component_5
be
we
cover
their
major
benefit
then
we
look
at
some
of
the
most
popular
pattern_14
component_16
for
technology_7
then
we
wrap
up
with
a
look
at
