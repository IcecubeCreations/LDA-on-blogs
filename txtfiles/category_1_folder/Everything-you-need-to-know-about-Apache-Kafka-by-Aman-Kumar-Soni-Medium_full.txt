you
need
to
about
technology_1
kafkawhat
be
technology_2
technology_1
technology_2
be
a
pattern_1
component_1
build
to
quality_attribute_1
for
requirement_1
similar
to
technology_1
technology_3
or
technology_4
technology_2
enable
component_2
build
on
different
component_3
to
connector_1
via
pattern_2
connector_data_1
pass
but
technology_2
differ
from
these
more
traditional
pattern_1
component_4
in
key
way
it’s
design
to
quality_attribute_1
horizontally
by

more
commodity
component_5
it
provide
much
high
quality_attribute_2
for
both
component_6
and
component_7
component_8
it
can
be
use
to
support
both
pattern_3
and
real
time
use
requirement_2
it
doesn’t
support
technology_5
java’s
connector_data_1
orient
technology_6
technology_7
kafka’s
architecturebefore
we
explore
kafka’s
architecture
you
should
it
basic
terminology
a
component_6
be
a
component_8
that
can
publish
a
connector_data_1
to
a
topic
a
component_7
be
a
component_8
that
can
subscribe
to
one
or
more
topic
and
connector_2
connector_data_2
publish
to
topic
a
topic
category
be
the
name
of
the
fee
to
which
connector_data_2
be
publish
a
pattern_4
be
a
component_8
run
on
a
single
component_9
a
cluster
be
a
group
of
pattern_4
work
together
kafka’s
architecture
be
very
quality_attribute_3
which
can
connector_data_3
in
quality_attribute_4
requirement_3
and
quality_attribute_2
in
some
component_1
every
topic
in
technology_2
be
a
quality_attribute_3
requirement_4

when
a
component_6
publish
a
connector_data_1
the
technology_2
component_5
append
it
to
the
end
of
the
requirement_4
for
it
give
topic
the
component_5
also
assign
an
offset
which
be
a
number
use
to
permanently
identify
each
connector_data_1
a
the
number
of
connector_data_2
grow
the
requirement_5
of
each
offset
increase
for
example
if
the
component_6
publish
three
connector_data_2
the
first
one
might
connector_3
an
offset
of

the
second
an
offset
of

and
the
third
an
offset
of

when
the
technology_2
component_7
first
start
it
will
connector_4
a
connector_5
connector_data_4
to
the
component_5
ask
to
connector_6
any
connector_data_2
for
a
particular
topic
with
an
offset
requirement_5
high
than

the
component_5
will
connector_7
the
requirement_4
for
that
topic
and
the
three
connector_data_1
the
component_7
will
component_8
the
connector_data_1
then
connector_4
a
connector_data_4
for
connector_data_2
with
an
offset
high
than

and
so
on
in
technology_2
the
component_10
be
responsible
for
remember
the
offset
count
and
connector_8
connector_data_1
the
technology_2
component_5
doesn’t
track
or
manage
connector_data_1
consumption
by
default
a
technology_2
component_5
will
keep
a
connector_data_1
for
seven
day
a
background
component_11
in
the
component_5
connector_9
and
delete
connector_data_2
that
be
seven
day
or
old
a
component_7
can
connector_10
connector_data_2
a
long
a
they
be
on
the
component_5
it
can
connector_11
a
connector_data_1
multiple
time
and
even
connector_11
connector_data_2
in
reverse
order
of
receipt
but
if
the
component_7
fail
to
connector_6
the
connector_data_1
before
the
seven
day
be
up
it
will
miss

can
provide

for

concept
component_14
component_2
that
generate
a
lot
of
can
be
difficult
to
connector_17
with
traditional
component_16
and
an
additional
feature
in
technology_2
connector_18
“log
compaction”
can
preserve
for
the
lifetime
of
the
component_17
basically
with
requirement_4
compaction
instead
of
discard
the
requirement_4
at
pre
configure
time
interval

day

day
etc
technology_2
can
keep
the
entire
set
of
recent
around
for
all
the
key
in
the
set
this
help
make
the
component_18
very
loosely
couple
because
it
can
lose
or
discard
requirement_4
and
restore
the
domain
state
from
a
requirement_4
of
preserve

should
you
use
technology_2
the
answer
will
always
quality_attribute_6
on

that
a

have
but
a
the
traditional
connector_data_1
pattern_4
be
not
a
one
size
fit
all
neither
be
technology_2
if
you’re
look
to
build
a

resilient
connector_data_5
component_12

technology_2
can
serve
a
the

by

and
keep
all
of
the
“facts”
or
“events”
for
a
component_1
some
of
the
use
caseshere
be
a
description
of
a
few
of
the
popular
use
requirement_2
for
technology_1
kafka®
metricsevery
component_19
at
linkedin
include
at
least
a
technology_2
component_6
since
this
be
how
metric
be
propagate
this
include
technical
metric
query
quality_attribute_2
quality_attribute_7
etc
a
well
a
requirement_11
metric

impression
click
etc
these
be
emit
at
the
rate
of
one
per
metric
per
minute
per
component_20
and
thus
represent
aggregate
connector_data_7
count
average
max
percentile
etc
that
connector_3
load
into
a
time
series
component_16
these
metric
can
thus
be
almost
immediately
visualize
in
requirement_12
and
their
trend
over
time
can
be
examine
threshold
alert
be
also
fire
from
this
connector_data_5
trackingthis
be
similar
to
requirement_11
metric
except
that
it
be
typically
more
complex
than
a
quality_attribute_3
numerical
requirement_5
go
into
a
time

component_16
this
include
for
example
component_21
pattern_7

which
contain
many
dimension
member

component_21
key
etc
these
be
emit
at
the
rate
of
one

and
can
thus
be
much
high
