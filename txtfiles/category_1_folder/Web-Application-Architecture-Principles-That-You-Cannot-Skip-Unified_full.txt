connector_1
what
s
inside
ever
wonder
what
happen
when
you
search
for
a
web
component_5
on
an
internet
browser
you
type
out
an
connector_2
or
a
query
and
within
second
be
present
with
a
vast
of
relevant
connector_data_1
or
the
exact
you
be
look
for
how
do
that
work
be
it
radio
signal
or
maybe
oompa
loompas
work
behind
the
scene
actually
it’s
none
of
that
the
thing
that
make
it
possible
for
u
to
browse
and
pattern_1
anything
and
everything
on
the
internet
the
thing
that
be
enabling
you
to
see
this
right
now
be
something
connector_3
web
component_1
architecture
and
throughout
this

we
be
go
to
talk
about
everything
you
need
to
about
it
how
about
we
start
by
talk
about
what
a
web
component_1
architecture
be

what
be
a
web
component_1
architecture
and
how
do
it
work
before
go
any
further
into
the
subject
we
have
to
two
thing
first
what
be
a
web
component_1
architecture
second
how
exactly
do
it
work
so
let’s
start
a
what
be
a
web
component_1
architecture
it
be
all
about
the
connector_4
happen
between
component_1
component_6
and
technology_3
component_7
on
the
web
the
architecture
not
only
connector_5
all
these
different
element
but
also
ensure
the
simultaneous
requirement_5
of
all
these
multiple
component_1
now
think
about
the
webpage
search
metaphor
we
use
at
the
begin
the
first
thing
in
this
requirement_6
you
be
do
be
type
a
url
and
click
on
the
search

when
you
be
do
that
the
web
browser
be
connector_data_2
for
that
specific
web
connector_2
you
type
this
connector_data_2
be
connector_6
by
the
internet
face
component_8
contain
connector_data_3
about
the
specific
the
webpage
be
a
part
of
the
component_8
then
connector_7
a
to
the
browser
a
a
connector_8
to
the
connector_data_2
make
those
be
then
connector_9
by
the
browser
to
show
the
connector_data_2
web
component_5
to
the
component_9
web
component_3
architecture
work
in
the
same
way
in
the
entire
component_10
describe
below
the
most
important
part
be
the
requirement_7
by
the
web
browser
this
or
not
include
specific
instruction
tell
the
browser
how
to
respond
to
different
kind
of
component_9
connector_10
and
input
in
the
requirement_6
of
a
web
component_3
development
however
the
include
all
the
sub
component_11
along
with
the
external
component_1
interchange
for
the
whole
of
the
component_1
the
aim
of
a
high
requirement_8
web
component_1
architecture
be
to
run
the
of
the
web
component_1
and
give
the
component_12
an
quality_attribute_2
quality_attribute_3
and
quality_attribute_4
experience
b
how
do
it
work
behind
a
web
component_1
these
be
the
component_13
side
and
component_8
side

these
cod
be
an
integral
part
of
the
architecture
that
run
the
component_1
the
component_8
side
be
connector_11
use
technology_4
technology_5
technology_6
technology_7
technology_8
technology_9
etc
any
with
the
ability
to
respond
to
technology_10
connector_data_4
have
the
ability
to
run
on
a
component_8
the
be
responsible
for
create
the
component_5
connector_data_2
by
component_9
along
with
connector_12
and
connector_13
various
connector_data_5
include
a
component_9
profile
and
component_9
input
the
component_8
side
be
never
pattern_1
by
the
component_9
the
component_13
side
be
connector_11
use
a
combination
of
cs
technology_11
and
technology_6
the
component_13
side
be
requirement_7
by
the
web
browser
and
can
be
pattern_1
and
edit
by
the
component_9
it
technology_2
to
the
component_9
connector_10
and
input
connector_14
only
via
technology_10
connector_data_2
the
component_13
side
be
unable
to
connector_1
off
a
component_8
in
a
direct
way
the
architecture
of
a
web
component_1
be
make
up
of
different
component_11
these
different
component_14
work
together
simultaneously
to
make
sure
that
the
component_1
work
flawlessly
but
what
be
these
component_11
let’s
find
out

the
various
component_14
of
web
component_1
architecture
it
go
without
say
that
the
web
component_3
architecture
include
different
component_11
these
component_14
can
be
divide
into
two
category
–
ui
ux
component_14
structural

a
ui
ux
component_14
the
ui
ux
component_11
or
the
component_9
component_14
include
activity
requirement_9
requirement_10
setting
connector_data_6
statistic
etc
even
though
ui
ux
component_14
include
a
lot
of
different
part
they
do
not
participate
in
the
of
the
web
component_3
architecture
this
category
of
component_14
form
the
requirement_11
of
the
component_3
b
structural
component_14
the
structural
component_14
of
the
architecture
be
an
integral
part
of
how
the
web
component_3

the
structural
component_14
consist
of
two
part
component_13
side
and
component_8
side
the
component_13
side
of
the
structural
component_11
enable
component_12
to
connector_15
with
the
of
web
component_4
and
develop
use
technology_11

and
technology_6
the
component_8

j
etc
the
architecture
for
web
component_17
have
go
through
many
evolution
and
the
component_18
have
connector_16
many
time
base
on
the
kind
of
technology_13
use
here
be
a
connector_data_7
of
all
kind
of
component_19
for
web

architecture

web
component_3
architecture
component_18
past
present
and
future
a
we
mention
before
quality_attribute_5
on
the
technology_13
and
demand
the
component_18
for
web
component_1
architecture
have
connector_16
many
time
throughout
the
age
what
start
out
a
a
one
tier
or
one
pattern_2
architecture
have
now
come
to
include
numerous
component_20
and
component_13
side
a
one
tier
component_1
the
one
tier
architecture
keep
all
the
element
of
the
architecture
the

technology_3
and
back
end
connector_data_5
all
in
one
place
even
though
the
development
of
such
an
architecture
would
be
quality_attribute_6
it
be
also
go
to
be
incredibly
vulnerable
since
the
entire
architecture
connector_17
and
exist
on
only
one
pattern_2
failure
of
one
element
would
lead
to
the
failure
of
the
entire
architecture
b
two
tier
component_1
the
two
tier
architecture
follow
the
pattern_3
architecture
in
this
requirement_6
the
ui
part
and
the
component_8
part
of
the
component_1
exist
on
different
pattern_2
which
mean
the
failure
of
one
component_11
will
not
be
affect
the
other
the
two
tier
architecture
be
comparatively
fast
than
the
one
tier
architecture
because
of
two
reason
firstly
the
component_13
connector_data_2
go
directly
to
the
component_8
since
there
be
no
pattern_4
between
the
two
a
a
connector_data_8
the
connector_data_2
be
directly
connector_9
secondly
both
pattern_2
be
tightly
connector_18
technology_14
three
tier
component_1
the
three
tier
architecture
consist
of
a
component_13
side
technology_3
and
component_8
side
the
connector_data_4
make
by
the
component_13
side
of
the
component_1
go
through
the
technology_3
and
to
the
component_8
side
and
vise
versa
the
different
pattern_2
of
the
three
tier
component_1
be
a
mention
below
i
design
pattern_2
presentation
pattern_2
the
presentation
or
the
design
pattern_2
be
the
topmost
pattern_2
or
tier
of
the
web
component_3
architecture
the
presentation
pattern_2
be
build
keep
in
mind
the
requirement_13
of
quality_attribute_7
ux
design
this
pattern_2
enable
the
component_9
to
connector_15
and
engage
with
the
rest
of
the
component_1
this
tier
also
play
a
huge
part
in
connector_14
with
the
rest
of
the
component_21
and
display
the
connector_data_1
to
the
component_9
ii
requirement_12

the
requirement_12

also

a
the
connector_data_5
connector_19
pattern_2
coordinate
all
the
within
the
component_1
through
component_10
command
and
connector_10
it
connector_20
from
the
component_9
the
requirement_12
pattern_2
make
logical
decision
and
evaluation
it
also
move
and
component_22
the
connector_data_5
between
the
two
pattern_2
to
provide
a
smooth
requirement_11
to
the
component_9
iii
connector_data_5
pattern_2
in
a
three
tier
architecture
the
connector_data_5
pattern_2
be
where
connector_data_5
be
component_23
and
connector_21
late
to
be
show
to
the
component_9
the
connector_data_5
component_23
on
this
pattern_2
be
connector_22
and
component_10
by
the
connector_data_5
connector_19
pattern_2
late
on
this
connector_data_5
be
once
again
pass
on
to
the
requirement_12
pattern_2
to
be
component_10
and
then
display
to
the
component_12
through
the
presentation
pattern_2
descend
from
the
three
tier
architecture
today
web
component_4
be
use
the
n
tier
component_1
component_24
which
be
quality_attribute_8
among
a
number
of
component_25
in
the
requirement_14
the
“n”
refer
to
the
number
of
pattern_2
of
tier
that
be
use
in
the
architecture
with
the
n
tier
architecture
the
developer
be
able
to
create
quality_attribute_9
and
quality_attribute_10
component_1
best
fit
for
requirement_1
level
pattern_3
component_1
the
n
tier
web
component_3
architecture
provide
quality_attribute_11
and
quality_attribute_4
solution
that
be
fault
tolerant
quality_attribute_10
and
easily
quality_attribute_12
throughout
the
year
people
have

to
utilize
technology_13
in
different
way
and
that’s
why
today
we
have
different
version
of
web
component_1
architecture
they
vary
in
style
and
build
so
what
be
these
different
type
of
web
component_3
architecture

the
various
type
of
web
component_3
architecture
the
type
of
architecture
of
a
web
component_1
be
dependent
on
how
the
component_1
component_16
be
quality_attribute_8
among
the
component_13
and
component_8
side
currently
there
be
three
basic
type
of
web
component_3
architecture
use
by
developer
viz
a
single
component_5
web
component_1
the
single
component_5
web
component_17
be
not
only
light
weight
in
nature
but
this
architecture
work
fast
than
the
other
architecture
use
rather
than
loading
completely
component_5
from
the
component_20
every
time
the
component_9
perform
an
action
single
component_5
architecture
only
connector_data_9
the
exist
component_5
with
relevant
connector_data_5
the
foundation
behind
make
spa
a
reality
be
technology_15
a
concise
form
of
pattern_5
technology_6
and
technology_16
it
help
to
enable
component_5
connector_23
these
web
component_4
be
design
to
only
connector_data_2
the
most
necessary
content
and
connector_data_3
from
the
component_6
lead
to
interactive
requirement_11
b
pattern_6
pattern_6
be
small
lightweight
and
increase
the
quality_attribute_13
and
quality_attribute_14
of
the
development
component_10
the
component_14
of
a
web
component_3
build
use
pattern_7
web
component_1
architecture
be
never
directly
dependent
on
each
other
when
the
web
component_1
need
multiple
instance
to
run
on
different
component_26
to
complete
the
different
requirement
and
requirement_5
pattern_6
web
component_3
architecture
be
the
best
option
to
go
for
it
be
a
loosely
couple
architecture
create
by
the
collaboration
of
different
component_27
quality_attribute_15
and
developer
by
separate
development
team
in
most
requirement_6
each
component_27
in
this
type
of
architecture
be
independently
quality_attribute_16
technology_14
serverless
architecture
in
serverless
architecture
the
developer
outsource
the
component_20
and
infrastructural
requirement_15
from
a
third
party
requirement_16
infrastructure
component_27
technology_17
this
way
the
component_1
can
connector_9
the
component_16
without
have
to
worry
about
infrastructure
relate
thing
it
be
perfect
for
requirement_3
that
do
not
want
to
support
and
manage
the
component_20
and
hardware
for
their
web
component_1
with
the
implementation
of
serverless
architecture
the
developer
can
solely
focus
on
the
individual
of
the
component_1

an
excellent
example
of
a
requirement_16
component_27
technology_17
would
be
technology_18
lambda
which
help
developer
to
run
any
kind
of
the
component_1
without
have
to
worry
about
the
connector_24
of
the
component_8
component_10
with
serverless
architecture
which
be
also

a
faa

a
a
component_27
developer
can
compose
the
component_1
and
run
it
an
individual
autonomous

these
component_28
by
the
faa
technology_17
can
be
automatically
quality_attribute_17
the
entire
type
of
architecture
be
very
quality_attribute_2
a
the
developer
need
to
pay
only
for
the
resource
they
have
use

what
you
should
about
web
component_8
architecture
the
term
web
component_8
architecture
refer
to
the
layout
of
a
web
component_8
that
facilitate
the
design
development
and
deployment
of
the
say
component_8
the
connector_data_10
a
web
component_8
need
to
perform
be
to
complete
the
connector_10
and
demand
make
by
the
component_13
which
include
browser
and
requirement_2
component_4
via
quality_attribute_4
technology_19
web
component_20
be
an
integral
part
of
web
component_4
which
be
why
there
need
to
be
more
emphasis
on
the
overall
web
component_8
health
include
storage
capacity
memory
computing
power
and
requirement_8
apart
from
the
component_3
tier
a
technology_20
the
angular
technology_21
web
component_1
architecture
work
in
a
dual
mode
a
a
component_21
and
a
technology_22
for
technology_11
and
typescript
apart
from
reduce
the
size
the
ngmodules
offer
many
benefit
one
of
the
many
feature
that
make
angular
so
popular
with
developer
be
the
use
of
the
pattern_8
component_18
by
split
the
requirement_12
component_16
pattern_2
connector_data_5
pattern_2
and
presentation
pattern_2
all
the
pattern_2
be
manage
with
ease
and
quality_attribute_18
in
the
below
architecture
diagram
you
can
see
the
architecture
of
a

it
essentially
form
the
pattern_1
part
of
the
component_1
and
in
order
to
manage
the
connector_data_5
flow
in
a
complex
component_1
you
can
use
flux
along
with
technology_2
and
together
they
form
the
