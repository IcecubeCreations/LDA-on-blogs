Top 56 ETL Tools for Data Integration


Data Integration Platforms combine data from disparate sources into meaningful and valuable information. These platforms allows you to extract data, transform it in any style and load (ETL) it to any system, supporting faster time to value and reduced IT risk. The integrated platform delivers a wide range of data quality capabilities from data profiling, standardization, matching and enrichment to active data-quality monitoring.
Extract, transform, and load (ETL) refers to the process of extracting data from outside sources, transforms it to fit operational needs, loads it into the end target database, more specifically, operational data store, data mart, or data warehouse.
ETL systems are commonly used to integrate data from multiple applications, typically developed and supported by different vendors or hosted on separate computer hardware. The first part of an ETL process involves extracting the data from the source systems. The transform stage applies a series of rules or functions to the extracted data from the source to derive the data for loading into the end target. The load phase loads the data into the end target, usually the data warehouse (DW) and this process vary depending on the requirements of the organization.
 What are Data Integration Platforms?
ETL refers to Extraction, Transform, and Load software. Extract reads the data into a single format from multiple sources. Transform, in this step, data is linked and made consistent from various systems. Load process ensures that the transformed data is now written out to a warehouse.
Since 1970s ETL has been used by business and organizations to acquire an associated view of data to enable improved business decisions.  Today, many organizations have adopted this data integration software which collects data from multiple sources as their main data integration toolbox.
The system performs the data integration into three processes extracting, transforming, and loading. The three processes are interconnected and they are launched after one has successful executed. The system supports all types of data formats. For the system to perform its duties, all the three processes must run smoothly. When an organization uses the ETL software it assured of better information and excellent decision which are well analyzed and organized for the best performance and growth of the organization.

 What are the features of Data Integration Platforms?
ETL software supports the integrations with operational data stores, master data management hubs, BI platforms and the cloud. Also, organizations integrates libraries of inbuilt ETL transformation with their transaction and interaction data system for it to run on Hadoop. ETL refers to the process of extracting data from multiple sources and transforming it to suit businesses and loading it into a database.
There are several reasons why you need ETL software. First, it helps in data flow management. Using ETL software allows you to manage different data flows. Second, Using ETL software makes work easier to work as a team therefore, you need this software
ETL Software enhances business intelligence. The software is designed with high speed for the data retrieval and analysis. It is able to store high amount data and at the same time querying it. It enhances timely data access. Through the use of this software, users, investors, managers and other stakeholders in the organization can access the data whenever they need it. It leads to higher return on investment because it is able to generate a higher amount of revenue as a result of cost savings. ETL software generally integrate data from several systems that are developed and supported by different dealers or hosted on separate computers.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONHi Imanuel,
I was not pleased with the complexity of the “big” ETL tools, and wanted something really lightweight, scriptable and flexible. I rolled my own, and ended up with something that might be interesting to other people facing the same challenges as I do. NoFrillsTransformation was conceived primarily as a way of simplifying data loading and extracting to Salesforce (by leveraging the Data Loader). Meanwhile, it has gained other functionality aswell, like connecting to various database sources (currently SQLite, MySql, Oracle and SQL Server).
Its strength lies in the way it handles the configuration; it’s pure XML, no GUI at all, but it’s fairly simple to model and get what you want. It’s open source, open to contributions, and I’d be happy if somebody gave it a go.
Some pointers into the documentation:
https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/haufe.no-frills-transformation/wiki/Getting-Started
https://github.com/Haufe-Lexware/haufe.no-frills-transformation/wiki/Config-File-Documentation
Chances are this is just enough for many ETL/migration processes.
Best regards,
Martin

ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONHi Martin,
Does your ETL engine accept Web Services as a source (reader) and destination (writer)? I would be interested in using the engine for my project.
Thank you,
Leonid

ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONThanks for this complete article.
ETLs are the most powerful tools in terms of data integration. Unfortunately, most of them require good technical coding skills, so I for instance, someone like me with a business profile will need to hire a developer to handle such a tool. A friend of mine who worked on high profile data migration projects decided to create Myddleware, a user-friendly, easy-to-handle ETL tool for business users, which I am very happy about. It’s free and open source.

For contributions : https://github.com/Myddleware 
I would be very much interested in hearing about other open source tools designed for non technical business profiles though.
Thank you, 
Barbara

ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONDon’t see Centerprise on this list. We’ve heard some really good things about the platform from our partners. Has anybody used it? I haven’t gotten around to giving the free trial a spin myself, but I am intrigued.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONWow, thanks Imanuel,  that should be the most comprehensive list out there!
You should also take a look at airbyte.io. It’s an open-source EL(T) platform, an open-source alternative to Fivetran.
Since their soft launch 3 months ago, 300 companies started using them to sync data. So worth a look :).
