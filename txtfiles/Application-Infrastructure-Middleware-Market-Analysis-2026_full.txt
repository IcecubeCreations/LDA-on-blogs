Report Digest
Request Methodology




Application infrastructure middleware (AIM) is software that is considered as a midway among the various applications and devices. A common application of middleware is to allow programs written for access to a particular database to access other databases. Typically, middleware programs provide messaging services so that different applications can communicate. In addition, middleware software is used as a mediator between networked operating systems and applications. It provides well known reusable solutions to frequently encountered problems such as heterogeneity, interoperability, security, and dependability. Thus, application infrastructure middleware (AIM) plays a very effective role in application integration in various industries.
In recent years, most enterprises have developed applications that run simultaneously, in order to accomplish their business tasks more appropriately and precisely. The global application infrastructure and middleware (AIM) software market is expanding at a rapid pace. As an enabler of service-oriented architecture, AIM has successfully established itself and is increasingly evolving as a base technology for Big Data, analytics, and mobile technology along with cloud computing. Further, with networks becoming increasingly pervasive, middleware appears as a major building block for the development of future software systems. Over the years, the role of middleware has proven central to address the ever increasing complexity of distributed systems that can be transformed in a reusable way.
Recent developments in information systems have been a driving factor for the application infrastructure middleware market. This is the result of adoption of information systems in sectors such as banks, educational institutes, hospitals, ministries, etc. for various solutions. Applications are being developed for various business sectors that perform tasks related to customers, employers, sale and purchase, billing and finance, and technical and human resources. One such application is enterprise application integration (EAI), which provides the ability to merge many applications running in an enterprise through an intermediary interface. It can combine all applications, their databases, and processes running internally or externally.
Application infrastructure middleware is considered as a building block for other software such as integration layer, business process management, portals, mobile applications, ERPs, and CRMs. Enterprises are anticipated to adopt middleware applications on a large scale as they provides seamless integration between disparate applications. Moreover, a rise in demand for end-to-end quality of service (QoS) components across regions has been boosting the market. However, a major challenge faced by the application infrastructure middleware market is commoditization of larger bundled solutions based around middleware-integrated components that affect industries and result in an increase in the cost of application middleware. Application infrastructure middleware provides opportunities for industries to develop new middleware capabilities in order to construct next-generation network-centric applications.
The application infrastructure middleware market can be segmented based on component, type, enterprise size, end-use industry, and region. Based on component, the application infrastructure middleware market can be classified into software and services. The software segment can be categorized into on-premise and cloud based. The cloud based segment can be further divided into public, private, and hybrid. In terms of type, the application infrastructure middleware market can be classified into sever based and client based. Based on enterprise size, the global application infrastructure middleware market can be divided into small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and large enterprises. In terms of industry, the market can be segmented into health care, telecom & information technology, defense, government & public sector, and education. Based on region, the global application infrastructure middleware market can be classified into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa (MEA), and South America. North America and Europe are likely to account for prominent market shares due to the presence of developed countries such as the U.S., the U.K, France, and Germany. Asia Pacific is an emerging region of the market due to the penetration of technological solutions and advancements in networking.
Key vendors operating in the application infrastructure middleware market are IBM Corporation, Oracle Corporation, TIBCO Software, Salesforce.com, SAP SE, Microsoft Corporation, Software AG, Red Hat, Inc., Fujitsu Ltd, Cisco Systems, Inc., Unisys Corporation, and Informatica
