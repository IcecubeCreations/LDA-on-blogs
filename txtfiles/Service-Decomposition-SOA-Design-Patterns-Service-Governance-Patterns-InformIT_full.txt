Service Decomposition

How can the granularity of a service be increased subsequent to its implementation?

Table 16.5. Profile summary for the Service Decomposition pattern.





Problem



Overly coarse-grained services can inhibit optimal composition design.





Solution



An already implemented coarse-grained service can be decomposed into two or more fine-grained services.





Application



The underlying service logic is restructured, and new service contracts are established. This pattern will likely require Proxy Capability (497) to preserve the integrity of the original coarse-grained service contract.





Impacts



An increase in fine-grained services naturally leads to larger, more complex service composition designs.





Principles



Service Loose Coupling, Service Composability





Architecture



Service




Problem
When modeling services during the initial analysis phases it is common to take practical considerations into account. For example, what may ideally be represented by a set of fine-grained business service candidates is later combined into a smaller number of coarse-grained services primarily due to performance and other infrastructure-related concerns motivated by the need to keep service composition sizes under control.
After a service inventory architecture matures and more powerful and sophisticated technology and runtime products are incorporated, larger, more complex service compositions become a reality. When designing such compositions, it is generally preferable to keep the footprints of individual services as small as possible because only select service capabilities are required to automate a given parent business task. However, when forced to work with overly coarse-grained services, composition performance can be negatively affected, and the overall composition designs can be less than optimal (Figure 16.13).





Figure 16.13 An Invoice service with a functional context originally derived from three separate business entities ends up existing as a large software program with a correspondingly large footprint, regardless of which capability a composition may need to compose.


NOTE
Another circumstance under which this problem condition can occur is when services are being produced via a meet-in-the-middle delivery process, where a top-down analysis is only partially completed prior to service development. In this delivery approach, the top-down process continues concurrently with service delivery projects. There is a commitment to revising implemented service designs after the top-down analysis progresses to a point where necessary changes to the original service inventory are identified. For more details regarding SOA project delivery strategies, see Chapter 10 in Service-Oriented Architecture: Concepts, Technology, and Design.

Solution
The coarse-grained service is decomposed into a set of fine-grained services that collectively represent the functional context of the original service but establish distinct functional contexts of their own (Figure 16.14).





Figure 16.14 The original, coarse-grained Invoice service is decomposed into three separate services, one of which remains associated with general invoice processing but only encapsulates a subset of the original capabilities.

Application
Carrying out this pattern essentially requires that the existing, coarse-grained service be broken apart and its logic reorganized into new, finer-grained functional boundaries.
Therefore, the first step is usually to revisit the service inventory blueprint and decide how the service can be re-modeled into multiple service candidates. As part of this process, new capability candidates will also need to be defined, especially if Decomposed Capability (504) was not taken into account during the service's original design. After the modeling is completed, the new services are subject to the standard lifecycle phases, beginning with contract design (based on the modeled service candidates) and all the way through to final testing and quality assurance phases (Figure 16.15).





Figure 16.15 The new, fine-grained services each provide fewer capabilities and therefore also impose smaller program sizes.

Unless it is decided to also retrofit previous consumer programs that formed dependencies on the original service, Proxy Capability (497) will likely need to be applied to preserve the original service contract for backwards compatibility.

NOTE
The concepts behind this pattern can also be applied in reverse, where two or more fine-grained services are combined into one coarse-grained service. The use of Proxy Capability (497) would still apply for preserving the original service contracts. This is the basis of a pattern called Service Consolidation which, at the time of this writing, was classified as a candidate pattern that is available for review at SOAPatterns.org.

Impacts
The extent to which Service Decomposition can impact a service inventory depends on how established a service is and how many consumer programs have formed relationships on it. The more consumers involved, the more complicated and disruptive this pattern can be.
Because this pattern is commonly applied after an inventory architecture has matured, its application needs to be carefully planned together with the repeated application of Proxy Capability (497).
The preventative use of Decomposed Capability (504) can ease the impact of Service Decomposition and will also result in a cleaner separation of functional service contexts.
Relationships
Service Decomposition has a series of relationships with other service-level patterns, most notably Service Refactoring (484). When a service is upgraded as a result of a refactoring effort, the application of Service Decomposition may very well be the means by which this is carried out.
As explained in the pattern description for Proxy Capability (497), Service Decomposition relies on that pattern to implement the actual partitioning via the redevelopment effort required to turn one or more regular capabilities into proxies. As a result, this pattern shares several of the same patterns as Proxy Capability (497).
Service Decomposition is most frequently applied to agnostic services, therefore tying it to Entity Abstraction (175) and Utility Abstraction (168). However, the result of this pattern can introduce a measure of service redundancy due to the need for Proxy Capability (497) to violate Service Normalization (131) to some extent.





Figure 16.16 Service Decomposition is a refactoring-related approach to splitting up service logic that ties into numerous patterns that shape service logic and contracts.


Case Study Example
The case study example for Service Refactoring (484) explained how the Employee service was reengineered for a number of reasons. One of the results of this effort is that the service is now more scalable and can handle increased usage loads. The primary reason scalability was addressed is in preparation for new, upcoming service compositions that will require access to employee data and functionality. Those compositions were in the planning stages at that time and are now in production.
Some preliminary statistics show that despite the increase in usage thresholds, the Employee service is still excessively strained, and there have already been complaints about latency and memory overhead associated with the service's invocation and participation as part of the overall composition.
At first the team responsible for the Employee service considers Redundant Implementation (345) to help alleviate this situation. While this would address some of the latency issues, it would not solve the memory overhead issue.
The team then explores the option of splitting the functionality in the Employee service into two separate services. From a back-end perspective, there is an opportunity to do this in a relatively clean-cut manner. Currently, the service encapsulates functionality from an HR ERP system and a custom-developed reporting application. However, as a member of the entity service layer, the architects and business analysts involved would like to preserve the business entity-based functional context in each of the two services it would be split into. Therefore, they don't want to make the decision based on the current service implementation architecture alone.
They turn to the information architecture group responsible for maintaining the master entity relationship diagram to look for suitable employee-related entities that might form the basis of separate services. They locate an Employee Records entity that has a relationship with the parent Employee entity. Employee Records represents historical employee information, such as overtime, sick days, complaints, promotions, injuries, etc.
The team reviews the current entity service functionality and additional capabilities that may need to be added (such as those modeled as part of the service inventory blueprint but not yet implemented). They also look into the back-end systems being encapsulated. The custom-developed reporting application does not provide all of the required features to support a service dedicated to Employee Records processing. The team would need for this service to continue accessing the HR ERP system, plus eventually upcoming Employee Records capabilities will need to further access the central data warehouse.
On the bright side, their original usage statistics indicate that some of the latency issues resulted from the Employee service being tied up executing long-running reporting queries. If this type of functionality were to exist in a separate service, the primary Employee capabilities would be more scalable and reliable, and the Employee service would be "lighter" and a more effective composition participant.
After taking all these factors into consideration, the team feels that it makes sense to break off historical reporting functionality into a separate service appropriately called "Employee Records." The first challenge they face is that the existing Employee service contract is already being used by many consumer programs. If they move capabilities from this service to another, they will introduce significant disruption. For this situation, they apply Proxy Capability (497), as explained in the next case study example.


NOTE
The preceding scenario describes one possible option as to how a service can be decomposed. Another design option is to split the one entity service into an entity and utility service in order to accommodate more practical concerns. Either way, how a service is decomposed is ultimately best determined by a thorough analysis to ensure that your business requirements are fully met.
