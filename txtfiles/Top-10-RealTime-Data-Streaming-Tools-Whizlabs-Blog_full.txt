3. Apache Kafka
Apache Kafka is also a leading mention among real-time data streaming tools. Enterprises can use Apache Kafka for the management of peak data ingestion loads and also as a big data message bus. The capability of Apache Kafka to manage peak data ingestion loads is a unique and formidable advantage over common storage engines. 
The general application of Kafka is in the back end for the integration of microservices. In addition, it can also support other real-time data streaming portals such as Flink or Spark. Interestingly, the majority of real-time data streaming platforms can integrate effectively with Kafka to provide stream analytics and stream processing. 
Kafka can also send data to other platforms for streaming analytics for the purpose of analysis. Since Kafka is a comparatively new technology than others, users can find it a little bit difficult to operate. However, the features of data redundancy and fault tolerance offered a credible boost to the reputation of Kafka, among other tools used for data streaming. 
4. Apache Storm
Apache Storm is the next popular mention among the top open-source data streaming tools. Storm is an ideal tool for real-time data analytics. Built by Twitter, Apache Storm specifically aims at the transformation of data streams. This is a considerable difference from Hadoop which is one of the top Big Data tools, which relies on batch processing. 
On the other hand, the applications of Apache Storm are also useful for ETL, online machine learning, and many others. The foremost capability of Apache Stream is faster data processing. Apache Stream can carry out processes at the nodes with faster data processing than its competitors. Most important of all, you can integrate Apache Storm with Hadoop to improve its capability for larger throughputs.
