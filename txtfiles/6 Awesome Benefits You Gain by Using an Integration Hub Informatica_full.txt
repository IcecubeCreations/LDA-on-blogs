6 Awesome Benefits You Gain by Using an Integration Hub

It seems that only a couple of years ago data integration architecture was simple. If you wanted to move data from one place to another, you simply used a manually triggered ETL process, and that was it. These days, however, most enterprises and organizations are going through a digital transformation – which requires a different approach. To reap the benefits of their data assets, organizations need to connect hundreds of data sources and targets – on premises and in the cloud – in different frequencies, types, and structures. This change amplifies existing challenges and creates some new ones. Consider that:

New application integration is costly (in both time and money)
Orchestrating and governing integration is complicated and non-centralized
Legacy integrations are a “hairball”
Data is kept in silos
Specialized development skills are still required

3 elements of a modern data integration paradigm
To address these challenges, the enterprise needs to adopt a modern paradigm of data integration:
 


A new integration pattern that will streamline the complexity of data and application integration needs
A new architecture that will allow IT admins and developers to govern and synchronize data flows and will enable systems to respond to events in any latency, from real-time streaming to scheduled batch
A user friendly and simple mechanism that will facilitate data democratization and enable self-service access to data assets to non-developer stakeholders within the organization

Enter the “Integration Hub.”
By decoupling sources from targets and facilitating a publish and subscribe approach, the integration hub boosts the underlying data integration engines and provides the following benefits:

Efficient cloud and on-premises data integration
Consistent data synchronization between apps
Standardization of data across disparate systems
Management of new integration points
Governance of integration across systems
Self-service access for business users

In future posts I will go over the challenges and use cases that organizations face and expand on the benefits that can be gained by using Informatica Integration Hub.
Click here to learn more about the Informatica Integration Hub, and how it enables you to orchestrate, unify, govern, and share your data, while at the same time allowing you to seamlessly manage mixed-latency data delivery: data driven, real-time or batch, to all systems.
You can also learn more in our Meet the Experts webinar: “Deep Dive and Demo – Informatica Cloud Integration Hub.”
