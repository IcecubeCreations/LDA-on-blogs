Invicti Web Application Security Scanner - the only solution that delivers automatic verification of vulnerabilities with Proof-Based Scanning‚Ñ¢. 


The stock market industry has witnessed huge technological adoption in recent years.
This change in the face of the stock market industry is growing so swiftly that it has created a paradigm shift, influencing modern financial institutions. Innovative technologies like cloud-based application programming interface (API) are inflowing the landscape for all good reasons.
But why is everyone talking suddenly about Stock APIs?
Well, to understand this, let‚Äôs zoom out on the relevance of stock APIs for financial market data consumers.
Understanding Stock market APIs
Stock market APIs are a boon to traders, investors, and software developers. It is because stock APIs can connect these data consumers effortlessly with accurate and relevant data sources. On top of that, obtaining stock market data through APIs is simple, coherent, and predictable in a properly structured format.

Stock APIs aim at facilitating data sharing, access, and payment transactions. You can retrieve financial data when you need, share data between APIs for consumers, business partners, company employees, and third-party vendors. Besides, you can easily sync data using these APIs across different applications.
So, what happens without a stock API?
In this case, stock market data consumers would have to write complicated codes in order to parse raw data directly from stock exchanges. And this is a tough process due to the availability of stock exchanges in abundance, each with different data transmission processes.
How to leverage stock market data to build financial products?
Stock market APIs come in handy for that matter, making everything smooth like cheese by parsing raw market data and presenting it in an accessible and clean format.
If you are building your financial products like a trading prediction application, a stock API can prove to be of great help. You can leverage these APIs to know the latest market price and follow historical trends to keep up with instruments like equities, currencies, fixed-income products, and more.
It‚Äôs highly essential to know the latest price and trends in real-time so you can leverage them to the maximum potential and calculate the risks involved.
Market data that you need for a specific instrument include the latest bid, exchange code, trading venue, and instrument identifier. It can also add other data such as offer sizes, traded volume, and so on.
Stock APIs help you obtain those time-sensitive data so you can take actionable insights into building your financial products.
However, there are some pitfalls associated with APIs, as all of them are not created equal. So, despite their magic to parse raw stock market data, here are a few factors you should consider.
Available API types üîë
APIs can be of different types ‚Äì Rest API, FTP, TCP, etc. Choosing the one according to your data requirements and speed would be wise.
While a standard Rest API helps you obtain data in real-time and is relatively fast, if you don‚Äôt want to settle for standard speed and instead want a faster alternative, TCP can be your option. With TCP, there‚Äôs no need to request for fetching the data, contrary to Rest API.
However, if you are okay with standard data speed, you can go for FTP that provides data at the end of a day. This way, you can save a few bucks as well.
API calls üóìÔ∏è
Many data vendors limit the API call frequency that a buyer can make in a minute in order to get the data. They do so to maintain their competitive edge.
Hence, you need to think about what frequency you want and quote accordingly. For example, if you request for one call/minute, they will update data only after every minute.
Latency üöÑ
Some latency might follow in-between data updates. The delay can range from some milliseconds to seconds.
Hence, before you buy an API, make sure you clear this aspect; otherwise, they can sneak some data, and you will never know.
Now, it‚Äôs time to find some of the stock market APIs in the next section!
Marketstack
