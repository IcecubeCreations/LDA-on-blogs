            Top Big Data service providers in the world










Forbes states that 95% of businesses report the need to manage unstructured data as a significant problem for them. So, no wonder that there is a soaring demand for quality Big Data professionals, especially within the relevant domain expertise. But how to choose the Big Data service provider that fits your specific business needs and can become your strategic partner? 
We have compiled a list of top providers of Big Data consulting firms to help you make a well-grounded decision. 
Methodology:
We have researched Big Data service providers from several points of view. We have considered their years of experience, customer reviews, rankings (4,7-5) on the directories, including Clutch.co, Manifest, and Goodfirms.
What’s more, we have browsed through their portfolios, websites, and LinkedIn profiles to help you make an informed decision and choose the best Big Data service provider.
We have researched the best Big Data service providers worldwide, so our list covers different locations (Eastern Europe, USA, UK, Latin America, India). 
Here is the list of the best Big Data service providers that 1) focus mainly on Big Data and 2) offer wide-ranging expertise in Big Data, BI, Cloud Solutions, DevOps, Embedded, and more.
How to choose the best Big Data service provider?
There are some selection criteria that will be useful for you while choosing Big Data service providers that will meet your specific business requirements best. 


Location


Businesses report the lack of Big Data professionals, which hampers the results of Big Data adoption. So, it is vital to choose a location with a large talent pool and low to medium competition for it. For instance, the competition for Big Data experts in the USA and UK is fierce, so it is a serious challenge to find talent promptly. 
In comparison, the number of Data Scientists and Big Data engineers in Eastern Europe exceeds 150,000, according to Linkedin. What’s even more important is that there are no tech giants such as Amazon and Google, which usually allure the best talent.

Comprehensive expertise 


Choose Data analytics consulting companies with versatile expertise, including Big Data, BI, Machine Learning/AI, Cloud Solutions, DevOps, Security, migration to microservices, etc., to cover different needs. Look for Big Data service providers that can help you not only launch your Big Data direction but also scale it efficiently and integrate smoothly into your operations.


Portfolio


Choose Big Data service providers that have an extensive client portfolio. Check the projects these Big Data consulting firms were engaged in, as well as the reviews of the previous clients. 
Also, your Big Data consulting company should have experience in working with clients in different industry domains.
All in all, it is reasonable to choose an established and well-structured yet agile and flexible Big Data services companies that can quickly respond to your needs. To learn more about the vendor selection criteria to consider in 2020 and beyond - check out our article.
