In February 2016, I presented a brand new talk at OOP in Munich: “Comparison of Frameworks and Tools for Big Data Log Analytics and IT Operations Analytics”.  The focus of the talk is to discuss different open source frameworks,  SaaS cloud offerings and enterprise products for analyzing big masses of  distributed log events. This topic is getting much more traction these  days with the emerging architecture concept of Microservices.Key Take-AwaysLog Analytics enables IT Operations Analytics for Machine DataCorrelation of Events is the Key for Added Business ValueLog Management is complementary to other Big Data ComponentsLog Management with Papertrail, ELK Stack, TIBCO LogLogic, Splunk, etc.Log Management has been a mature concept for many years; used for  troubleshooting, root cause analysis, and solving security issues of  devices such as web servers, firewalls, routers, databases, etc. In the  meantime, it is also used for analyzing applications and distributed  deployments using SOA or Microservices architectures.The slide deck compares different solutions for log management:SaaS Cloud, e.g. Papertrail, Loggly, Sumo LogicOpen Source Frameworks, e.g. ELK stack (Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana), GraylogEnterprise Products, e.g. TIBCO LogLogic, IBM QRadar, SplunkIT Operations Analytics (ITOA) with TIBCO UnityIT Operations Analytics is a new, very young market growing strongly  (100% year-by-year, according to Gartner). In contrary to Log  Management, it does not just focus on analyzing historical data, but  also enables to make complex correlations of distributed data to allow  predictive analytics in (near) real time. TIBCO Unity  is a product heading into this direction. You can integrate log data,  but also real time events (e.g. via TIBCO Hawk) to enable monitoring,  analysis and complex correlation of distributed Microserices.What about Apache Hadoop versus Log Management and ITOA?Why not use just Apache Hadoop? You can also store and analyze all  data on its cluster! Why not just use Log Collectors (such as Apache  Flume) and send data directly to Hadoop without Log Analytics “in the  middle”?Here are some reasons… Log Management and ITOA tools.Are an integrated solution for data analysis (tooling, consulting, support).Are built exactly for these use cases.Involve data indexing, data processing (querying) and data visualization by means of dashboards and other tools out-of-the-box.Offer easy-of-use tooling and allow fast time-to-market / low TCO.The following graphic shows the different concepts and when they are usually used:Having said that, a better Hadoop integration is possible! It might make sense to leverage both together: the great  tooling for Log Management, plus the Hadoop storage with very high  scalability for really BIG data. For example, TIBCO Unity uses Apache  Kafka under the hood to support processing and scaling millions of  messages. Thus, integration with Hadoop storage might be possible in a  future release… SlidesFinally, here is my slide deck:Framework and Product Comparison for Big Data Log Analytics and ITOA  from Kai WähnerAs always, I appreciate any questions or feedback!
