As organizations are connecting to applications outside of their four walls, they risk becoming fragmented. Moreover, existing on-premise systems, such as AS/400 and ERPs, need to be able to communicate both internally and externally. Businesses are taking the “best of breed” approach, implementing specific applications and services to manage certain departments within their enterprise. Though this approach provides businesses with powerful tools to run their enterprise, it presents them with the challenge of integration. What is Middleware?And what does it do?Middleware technologies are often employed to eliminate the pain of integration. A middleware solution is essentially a layer between two systems that makes it easy for the two to communicate. It can be considered the glue that holds together applications, making seamless connectivity possible without requiring the two applications to communicate directly. In a highly distributed environment in which businesses need to connect with legacy systems, cloud and SaaS applications, and business management software such as SAP and Salesforce, the role of a middleware technology is critical.Legacy systems are of great importance to established businesses, as a large sum of critical data resides within them. Despite being inflexible, legacy systems are a significant part of a business, thus stability, scalability, interoperability, and secure communication is necessary. Moreover, as technology changes, the number of and types of devices (mobile, laptops, tablets, etc) running within a business environment increases as well, giving businesses yet another challenge to overcome. Lastly, the emergence of SaaS vendors has made it much easier for organizations to take a “best of breed” approach. Businesses can employ services from vendors such as Salesforce.com and Jobvite, who are leaders in CRM and recruiting solutions, to manage specific areas of their enterprise. As cloud computing increases in popularity, it also revolutionizes middleware and the role of integration. In order for a business to run efficiently and effectively, a middleware connectivity solution is needed to enable connectivity throughout the enterprise, on-premise and in the cloud.Mule as an ESB, a middleware solutionMuleSoft provides a middleware solution to help businesses overcome the challenges of integration.
