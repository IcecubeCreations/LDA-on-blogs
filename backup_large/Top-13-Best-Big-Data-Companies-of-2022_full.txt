Top 13 Best Big Data Companies of 2022 

Last Updated:May 6, 2022 






Overview of Big Data:
Over the past few years, you must have heard the term “Big Data” which is defined in different ways.
Big Data describes the large volume of data in a structured and unstructured manner. The data belongs to a different organization and each organization uses such data for different purposes. So a large amount of data is not critical, the rather critical part is how organizations are using this data. 
Big Data is a data set that is huge and complex so that traditional data processing applications are inadequate to deal with them. There are challenges to managing such a huge volume of data such as capture, store, data analysis, data transfer, data sharing, etc. Big Data follows the 3V model as “High Volume”, “High Velocity” and “High Variety”.
The importance of Big Data is not about how much volume of data is present rather it is focused on what you do with that data.





In today’s world, by collecting data you can find answers for – root cause for failure, recalculating the risk profiles, etc. It also helps to reduce cost, faster decision making. Hadoop technology and cloud-based analytics help business analyze the information or data immediately so decision making is much faster.
