Top 18 Data Ingestion Tools


One of the key challenges faced by modern companies is the huge volume of data from numerous data sources. We are in the Big Data era where data is flooding in at unparalleled rates and it’s hard to collect and process this data without the appropriate data handling tools.
Choosing the appropriate tool is not an easy task, and it’s even more difficult to handle large volumes of data if the company is not aware of the available tools. Nevertheless, many contemporary companies that deal with substantial amounts of data utilize different types of tools to load and process data from various sources in an efficient and effective manner.
Data ingestion is one of the first steps of the data handling process. With the right data ingestion tools, companies can quickly collect, import, process, and store data from different data sources.
What are the Top Data Ingestion Tools: Apache Kafka, Apache NIFI, Wavefront, DataTorrent, Amazon Kinesis, Apache Storm, Syncsort, Gobblin, Apache Flume, Apache Sqoop, Apache Samza, Fluentd, Wavefront, Cloudera Morphlines, White Elephant, Apache Chukwa, Heka, Scribe and Databus are some of the Data Ingestion Tools.
What are Data Ingestion Tools?
The process of importing, transferring, loading and processing data for later use or storage in a database is called Data ingestion and this involves loading data from a variety of sources, altering and modification of individual files and formatting them to fit into a larger document.
Data ingestion can be continuous, asynchronous, real-time or batched and the source and the destination may also have different format or protocol, which will require some type of transformation or conversion.
Data ingestion tools provide a framework that allows companies to collect, import, load, transfer, integrate, and process data from a wide range of data sources. They facilitate the data extraction process by supporting various data transport protocols.
In addition to gathering, integrating, and processing data, data ingestion tools help companies to modify and format the data for analytics and storage purposes. With these tools, users can ingest data in batches or stream it in real time. Real-time data ingestion means importing the data as it is produced by the source. On the other hand, ingesting data in batches means importing discrete chunks of data at intervals.
Companies that use data ingestion tools need to prioritize data sources, validate each file, and dispatch data items to the right destination to ensure an effective ingestion process. Although some companies develop their own tools, most companies utilize data ingestion tools developed by experts in data integration.
Top Data Ingestion Tools

Data Extraction and Processing: The main objective of data ingestion tools is to extract data and that’s why data extraction is an extremely important feature. As mentioned earlier, data ingestion tools use different data transport protocols to collect, integrate, process, and deliver data to the appropriate destinations.
Dataflow Visualization: This feature allows users to visualize dataflow. A simple drag-and-drop interface makes it possible to visualize complex data and find an effective way to simplify the data.
Scalability: The most effective data ingestion tools can scale to accommodate different data sizes and meet the processing needs of the organization because they are designed for extension. This is possible because users can configure nodes to increase the number of transactions or parallel tasks performed by the processor.
Multi-platform Support and Integration: Another important feature is the ability to extract all types of data from multiple data sources in the cloud or on premises. Data ingestion tools can regularly access data from different types of databases and operating systems without impacting the performance of these systems.
Advanced Security Features: The best data ingestion tools utilize various data encryption mechanisms and security protocols such as SSL, HTTPS, and SSH to secure company data.

Some of the benefits include:

Rapid extraction and delivery of data.
The ability to scale makes it possible to handle huge amounts of data.
Cost-effective solutions.
User-friendly interface for unskilled users.

Apache Samza



Apache Samza is a distributed stream processing framework. It uses Apache Kafka for messaging, and Apache Hadoop YARN to provide fault tolerance, processor isolation, security, and resource management. Unlike most low-level messaging system APIs, Samza provides a very simple callback-based “process message” API comparable to MapReduce. Samza manages snapshotting and restoration of a stream processor’s state. When the processor is restarted, Samza restores its state to a consistent snapshot. Samza is built to handle large amounts of state (many gigabytes per partition). Whenever a machine in the cluster fails, Samza works with YARN to transparently migrate your tasks to another…

What are Data Ingestion Tools? 

						The process of importing, transferring, loading and processing data for later use or storage in a database is called Data ingestion and this involves loading data from a variety of sources, altering and modification of individual files and formatting them to fit into a larger document. Data ingestion can be continuous, asynchronous, real-time or batched and the source and the destination may also have different format or protocol, which will require some type of transformation or conversion.
