Best Log Management Tools: Useful Tools for Log Management, Monitoring, Analytics, and More
 Alexandra Altvater May 26, 2017 Developer Tips, Tricks & Resources




Gone are the days of painful plain-text log management. While plain-text data is still useful in certain situations, when it comes to doing extended analysis to gather insightful infrastructure data – and improve the quality of your code – it pays to invest in reliable log management tools and systems that can empower your business workflow.
Logs are not an easy thing to deal with, but regardless is an important aspect of any production system. When you are faced with a difficult issue, it’s much easier to use a log management tool than it is to weave through endless loops of text-files spread throughout your system environment.
Try Stackify’s free code profiler, Prefix, to write better code on your workstation. Prefix works with .NET, Java, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, and Python. 
The big advantage of log management tools is that they can help you easily pinpoint the root cause of any application or software error, within a single query. The same applies to security-related concerns, where many of the following tools are capable of helping your IT team prevent attacks even before they happen. Another factor is having a visual overview of how your software is being used globally by your user base — getting all this crucial data in one single dashboard is going to make your productivity rise substantially.
When picking the right log management tool for your needs, evaluate your current business operation.  Decide on whether you’re still a small operation looking to get the basic data out of your logs, or you plan to enter the enterprise level – which will require more powerful logging system and efficient tools to tackle large scale log management. 
We built Retrace to address the need for a cohesive, comprehensive developer tool that combines APM, errors, logs, metrics, and monitoring in a single dashboard. When it comes to log management tools, they run the gamut from stand-alone tools to robust solutions that integrate with your other go-to tools, analytics, and more. We put together this list of 52 useful log management tools (listed below in no particular order) to provide an easy reference for anyone wanting to compare the current offerings to find a solution that best meets your needs.
