Decompose your monolith: Ten principles for refactoring a monolith to microservices
I recently gave a  presentation at the DDD SoCal.
The presentation is an expanded version of my CTO Summit talk and describes an additional 4 principles:


Make the most of your monolith
Adopt microservices for the right reasons
Itâs not just architecture
Get the support of the business
Migrate incrementally
Know your starting point
Begin with the end in mind
Migrate high-value modules first
Success is improved velocity and reliability
If it hurts, donât do it

Here are the slides and the video.

Note: the video doesnât include the first couple of slides. You also need to skip over the part where my Mac crashed :-).
