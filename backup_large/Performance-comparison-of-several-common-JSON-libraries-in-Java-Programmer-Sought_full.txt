Performance comparison of several common JSON libraries in Java










SON is a fairly common data transfer format in web development or server development. In general, we don't need to care too much about the performance of JSON parsing constructs, except in systems with higher performance requirements.
At present, there are many kinds of JSON class libraries for Java open source. Below we take 4 commonly used JSON libraries for performance test comparison. At the same time, according to the test results, we can select the most suitable JSON library according to the actual application scenario.
The four JSON class libraries are: Gson, FastJson, Jackson, Json-lib.
basic introduction
Choosing a suitable JSON library is considered in several ways:

String parsing into JSON performance
String parsing into JavaBean performance
JavaBean constructs JSON performance
Collection constructs JSON performance
Ease of use

Briefly introduce the identity background of the next four libraries.
Gson
project address:https://github.com/google/gson
Gson is currently the most versatile Json parsing artifact. Gson was originally developed by Google in response to Google's internal needs, but has been used by many companies or users since the first release in May 2008. Gson's application is mainly toJson and fromJson two conversion functions, no dependencies, no need for an extra jar, can run directly on the JDK. Before using this object transformation, you must first create the type of the object and its members to successfully convert the JSON string into the corresponding object. As long as there are get and set methods in the class, Gson can completely implement complex type json to bean or bean to json conversion, which is an artifact of JSON parsing.
FastJson
project address:https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson
Fastjson is a high-performance JSON processor written in the Java language developed by Alibaba. No dependencies, no extra jars are required, and you can run directly on the JDK. FastJson will have some problems on the complex type of bean transformation Json, there may be a type of reference, resulting in Json conversion error, need to make a reference. FastJson uses the original algorithm to maximize the speed of the parse, exceeding all json libraries.
Jackson
project address:https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson
Jackson is a widely used Java open source framework for serializing and deserializing json. The Jackson community is relatively active and faster to update. From the statistics in Github, Jackson is one of the most popular json parsers. Spring MVC's default json parser is Jackson.
Jackson has many advantages:

Jackson relies on fewer jars and is easy to use.
Compared to other Java json frameworks, Gson, etc., Jackson parses large json files faster.
Jackson runs with less memory and better performance
Jackson has a flexible API that can be easily extended and customized.

The latest version is 2.9.4, and Jackson's core module consists of three parts:

The Jackson-core core package provides APIs based on "streaming mode" parsing, including JsonPaser and JsonGenerator. The Jackson internal implementation generates and parses json through the JsonGenerator and JsonParser of the high-performance streaming mode API.
The Jackson-annotations annotation package provides standard annotations;
The Jackson-databind data binding package provides related APIs (ObjectMapper) based on "object binding" parsing and related APIs parsed by "tree model" (JsonNode); API and "tree model" parsing based on "object binding" parsing The API relies on an API based on "streaming mode" parsing.

Why is Jackson's introduction so long? Because it is also my favorite.
Json-lib
project address:http://json-lib.sourceforge.net/index.html
Json-lib is also the most widely used json parsing tool. json-lib is not a bad place to rely on many third-party packages. For complex type conversions, json-lib has defects in converting json into beans, such as There will be a list or map collection of another class in a class, and the conversion of json-lib from json to bean will cause problems. Json-lib can't meet the needs of the current Internet in terms of functions and performance.
Write performance tests
Next, start writing the performance test code for these four libraries.
Add maven dependencies
Of course, the first is to add maven dependencies for the four libraries. To be fair, I use all of their latest versions:

Prepare the Model class
Here I write a simple Person class, with attributes such as Date, List, Map, and a custom class FullName to maximize the real scene.

Explain, in the above code

  ResultExporter.exportResult("JSON Serialization Performance", results, "count", "Second");
 



This is my own method of filling the performance test report data into the Echarts diagram, and then exporting the png image. I will not post the specific code. Refer to my github source code.
Result graph after execution:

From the above test results, Gson performance is the best when the serialization times are small. When it increases, it reaches 100000. Gson is weaker than Jackson and FastJson. At this time, FastJson performance is real, and you can also Seeing that the number is small or not, Jackson has always performed well. And that Json-lib is simply funny. ^_^

Result graph after execution:

As can be seen from the above test results, when deserialization, Gson, Jackson and FastJson have little difference, and the performance is excellent, and the Json-lib still continues to be funny.
