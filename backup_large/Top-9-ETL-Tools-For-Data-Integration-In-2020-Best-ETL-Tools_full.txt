One of the essential aspects of data warehousing is the ETL (Extract Transform Load) tool. An ETL tool is a combination of three different functions in a single tool. One most crucial property of ETL is to transform the heterogeneous data into homogeneous one, which later helps data scientists to gain meaningful insights from the data. 
In this article, we list down the top 9 ETL tools one must use for data integration in 2020.
