The Big Data market is enjoying dramatic growth, based on the surging interest in the competitive advantage offered by Big Data analytics. Indeed, Big Data software is still in sharp growth mode, with big advances in predictive analytics tools and data mining tools, along with next-gen artificial intelligence.
In short, data analytics runs the world. Even as you read this, teams at companies across the world are peering at data analytics software tools.
The Big Data industry itself is the very picture of swirling change. New companies, new products, new approaches and methodologies – change is a constant. Big Data startups are looking for a piece of the pie, doing their best to steal market share from the blue chip companies that won the business intelligence software market.
So, which tools and platforms should you choose? Here are 25 of the top Big Data companies to consider in the Big Data world.
Please note: This list is not a ranking. The companies on this list serve different aspects of the market, making ranking them in any order beyond revenue impossible and unfair.

Big Data companies are forecast to see dramatic revenue increases in the years ahead.
Big Data Companies: The Big Data Leaders
Snowflake

Touting itself as “intelligent software engineering,” the company works across a variety of sectors, from pure technology to consulting services. Intellias has had success leveraging Big Data in location-based services and geospatial initiatives – definitely a growing market as IoT lays sensors across an ever widening area. The company has also done data analytics projects for gaming, which suggests that it understands the needs of the consumer market.
Visual BI Solutions
Visual BI offers cloud-based or in-house business intelligence software that enables easy-to-understand visualizations of a company’s data trends. In fact, the company lives up to its name: if you want a colorful, visual representation of your data, that’s exactly what Visual BI is geared for: bar charts, tables, line graphs – the company’s solution represents data visually in plenty of different ways. The product is considered a good value for the money. Targeting some of the more commonly used platforms, Visual BI has products designed for Microsoft Power BI and SAP business intelligence software. That is, Visual BI offers custom visual extensions to these SAP and Microsoft BI platforms. |For custom support, Visual BI maintains a global help desk.
Salesforce
Salesforce, the king of SaaS, became a data analytics software vendor when it announced plans to purchase Tableau Systems, a data visualization firm that has expanded from its original mission to include Big Data research. It offers visualization of data from any source, from Hadoop to Excel files. Salesforce has its own Big Data tools in joined reports, which lets customers compare different data sets in the hopes of getting insights from customer data.
