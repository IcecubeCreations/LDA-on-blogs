To make the most of it, we recommend using these popular open source Big Data solutions for each stage of data processing.Why opting for open source Big Data tools and not for proprietary solutions, you might ask? The reason became obvious over the last decade — open sourcing the software is the way to make it popular.Developers prefer to avoid vendor lock-in and tend to use free tools for the sake of versatility, as well as due to the possibility to contribute to the evolvement of their beloved platform. Open source products boast the same, if not better level of documentation depth, along with a much more dedicated support from the community, who are also the product developers and Big Data practitioners, who know what they need from a product. Thus said, this is the list of 8 hot Big Data tool to use in 2018, based on popularity, feature richness and usefulness.1. Apache HadoopThe long-standing champion in the field of Big Data processing, well-known for its capabilities for huge-scale data processing. This open source Big Data framework can run on-prem or in the cloud and has quite low hardware requirements. The main Hadoop benefits and features are as follows:HDFS — Hadoop Distributed File System, oriented at working with huge-scale bandwidthMapReduce — a highly configurable model for Big Data processingYARN — a resource scheduler for Hadoop resource managementHadoop Libraries — the needed glue for enabling third party modules to work with Hadoop2. Apache SparkApache Spark is the alternative — and in many aspects the successor — of Apache Hadoop. Spark was built to address the shortcomings of Hadoop and it does this incredibly well. For example, it can process both batch data and real-time data, and operates 100 times faster than MapReduce. Spark provides the in-memory data processing capabilities, which is way faster than disk processing leveraged by MapReduce. In addition, Spark works with HDFS, OpenStack and Apache Cassandra, both in the cloud and on-prem, adding another layer of versatility to big data operations for your business.3. Apache StormStorm is another Apache product, a real-time framework for data stream processing, which supports any programming language. Storm scheduler balances the workload between multiple nodes based on topology configuration and works well with Hadoop HDFS. Apache Storm has the following benefits:Great horizontal scalabilityBuilt-in fault-toleranceAuto-restart on crashesClojure-writtenWorks with Direct Acyclic Graph(DAG) topologyOutput files are in JSON format4. Apache CassandraApache Cassandra is one of the pillars behind Facebook’s massive success, as it allows to process structured data sets distributed across huge number of nodes across the globe. It works well under heavy workloads due to its architecture without single points of failure and boasts unique capabilities no other NoSQL or relational DB has, such as:Great liner scalabilitySimplicity of operations due to a simple query language usedConstant replication across nodesSimple adding and removal of nodes from a running clusterHigh fault toleranceBuilt-in high-availability5. MongoDBMongoDB is another great example of an open source NoSQL database with rich features, which is cross-platform compatible with many programming languages. IT Svit uses MongoDB in a variety of cloud computing and monitoring solutions, and we specifically developed a module for automated MongoDB backups using Terraform. The most prominent MongoDB features are:Stores any type of data, from text and integer to strings, arrays, dates and booleanCloud-native deployment and great flexibility of configurationData partitioning across multiple nodes and data centersSignificant cost savings, as dynamic schemas enable data processing on the go6. R Programming EnvironmentR is mostly used along with JuPyteR stack (Julia, Python, R) for enabling wide-scale statistical analysis and data visualization. JupyteR Notebook is one of 4 most popular Big Data visualization tools, as it allows composing literally any analytical model from more than 9,000 CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network) algorithms and modules, running it in a convenient environment, adjusting it on the go and inspecting the analysis results at once. The main benefits of using R are as follows:R can run inside the SQL serverR runs on both Windows and Linux serversR supports Apache Hadoop and SparkR is highly portableR easily scales from a single test machine to vast Hadoop data lakes7. Neo4jNeo4j is an open source graph database with interconnected node-relationship of data, which follows the key-value pattern in storing data. IT Svit has recently built a resilient AWS infrastructure with Neo4j for one of our customers and the database performs well under heavy workload of network data and graph-related requests. Main Neo4j features are as follows:Built-in support for ACID transactionsCypher graph query languageHigh-availability and scalabilityFlexibility due to the absence of schemasIntegration with other databases8. Apache SAMOAThis is another of the Apache family of tools used for Big Data processing. Samoa specializes at building distributed streaming algorithms for successful Big Data mining. This tool is built with pluggable architecture and must be used atop other Apache products like Apache Storm we mentioned earlier. Its other features used for Machine Learning include the following:ClusteringClassificationNormalizationRegressionProgramming primitives for building custom algorithmsUsing Apache Samoa enables the distributed stream processing engines to provide such tangible benefits:Program once, use anywhereReuse the existing infrastructure for new projectsNo reboot or deployment downtimeNo need for backups or time-consuming updatesFinal thoughts on the list of hot Big Data tools for 2018Big Data industry and data science evolve rapidly and progressed a big deal lately, with multiple Big Data projects and tools launched in 2017. This is one of the hottest IT trends of 2018, along with IoT, blockchain, AI & ML.Big Data analytics is increasingly widespread in multiple industries, from using ML in banking and financial services to healthcare and government, and open source Big Data tools are the mainframe of any Big Data architect’s toolkit. In case you have any difficulties with Big Data implementation — don’t hesitate to contact IT Svit, we would be glad to help!------More from Vladimir FedakFollowDevOps & Big Data loverLove podcasts or audiobooks?
