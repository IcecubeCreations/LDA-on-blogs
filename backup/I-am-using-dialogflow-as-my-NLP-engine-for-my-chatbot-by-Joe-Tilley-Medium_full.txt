I would like to store the conversation to later run some statistical modeling (not in real-time) for later analysis of the data.I am thinking about storing the data using a lamda function and dynamoDB but the implementation is less important to me as I would like to use the proper architecture to so I can better solve my use case (storing conversations and analyzing the data at some point—not in realtime)I am open to any implementation and curious as to what you would suggest for this use case.As I understand it you suggest using a message broker like a RabbitMQ or Kafka in between my bot and data store to queue all messages first and then load them into the database in batches?Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks again for this article as it has made me think of my design a little differently.Best,Joe--1----1More from Joe TilleyFollowMission-driven Product Leader | TechnologistLove podcasts or audiobooks?
