Processing JSON in automation scripts in IBM Control Desk 7.6






Background
You may need to deal with JSON-formatted data in an automation script, and it can be a little tricky. I've written this post to provide the few little pointers to make it easier for you.

JavaScript

You can write automation scripts in Rhino JavaScript or Jython. While Jython is the most common language used for automation scripts, it turns out that JSON processing is MUCH easier in JavaScript. Specifically, in a JavaScript automation script, you have access to the popular object named JSON that will give you everything you need. Here's an example:



var jsonObject = JSON.parse(jsonString);



And that's it. You can now work with jsonObject as a JSON object as described in this reference material from w3schools:



https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_parse.asp



As far as I know, this will work in both WebSphere and WebLogic application servers. One possible caveat is that the JavaScript engine is changing from JDK 7 to JDK 8. Here's more information on that:



http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21992706

Jython in WebSphere

For Maximo/ICD automation scripts, Jython is by far the most popular language. It's also more thoroughly documented and, IMO, easier to work with in this context. However, JSON parsing has a couple of caveats. Specifically, the Jython interpreter in ICD 7.6 is version 2.5.2, which doesn't have a built-in JSON parser (one was added in Jython version 2.6). However, we're still in luck because WebSphere actually includes a JAR file that provides JSON processing. The specific class that you need to import is com.ibm.json.java.JSONObject :



from com.ibm.json.java import JSONObject

...

my_json = JSONObject.parse(my_filebody)



And from there, you can deal with my_json appropriately according to the JavaDoc here:



https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEUEX_3.0.0/com.ibm.javaeuc.doc/com/ibm/json/java/JSONObject.html



Jython in WebLogic

Admittedly, I haven't tested this one. I've tested the above two, and from my research, I believe this will work. Specifically, these two links give the necessary information:



http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/json-1973242.html



https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1213/wls/WLPRG/java-api-for-json-proc.htm#WLPRG1059



If you find that it doesn't work, please ping me and I'll help you get it to work then update this entry as necessary.



With that in mind, you just need to import the appropriate classes in your automation script:



from javax.json import Json

from javax.json import JsonObject



And there you go.
