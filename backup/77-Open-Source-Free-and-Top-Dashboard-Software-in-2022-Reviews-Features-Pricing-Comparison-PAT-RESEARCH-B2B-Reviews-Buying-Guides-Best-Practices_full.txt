ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONThere’s a lot of great software listed here, we use a few of them already but you will also want a tool to actually display all these pretty dashboards on the walls and screens around your office and further allow you to manage them.  You’re not making the most of all this data if it’s not visible to everyone. 
I would suggest adding Vue Pilot – vuepilot.com  to this listing of products which takes care of displaying dashboards produced by all these tools on screens and TV’s around your work place and provides you with an interface to remotely manage your screens from a central dashboard.  
Connect a PC to multiple screens and display a different collections of dashboards on each one,  update screens in remote offices with the latest sales or management dashboards without leaving your desk.   Its a pretty handy
