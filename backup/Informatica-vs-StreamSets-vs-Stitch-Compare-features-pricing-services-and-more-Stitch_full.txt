AboutFeatures tableTransformationsData sources and destinationsSupport, documentation, and trainingPricingMost businesses have data stored in a variety of locations, from in-house databases to SaaS platforms. To get a full picture of their finances and operations, they pull data from all those sources into a data warehouse or data lake and run analytics against it. But they don't want to build and maintain their own data pipelines.Fortunately, it’s not necessary to code everything in-house. Here's an comparison of two such tools, head to head.About InformaticaInformatica offers a portfolio of data integration products as well as tools for master data management, data quality, data cataloging, and API management. Informatica started out with on-premises tools but now offers a cloud platform as well.

Informatica includes a library of prebuilt transformations and the ability to build custom transformations using a proprietary transformation language.
StreamSetsStreamSets comes with more than 50 pre-load transformation processors, which users can drag and drop onto a graphical workspace. Processors can look up, remove, convert, parse, and aggregate data from various sources. Developers can write their own custom processors in Java, Java Expression Language (EL), JavaScript, Jython, Groovy, and Scala.StitchStitch is an ELT product. Within the pipeline, Stitch does only transformations that are required for compatibility with the destination, such as translating data types or denesting data when relevant. Stitch is part of Talend, which also provides tools for transforming data either within the data warehouse or via external processing engines such as Spark and MapReduce. Transformations can be defined in SQL, Python, Java, or via graphical user interface.Try Stitch for free for 14 daysUnlimited data volume during trialSet up in minutesSign up for free →Contact Sales →Set up in minutesUnlimited data volume during trialNo credit card requiredConnectors: Data sources and destinationsEach of these tools supports a variety of data sources and destinations.InformaticaInformatica provides Cloud Connectors for more than 100 applications and databases.
