The Swiss army knife of log management
With syslog-ng, you can collect logs from any source, process them in real time and deliver them to a wide variety of destinations. syslog-ng allows you to collect, parse, classify, rewrite and correlate logs from across your infrastructure and store or route them to log analysis tools.
(Note: syslog-ng Open Source Edition does not use the affected versions of Apache Log4j, therefore it is not impacted by CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-4104, CVE-2021-45015.)

Key features




Highlights
Organizations use syslog-ng to reliably and securely collect, process and normalize log messages from across their IT environments, and forward them to Big Data stores and log analytics or store them in an encrypted log store.










Open source

Released under a combination of the GNU General Public License (GPL) and Lesser General Public License (LGPL) - contributor agreement not required. Developed in the open: code, issues, mailing list all available!






Extensible


syslog-ng can be extended with plugins to suit any use case. Tools and modules can be written in C, Python, Java, Lua, or Perl.














Additional Features





Support for common inputs

syslog-ng not only supports legacy BSD syslog (RFC3164) and the enhanced RFC5424 protocols but also JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and journald message formats.


Flexible data extraction
Working with unstructured data? That's not a problem: syslog-ng comes with a set of built-in parsers, which you can combine to build very complex things.


Message queue support
syslog-ng supports the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and the Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) too, with more in the pipeline.




Simplify complex log data
Even if you need to collect logs from a diverse range of sources, syslog-ng's patterndb allows you to correlate events together and transform them into a unified format.


Databases destinations
If you need to store your log messages in a database, you don't need to look any further! We have SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, even Oracle!),MongoDB. We also support inserting messages into Redis, if that's what you are after.
