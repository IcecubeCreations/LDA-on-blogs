Types of Middleware
Application infrastructure middleware (AIM) is software that acts as an intermediary between other applications or devices. AIM is used in the context of public, hybrid, or private cloud computing for cloud enablement of existing and new applications. For example, it is possible to turn existing custom applications into Software as a Service applications with all the complex software architecture handled by platform middleware. One of the best ways to understand middleware is to look at specific examples that weren’t built for the cloud, but which many cloud services currently incorporate. These examples include:
Message Oriented Middleware
This type of middleware is an infrastructure that supports the receiving and sending of messages over distributed applications. It enables applications to be disbursed over various platforms and makes the process of creating software applications spanning many operating systems and network protocols much less complicated. It holds many advantages over middleware alternatives (e.g. hard coding logic) and is one of the most widely used types of middleware.
Object Middleware
Object middleware, also called an object request broker, gives applications the ability to send objects and request services via an object oriented system. In short, it manages the communication between objects.

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Middleware
An RPC is exactly what it sounds like. It calls procedures on remote systems and is used to perform synchronous or asynchronous interactions between applications or systems. It is usually utilized within a software application.
Database Middleware
This type of middleware allows for direct access to databases, providing direct interaction with them. There are many database gateways and connectivity options. You simply have to see what will work best for your necessary solution. This is the most general and commonly known type of middleware. This includes SQL database software.
Transaction Middleware
This type of middleware includes applications like transaction processing monitors. It also encompasses web-application servers. These types of middleware are becoming more and more common today.
Portals
This refers to enterprise portal servers. It is considered middleware because portals facilitate front-end integration. They are used to create interactions between a user’s computer or device and back-end systems and services.
Embedded Middleware
This type of middleware allows for communication and integration services with an interface of software or firmware. It acts as a liaison between embedded applications and the real-time operating system.
Content-Centric Middleware
This type of middleware allows you to abstract specific content without worrying how it is obtained. This is done through a simple provide / consume abstraction. It is similar to publish / subscribe middleware, which is another type of this software that is often used as a part of web-based applications.
