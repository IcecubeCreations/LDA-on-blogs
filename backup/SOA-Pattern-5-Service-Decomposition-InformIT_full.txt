A service inventory is a living body of services that individually will need the

freedom to evolve independently over time. What we learned when documenting the

SOA design pattern catalog is that there are patterns that emerged not only at

design-time but also during this post-implementation evolutionary stage in a

service‚Äôs lifecycle.
There is one common scenario that repeatedly surfaced in many projects:

When we model and design services during early stages of SOA adoption we are

constrained by current infrastructure and technology. These constraints require

that we limit the size of service compositions and the extent of cross-service

message exchanges. As a result, each service encompasses more logic and is

coarser grained.
Our infrastructure improves over time (because of new platform upgrades or new

funding for better hardware, etc.). Our existing service compositions are

comprised of coarse-grained services that were delivered within the parameters

of the older environment. However, we now realize that services could be more

fine grained (and could perform and be composed more effectively) because the

infrastructure can support larger service compositions.

It is in response to this situation that the Service

Decomposition pattern provides a technique for splitting up a service after its initial deployment into two or

more fine-grained services.
Of course, such an approach will raise a few eyebrows from those involved in

version control and change management. How can we break apart a service with an

established contract without impacting all of the consumer programs that have

been using the service and have formed very real runtime dependencies on how it

currently exists?
To address these issues, the Service

Decomposition pattern needs the help of several other SOA design patterns:

Proxy

Capability ‚Äì When logic is moved from one service to another, this pattern can be used to preserve the

original capability that is expressed as part of the original service‚Äôs contract.
Service

Fa√ßade ‚Äì In support of enabling Proxy Capability, this multi-purpose

pattern can be used to establish (within the original service logic) a fa√ßade layer of processing that acts as a liaison between the original

service and the new service. The fa√ßade component may actually invoke the corresponding capability on the newly created service, thereby acting as its

service consumer on behalf of the consumer of the original service.
When applying these two patterns together with Service

Decomposition, the fa√ßade logic can also be designed to compensate for a change in behavior that is likely to occur as a result of physically moving a segment of the original service logic into a new location.

An important requirement for the decomposition of a service to be successful is

that the resulting, more fine-grained services have distinct functional

contexts. When modeling and designing these new services, all applicable

service-orientation principles and patterns must be considered as with any other

new service. Other fundamental patterns, such as Service Normalization, also

need to be applied to ensure that the new services properly line up with the

others in the existing service inventory.
One common problem with post-implementation service decomposition, however, is that

a given set of capabilities may not correspond cleanly to the functional

contexts of the new services. What this means is that a new service may only

require a portion of what the original service capability

represents.
There are several ways of dealing with this, including a hybrid application of the

Proxy

Capability pattern where the original service retains some of its logic but then still calls a new service

for the portion that now belongs elsewhere. However, there is yet another pattern we can take into account early on during the initial modeling stages of

the original service in anticipation of future decomposition requirements. This pattern is called Decomposed Capability and it essentially asks us to think ahead as to how a given coarse-grained service context can be split into multiple finer-grained contexts and to then align the initial service capabilities correspondingly.
