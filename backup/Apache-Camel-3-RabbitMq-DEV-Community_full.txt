              Apache Camel #3 - RabbitMq

Hello there again!
It passed 2 months since my last article, so I decided to write a new one.
Today we will focus on RabbitMq and what we can do with it using Camel.
Dependencies
Maven repository -> Camel RabbitMq
Connection to RabbitMq
When using SpringBoot:

Create a class with @Configuration annotation.
Create a method which will return ConnectionFactory and annotate it with @Bean.
Instance a connection factory and set properties. 


@Bean
public ConnectionFactory rabbitConnectionFactory() {
    ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ConnectionFactory();
    connectionFactory.setHost("localhost);
    connectionFactory.setPort(5672);
    connectionFactory.setUsername("Username");
    connectionFactory.setPassword("Password);

    return connectionFactory;
}

*note: You can use application properties to connect to the server. 
If you are using pure Camel:

Using RabbitMq
Now that we successfully connected to RabbitMq it's time to start consuming/producing messages to queue/exchange.
Camel RabbitMq component documentation.
Consuming Message from the queue:

We will set the rabbitMq component to fetch from the queue which is bind to exchange.
Log message body received.

public void configure() {

from("rabbitmq:exchangeA?queue=QueueA&amp;declare=true")
.routeId("RabbiqMqConsumer")
.log("Message received: ${body}");

Producing Message to exchange:

We will create a route.
Set message body.
Send a message to the exchange.

public void configure() {

 from("timer:fooo?period=10000")
 .routeId("RabbiqMqProducer)
 .setBody().constant("{\"foo\":\"bar\"}")
 .log("Message to be sent: ${body}")
 .to("rabbitmq:exchangeB");

Aand that's all folks, if anyone have some question, feel free to ask me via DM or just leave a comment.
