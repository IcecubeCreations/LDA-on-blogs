Businesses today are trying all kinds of ways to get insights from their data faster. Not only is there a huge and growing amount of data but it also moves incredibly fast and comes from many different sources. Today there is a data-hungry workforce – everyone in a company wants access to data. There are more siloed data sources and systems than ever before – and you probably don’t have enough resources or build connectors for all your data sources.
If your business is data-driven you’re going to want modern ELT tools designed with modern needs in mind. With ELT tools, you don’t have to develop complex transformation processes and can save any type of information without having to transform and structure it first. This, in turn, saves data engineers and analysts time when ingesting new information. In this post, we will explore the top 10 ELT tools and aid your decision-making process.
This blog about ELT tools is a relatively detailed one. Use the navigation links below to instantly traverse to the required point.

ELT vs ETLTop 10 ELT Tools ComparisonHevo DataLuigiBlendoMatillionTalendStreamSetsEtleapAirflowKafkaNiFiCloud-native and Open Source ELT ToolsConclusion
ELT vs ETL
Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT) is a process that involves extracting data from disparate sources, loading it into a target datastore, typically a data warehouse and transforming it—performing such actions as changing the data types or applying calculations. ELT is a great choice for a business that wants to prioritize ingestion speed.
Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) is a process that involves extracting data from disparate sources, validating and transforming the data before loading it into a target data store. It is especially useful when there is no consistency in the data coming from the source systems which requires you to standardize (validate/transform) all the data coming in before loading into a database, usually an MPP Data Warehouse.
The distinction here is based on the order of events. In ETL you apply transformations on the data while it’s being moved while in an ELT context you are transforming the data after it has been moved to your data warehouse. ETL has the advantage of landing data in its finished and transformed state. But as the volume of data increases, the ability of the ETL tool to load the data in a timely fashion is compromised. In this scenario, ELT has the advantage of leveraging a target MPP database to drive transformations. 
As a developer, you probably hear a lot about new ELT tools and technologies that promise to increase the speed at which you can migrate data between different data stores, as well as ones that can increase the consistency of your data in transit. Your challenge is to wade through these emerging technologies and determine which ones actually can keep up with your specific requirements for the projects that you are currently working on.
No doubt, you are aware of the various ELT tools available in the market. However, you might not know about which tool can provide the best value to you and your projects. This article seeks to separate the wheat from the chaff and explores the different types of ELT tools available, and provides guidelines that can help you with real-world ELT pipelines. 
Now that we know what an ELT tool is, let’s have a peek at the list of top ELT tools and compare them.
Top 10 ELT Tools
Here’s a list of some of the top 10 tools available in the market for ELT, that you can choose from, to simplify ELT. Selecting the right tool for your business needs has never been this easy:

Drawbacks
It has limited integrations relative to most of the ELT tools reviewed in this list.
Pricing
The company does not disclose its pricing structure. To purchase the solution you need to have a conversation with a sales engineer. A free personalized trial is available but you will still need to request for it.
8. Airflow
Apache Airflow was developed by the engineering team at Airbnb and then later open-sourced to Apache. Airflow is typically used to create jobs, scheduling said jobs, and monitoring your ELT workflows/pipelines. An Airflow workflow is a sequence of tasks defined using the Python programming language. These tasks can be initiated on a schedule or even by an event. The pipeline can also send reports on the status of your pipelines using email and is one of the many ELT tools to do so. You can read more about Airflow here.
Features
Define Airflow pipelines in Python.Execute, schedule, and distribute tasks across worker nodes.Logging feature with a detailed view of present and past runs.Extensible through plugins.Used by more than 200 companies including – Yahoo! AirBnB, PayPal, Intel, Stripe, and Yahoo!
Best-suited use case
Airflow is one of the ELT Tools that are best suited for orchestrating complex data processing pipelines. If you require a custom data pipeline, then you can use Python to programmatically define your own custom operators, executors, monitors, etc for your ELT pipeline. You can monitor all ELT processes in the user-friendly UI that displays complex workflows as SVG images.
The solution is also highly scalable. You can use it in a single node and it is also possible to have a cluster of workers.
Drawbacks
A steep learning curve given the extensive UI and the non-trivial process of creating new connectors.If your use case has many long-running tasks then you might experience that the Airflow scheduler loop introduces significant latency. To avoid this you can use a Kubernetes executor to scale it to run thousands of concurrent workflows. The centralized nature of the Airflow scheduler introduces a single point of failure for the system.There is no support for dependency resolution and so tasks cannot communicate with each other.Creating custom hooks and operators adds additional operational overhead and takes away your focus from your core business outcomes.
Pricing
Airflow is free and open source, licensed under the Apache License 2.0. 
9. Kafka
Apache Kafka was created by LinkedIn and is now an open-source project mainly maintained by Confluent under the Apache stewardship. Kafka allows you to decouple your data streams and your systems. So your source systems will have your data in Apache Kafka and your target systems will source their data from Kafka in an ELT fashion.
You can have any data stream you like e.g. website events, pricing data, financial transactions, user interactions, etc. Once the data is in Kafka, you can put it in any system you like e.g similar to several other ELT Tools.
DatabaseAnalytics systemsEmail systemsAudit systems
Many companies are using Apache Kafka as their backbone. For example
Netflix uses Kafka to apply recommendations in real-time while watching TV shows.Uber uses Kafka to gather user, taxi, and trip data in real-time to compute and forecast demand, and also to compute surge pricing.LinkedIn uses Kafka to collect user interactions to make better connection recommendations in real-time.
Features
A distributed, resilient, and fault-tolerant architecture.Real-time stream processing, activity tracking, and application logs gathering.Horizontal scalability-LinkedIn has proven that it can scale to millions of messages per second.Extremely high performance (latency of less than 10ms) – real-time.Used by 2000+ firms, 35% of the Fortune 500 such as LinkedIn, Airbnb, Netflix, Uber, Walmart, etc.
Best-suited use case
Kafka works well with systems that have data streams to process. Kafka enables those systems to aggregate, transform & load into data stores as they occur. For example, Kafka is great for Log aggregation. You can use it to collect physical log files off servers and push those to a central repository (a data warehouse or file server) for processing in a classic ELT fashion. 
Drawbacks
Kafka is missing a complete set of management and monitoring ELT tools which is a deal-breaker for some organizations.Lack of pace in the development of new features.Zero data loss is still not guaranteed. Data retention is expensive because the data is often duplicated.A high number of brokers, partitions, and replications adds some serious complexity in the system and it often takes a while for developers to wrap their heads around all the pieces in the puzzle
Pricing
Kafka is one of the free and open-source tools, licensed under the Apache License 2.0. 
10. NiFi
Apache NiFi is a project that was initially developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA) to automate the flow of data between software systems. Similar to Airflow, NiFi is based on a concept called flow-based programming (FBP). NiFi performs a combination of Extraction, Loading, and Transformations between systems. It can operate within clusters and can be used to create both ELT and ETL workflows.
Features
Open-source.Easy to use data flow pipelines that send, receive, transfer, filter, and move data.Flow-based programming and a minimalist user interface.GUI can be customized based on specific needs.Visibility through end to end data flow monitoring.Pluggable, multi-tenant security.Highly extensible and you can build your own processors.It supports HTTPS, SSL, SSH, multi-tenant authorization, etc.Automated pipelines that require minimal manual intervention to operate.It has a version control system for data-flows.
Best-suited use case
NiFi is suited for processing both streaming data and batch load jobs. If you are looking for an ELT tool that has a minimalist UI, is versatile, and performs decently, then you should check out this tool.
Drawbacks
Lack of real-time monitoring tools.Failover is not supported by default.Horizontal scaling is hard to implement. Therefore, the more pragmatic approach here is to scale vertically through the use of larger instances.Resilience against server problems is not supported internally.
Pricing
NiFi is free and open-source, licensed under the Apache License 2.0. 
Cloud-Native ELT Tools and Open Source ELT Tools
Paid ELT Tools
If you have high data analytics ambitions, you need a modern data stack — connectors, cloud warehouse, and BI tools. Paid solutions are a great choice especially when you want to minimize the TCOs of equipment and maintenance costs. Today there are dozens of commercial SaaS ELT tools available. They are offering real-time streaming, monitoring and alerts, intelligent schema detection, and more.
Free ELT Tools
Like all fields of software development and infrastructure, ELT has seen its own surge of open source projects that are free to download and are licensed under an open-source license. Open source ELT tools are a cost-effective alternative to commercial solutions. They are a great fit for smaller projects that either lack the time and resources in-house to build a custom ELT solution — or the funding to purchase one.
