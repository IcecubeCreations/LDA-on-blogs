 ViewsWelcome readers, in this tutorial, we will learn the basics of different design patterns under the Microservices architecture.You can also check a tutorial in the following video:
Java Design Patterns Tutorial – video1. IntroductionBefore going any further in this tutorial I hope you understand what Microservices are and the principles behind them (such as Independent and Autonomous Services, Scalability, Decentralization, Availability, Isolation from Failures, Real-time Load Balancing, etc.). This will be an interesting long read. Have fun while reading!1.1 Aggregator Design PatternLet us take a look at this design pattern.This design pattern works on the mechanism where it aggregates the data from the different microservices and displays the result to the usersBased on the DRY principle. The Dry principle refers to the aggregation of business logic into composite microservices and aggregates that particular business logic into one serviceBeneficial when we need an output by combining the data from the multiple microservicesFig. 1: Aggregator design pattern1.2 API Gateway Design PatternLet us take a look at this design pattern.It is a design pattern that acts as a single point of contact for incoming requests, decides which microservice to send the request to get the data, and also helps in aggregation of data from different microservicesSupport authentication responsibility for microservicesCan covert the protocol request from one type to otherFig. 2: API Gateway design pattern/figcaption>1.3 Chain of Responsibility Design PatternLet us take a look at this design pattern.It is a design pattern where the output of 1 microservice acts as an input for other microserviceUses synchronous HTTP request or response for messagingThe disadvantage of this pattern is that the response time for a single output can be much longer and the recommendation is not to make any longer chainsFig. 3: Chain of Responsibility design pattern1.4 Asynchronous Messaging Design PatternLet us take a look at this design pattern.Interaction between the different microservices is not dependent on one and another and they do not have to communicate with each other sequentiallyFig. 4: Asynchronous Messaging design pattern1.5 Database or Shared Database Design PatternLet us take a look at this design pattern.This design pattern talks about that either a microservice will have its separate database or two or more microservices can share a common databaseSolve problems like:Like data duplication and inconsistencyDifferent services having different storage needsData denormalization through shared databases per servicesFig. 5: Database or Shared Database design pattern1.6 Event Sourcing Design PatternLet us take a look at this design pattern.This design pattern talks about generating an event for every event that has occurred in the database or changes in the application stateOffers to support auditing of who did what and when and helps in restoring the application state in case of a failureFig. 6: Event Sourcing design pattern1.7 Branch Pattern Design PatternLet us take a look at this design pattern.This design pattern talks about simultaneously processing the requests and responses from two or more independent microservicesRequests are not passed in a sequenceExtends the Aggregator design pattern and provides flexibility to produce responses from a single chain or multiple chains1.8 Command Query Responsibility Segregator (CQRS)Let us take a look at this design pattern.Used when we want to query for a specific dataThe application is divided into 2 parts: Command and QueryCommand part handles all the requests related to CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETEQuery part handles the materialized views which are updated through a sequence of events1.9 Circuit Breaker Design PatternLet us take a look at this design pattern.This design pattern is used to stop the process of request and response if the service is not workingIn this design pattern, when the number of failures crosses a threshold limit, the circuit breaker trips for a particular period, and all the attempts to invoke that service will fall in that particular period. Once that period is done, the circuit breaker will allow a limited number of requests to pass through & if success resume back to normal operation else it will show failure again and the time will beginOffers no exhaustion of network resources and user experience is kept on a good noteFig. 7: Circuit breaker design pattern2. Decomposition Design PatternLet us take a look at this design pattern:It talks about breaking an application into small autonomous units and is done logicallyThe application is broken down based on three thing’s i.e. Sub-domains of application, Business capability, and Strangler or Vine pattern2.1 Strangler Design PatternLet us take a look at this design pattern.It is a design pattern that offers a way to break the monolithic application into smaller autonomous unitsIt is a pattern to incrementally transform the monolithic application into microservices by replacing a particular functionality with a new service. Once the new functionality is ready, the old component is strangled, and the new service is put into the use and old component is decommissioned altogetherThis pattern helps to achieve the highest code quality, follow TDD for business logic, and SonarQube integration with the deploymentThis pattern follows 3 steps i.e. Transform (i.e. Develop new component independently), Co-exist (i.e. Let both new and old component exists), and Eliminate (i.e. Delete old component from Monolithic architecture)2.1.1 How to select which component(s) to Strangler/Refractor first?Select a simple component if you’re a newbie to this design pattern. This ensures practical knowledge, best practices, etc.If a component has good test coverage and less technical debt linked to itIf component which is better suited to the cloud and having scalability requirementsIf a component has frequence business requirements and requires frequent deploymentThat is all for this tutorial and I hope the article served you whatever you were looking for.
