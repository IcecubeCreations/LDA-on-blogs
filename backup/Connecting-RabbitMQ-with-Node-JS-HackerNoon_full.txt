A queue is the name for a post box which lives inside RabbitMQ. In this part of the tutorial we’ll write two small programs in Javascript; a producer that sends a single message, and a consumer that receives messages and prints them out. Express framework is used for routing the API for posting the data from RabbitMQ's postman. We can also create a queue from code. The queue should be ready in seconds.@programmingkiranSenior Full StackAbout @programmingRabbitMQ is a message broker: it accepts and forwards messages. You can think about it as a post office: when you put the mail that you want posting in a post box, you can be sure that Mr. or Ms. Mailperson will eventually deliver the mail to your recipient.

Although messages flow through RabbitMQ and your applications, they can only be stored inside a queue. A queue is only bound by the host’s memory & disk limits, it’s essentially a large message buffer. Many producers can send messages that go to one queue, and many consumers can try to receive data from one queue. Consuming has a similar meaning to receiving. A consumer is a program that mostly waits to receive messages:Note that the producer, consumer, and broker do not have to reside on the same host; indeed in most applications they don’t. An application can be both a producer and consumer, too.In this part of the tutorial we’ll write two small programs in Javascript; a producer that sends a single message, and a consumer that receives messages and prints them out.Step 1 : Installing Rabbit MQ on local machine.Install Rabbit MQ on local server.
