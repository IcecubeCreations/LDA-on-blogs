We are getting socket error EVERY week. So, NEVER AGAIN.Reply Stephen saysNovember 20, 2020 at 4:50 amI have the same problem with Polygon.When I make an API request to polygon, it give me 500 server error. It is a shame. It is impossible to use this data in production. Also, other endpoints are not working too for crypto and forex.Here you can see the error;https://i.imgur.com/fXzvXiB.pngReply Matt Bastille saysFebruary 9, 2021 at 1:39 amI would heavily recommend having a look at FactSet APIsEspecially for accurate sector data, geographic revenue exposure, estimates, ownership, and ESG data!Reply Nick Samon saysMarch 10, 2021 at 11:39 amTwelve API is extremely bad. So slow and it’s hard to understand their endpoints. Customer support is slow, bad, and disrespectful. I will never use it again. I’ve wasted my time and my money there.

They have a query and real-time stream API and an API to render article content.
