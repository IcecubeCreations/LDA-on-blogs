Adam,
I work on the WebSphere CDI team and am also a committer on Apache Open WebBeans. 
It is a misconception that WAS is bloated or requires expensive hardware. 
We only need Intel Pentium processor at 500 MHz or faster and Minimum 512 MB physical memory.
Your input is valued. I encourage you to play with the beta.
For installing WAS8 beta see
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/wasinfo/beta/topic/com.ibm.websphere.installation.express.doc/info/exp/ae/tins_installation_dist_gui.html
Our system requirements

  and

--Thanks,

I would agree with Rohit's comment that it is a misconception that WAS is "bloated".  I know Adam's comment is made in jest but certainly doesn't help the misconception.
I would also point out that WebSphere 7.0 introduced a new feature that would "provision" only the components that are required for applications deployed to a server.  Although the setting is disabled by default you can enable it and reduce the footprint of running unneeded services.  I believe this is a fairly unique feature not provided by any other server so you can get the "lightweight" server you want if you only deploy WARs but still have a fully Java EE compliant server for applications that need it.
More info is here:
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/ieduasst/v1r1m0/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.iea.was_v7/was/7.0/Performance/WASv7_RuntimeProvisioning/player.html
I will agree that WebSphere will not have the startup speed of Glassfish that Adam always likes to point out though.

@Stuart,
last year I had to install Java EE 5 (EJB 3) support for WebSphere (I guess 7). The file size was about ...1 GB. After the installation it was really fast and usable- what surprised me.
I will take a look at WAS 8. The first problem - the download procedure is not that obvious :).
Btw. one of my first projects was WAS in ~1998. It looked almost identical to Sun's Java Web Server :-)
thanks!,
adam
