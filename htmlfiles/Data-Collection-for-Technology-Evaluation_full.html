for Program Evaluation</span><!-- #EndEditable -->

<!-- #BeginEditable "body" --> 
<p>Evaluation should be a data-driven process. When considering how teachers use 
  and integrate technology or how students use technology to inspire and expand 
  learning, it is important to have <I>data</I> which documents this activity. 
  In this article, we will discuss several different data collection strategies 
  which can support a technology evaluation effort.</p>
<p>Before we dive into a discussion of particular strategies, it makes sense
  to  place data collection into the context of the evaluation and assessment
  initiatives  it supports. It is our contention that meaningful program evaluation
  - for instance in the realm of digital learning -- is about examining the impact
  that digital learning tools have on teaching and student achievement. This
  impact cannot be measured simply by &quot;counting
  devices&quot; nor
   for that matter entirely by counting teachers or students who simply &quot;use&quot; 
  their devices. Rather, we believe that impact is measured and documented through
   observation of a complex picture composed of teacher behavior, student work,
   attitudes, curriculum, <i>and</i> technology. </p>
<p>We have worked with school districts, educational organizations, and higher
   education institutions to develop authentic assessments of program impact
   that focus on teaching and learning. In virtually all cases, these assessments
   are rooted in the goals of a strategic plan such as a digital learning plan.
  Assuming that the plan goes beyond an outline for technical infrastructure
  and has a vision (and related goals) for programmatic impact in the classroom,
  it is possible to create descriptive indicators for the desired outcomes of
  the plan's goals. These indicators form a framework for data collection. In
  this way, data collected is intended to confirm the achievement (or lack thereof)
  of specific indicators. </p>
<p>A full description of our <a href="https://www.sun-associates.com/audits" target="_blank">evaluation
    process</a> 
  is available online. Sample focus group and interview questions can be <a href="../masscue/samplequestions.html" target="_blank">found
  here</a>. We also have <a href="../masscue/othertools.html" target="_blank">sample
  surveys and classroom observation protocols</a>. A list of other online resources
  related to technology evaluation is found at the end of this article.</p>
<h4 class="style1">Tying Data to Indicators</h4>
<P>Within the context of an evaluation effort, data collection makes use of tools 
  and techniques such as surveys, observations, interviews/focus groups, review 
  of teacher/student work, and public meetings. The point is to collect data which 
  relates to the developed indicators. Data collection is designed in response 
  to assessment rubrics developed by a district from their goals and objectives 
  for technology. The point of data collection is to gather information which 
  will enable the district to "answer" the evaluation questions and "score" their 
  performance on their rubrics. Therefore, it is not possible to predict a data 
  collection strategy without knowing something about a district's evaluation 
  rubrics.</P>
<P>For example, if an indicator of high achievement in teacher use of technology
   is that teachers will use technology to communicate with peers outside 
  of the district, then data is needed which shows the amount as well as qualitative
   substance of teacher online communications. This might include technical logs
   (e.g., how often do teachers access their email accounts); teacher surveys
  to  determine how often online communication is used and for what; and teacher
  interviews to determine the value placed upon virtual communication strategies.
  All of this quantitative <I>and </I>qualitative
   data is used to determine a level of overall achievement in the indicator
  rubric.  A similar logic would be used to measure achievement with any set
  of indicators. 
</P>
<P>We have found a variety of tools useful for technology evaluation data collection. 
</P>
<UL>
  <LI><a href="sample.html#surv"><b>Surveys</b></a> -- Surveys can be of teachers, 
    administrators, students, and/or community members. Unique surveys can created 
    for each target population. Survey formats can be secure online or hardcopy. 
    We have found considerable advantage in using online surveys in that they 
    often end up being easier for respondents.<a href="../surveyws/surveys.html"> 
    Online surveys</a> produce immediate machine-readable data (without additional 
    data processing). Regardless of whether a survey is online or hardcopy, we 
    have found that providing a common, dedicated, time for respondents to complete 
    their surveys is important. Many of our clients dedicate 10 minutes at the 
    beginning of a faculty meeting to completing an annual survey. One thing that 
    is clear is that the &quot;in your mailbox, return it to the Principal's office&quot; 
    paper survey is <i>guaranteed</i> to produce low response rates. </LI>
  <LI><b><a href="teacherfg.html">Focus Group Interviews</a></b> --As with surveys, 
    a district can choose to collect more or less data by scheduling more or fewer 
    focus groups. Typically, we interview teachers -- one group at each school 
    -- administrators, and technology staff. </LI>
  <LI><a href="clsobsv.html"><b>Classroom Observations</b></a> -- Our team of 
    external evaluators typically spends time in schools and classrooms throughout 
    the district. Our goal is not to only observe teachers and students using 
    technology. Rather, we find that we can learn much about how technology is 
    being used to impact teaching and learning just by observing classroom setups, 
    teaching styles, and student behaviors. The observation techniques we employ 
    can certainly be implemented by an internal staff evaluation team.</LI>
  <LI><b>Artifact Analysis</b> -- Our team will develop an assessment protocol 
    of student technology work. This assessment will focus on an examination of 
    how students at a variety of different grade levels and subject areas have 
    used technology to enrich content-area (curriculum) learning. We will work 
    with the evaluation committee and school administrators to develop an accurate 
    sample of student work for this assessment.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Here, it is worth mentioning that while data collection might take place at 
  the individual level of performance, individual data it should never be reported. 
  The mission of a district-wide evaluation is to determine the progress of the 
  district <I>as a group of individuals</I> in meeting its goals. Nothing will 
  undermine an evaluation project faster than the perception that it is measuring 
  or ranking individuals. If individual assessments are important, these should 
  be developed and administered separate from your district technology evaluation. 
</P>
<P>Other data collection strategies and mechanisms can be deployed. For example, 
  some districts have found success with a "public meeting" format where Sun
  Associates facilitates (and documents) a discussion about a community's goals,
  aspirations, and concerns. As a cost-saving strategy
  -- particularly in larger districts -- we can work with in-district evaluators
  to adapt and deploy existing data collection mechanisms and/or to identify
  statistically relevant sample populations so as create a more manageable data
  collection effort.</P>
<h4 class="style1">Triangulation</h4>
<P>A meaningful evaluation will never rely on a single data source (e.g., surveys). 
  Rather, you need to design and implement a data collection <I>strategy</I> which 
  has the optimum chance of capturing the big picture of technology's use and 
  impact your district. This is why we generally employ most, if not all, of the 
  above-mentioned data collection tools in any given evaluation project. We suggest 
  that districts &quot;triangulate&quot; their data findings. By this we mean 
  that a survey can be used to make a broad sweep of data. Then, an analysis of 
  the survey data can highlight particular issues which can be explored during 
  focus group interviews. Finally, themes and findings arising from the survey 
  and focus group data can be explored through &quot;walk arounds&quot; and classroom 
  observations. This represents the basic &quot;triangle&quot; of data collection. 
  Artifact analysis (examining student and/or teacher work product) adds yet another 
  valuable dimension to the whole data picture.</P>
<P>Another reason for implementing multiple data collection strategies is that 
  while surveys can generally reach a large percentage of your district staff/students/administrators, 
  they are rather limited in the amount of detail captured. In other words, you 
  can get a large sample with surveys but relatively little depth as compared 
  to labor-intensive yet data rich interviews and observations. </P>
<h4 class="style1">Data Analysis and Reporting</h4>
<P>Clearly the point of data collection is to support the development of evaluative 
  findings. This means scoring of rubrics and the creation of some sort of report 
  which provides a textual overview. Nevertheless, it is also useful and important 
  to share the summarized results of the data collection itself. We have found 
  that survey data and summarized focus group data can be powerful tools for building 
  and district decision-makers. In one example, a district technology coordinator 
  asked us to provide survey data -- from a district-wide survey aggregated to 
  the building level -- to site-based management teams. Teams were then able to 
  use this data to make decisions related to technology support, resource, and 
  professional development allocation in their individual schools.</P>
<P>Finally, it's important that the people who provide you with data -- e.g., 
  teachers, administrators, students, parents -- receive some tangible product 
  from their efforts. All too often teachers complete surveys which basically 
  &quot;vanish&quot; into some black hole of data collection. Over time, this 
  serves to create a large disincentive to cooperating with district data collection 
  efforts. It's a rather simple matter to provide respondents with a timely data 
  report that indicates how much you value their input.</P>
