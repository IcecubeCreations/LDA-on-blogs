    <h1>
      Principles of Design
    </h1>
    <p>
      Again and again we fall back on the folklore of the
      principles of good design. Sometimes I need a URI for them so
      this is started as collection of them. I have written about
      some in many places. Principles such as <b>simplicity</b> and
      <b>modularity</b> are the stuff of software engineering;
      <b>decentralization</b> and <b>tolerance</b> are the life and
      breath of Internet. Brian Carpenter has enumerated some
      principles of design of the Net [<a href=
      "Architecture.html#carpenter">carpenter</a>]. The third pair
      of ideas I have found commonly useful for the Web. I
      mentioned them in a keynote at WWW7 and the note on <a href=
      "Evolution.html">Evolvability</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is largely "motherhood and apple pie" but it still needs
      a home.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="KISS" id="KISS">Simplicity</a>
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Keep it simple, stupid!"
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Simplicity is easily to quote but often ignored in strange
      ways. Perhaps this is because it is the eye of the beholder.
    </p>
    <p>
      A language which uses fewer basic elements to achieve the
      same power is simpler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes simplicity is confused with 'easy to understand".
      For example, a two-line solution which uses recursion is a
      pretty simple, even though some people might find it easier
      to work though a 10-line solution which avoids recursion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In XML, "Processing Instructions", those things which start
      with "&lt;?" are <strong>not</strong> simple. They look
      simple, just an extra sort of thing in the language, but the
      complicate what was a very clean design of elements and
      attributes, and a complication in the underlying syntax is
      has great effect. All specifications which refer to XML
      processing will have to figure out what to do about
      processing instructions as well as elements.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="Modular" id="Modular">Modular Design</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      When you design a system, or a language, then if the features
      can be broken into relatively loosely bound groups of
      relatively closely bound features, then that division is a
      good thing to be made a part of the design. This is just good
      engineering. It means that when you want to change the
      system, you can with luck in the future change only one part,
      which will only require you to understand (and test) that
      part. This will allow other people to independently change
      other parts at the same time. This is just classic good
      software design and books have been written about it. The
      corollary, the TOII is less frequently met.
    </p>
    <p>
      Modular design hinges on the simplicity and abstract nature
      of the interface definition between the modules. A design in
      which the insides of each module need to know all about each
      other is not a modular design but an arbitrary partitioning
      of the bits.  <a href="Modularity.html">(More ...)</a>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="Modular2" id="Modular2">Being part of a Modular Design</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
        Its is not only necessary to make sure your own system is designed
        to be made of modular parts.  It is also necessary to realize that
        your own system, no matter how big and wonderful it seems now,
        should always be designed to be a <em>part</em> of another
        larger system.
    </p>
    <p>This is often much more difficult than modularity.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Tolerance">
      Tolerance
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Be liberal in what you require but conservative in what
        you do"
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This is the expression of a principle which applies pretty
      well in life, (it is a typical UU tenet), and is commonly
      employed in design across the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Write HTML 4.0-strict. Accept HTML-4.0-Transitional (a
      superset of strict).
    </p>
    <p>
      This principle can be contentious. When browsers are lax
      about what they expect, the system works better but also it
      encourages laxness on the part of web page writers. The
      principle of tolerance does not blunt the need for a
      perfectly clear protocol specification which draws a precise
      distinction between a conformance and non-conformance. The
      principle of tolerance is no excuse for a product which
      contravenes a standard.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Decentrali">
      Decentralization
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is a principle of the design of distributed systems,
      including societies. It points out that any single common
      point which is involved in any operation trends to limit the
      way the system scales, and produce a single point of complete
      failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Centralization in social systems can apply to concepts, too.
      For example, if we make a knowledge representation system
      which requires anyone who uses the concept of "automobile" to
      use the term "http://www.kr.org/stds/industry/automobile"
      then we restrict the set of uses of the system to those for
      whom this particular formulation of what an automobile is
      works. The Semantic Web must avoid such conceptual
      bottlenecks just as the Internet avoids such network
      bottlenecks.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="TOII" id="TOII">Test of Independent Invention</a>
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        If someone else had already invented your system, would
        theirs work with yours?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Does this system have to be the only one of its kind? This
      simple thought test is described in more detail in "<a href=
      "Evolution.html#TOII">Evolution</a>" in these Design Issues.
      It is connectted to modularity inside-out: designing a system not to be
      modular in itself, but to be a part of an as-yet unspecified
      larger system. A critical property here is that the system
      tries to do one thing well, and leaves other things to other
      modules. It also has to avoid conceptual or other
      centralization, as no two modules can claim the need to be
      the unique center of a larger system.

    <h2>
      <a name="PLP" id="PLP">Principle of Least Power</a>
    </h2>
    <p>
      In choosing computer languages, there are classes of program
      which range from the plainly descriptive (such as Dublin Core
      metadata, or the content of most databases, or HTML) though
      logical languages of limited power (such as access control
      lists, or <em>conneg</em> content negotiation) which include
      limited propositional logic, though declarative languages
      which verge on the Turing Complete (Postscript is, but PDF
      isn't, I am told) through those which are in fact Turing
      Complete though one is led not to use them that way (XSLT,
      SQL) to those which are unashamedly procedural (Java, C).
    </p>
    <p>
      The choice of language is a common design choice. The low
      power end of the scale is typically simpler to design,
      implement and use, but the high power end of the scale has
      all the attraction of being an open-ended hook into which
      anything can be placed: a door to uses bounded only by the
      imagination of the programmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Computer Science in the 1960s to 80s spent a lot of effort
      making languages which were as powerful as possible. Nowadays
      we have to appreciate the reasons for picking not the most
      powerful solution but the least powerful. The reason for this
      is that the less powerful the language, the more you can do
      with the data stored in that language. If you write it in a
      simple declarative from, anyone can write a program to
      analyze it in many ways. The Semantic Web is an attempt,
      largely, to map large quantities of existing data onto a
      common language so that the data can be analyzed in ways
      never dreamed of by its creators. If, for example, a web page
      with weather data has RDF describing that data, a user can
      retrieve it as a table, perhaps average it, plot it, deduce
      things from it in combination with other information. At the
      other end of the scale is the weather information portrayed
      by the cunning Java applet. While this might allow a very
      cool user interface, it cannot be analyzed at all. The search
      engine finding the page will have no idea of what the data is
      or what it is about. This the only way to find out what a
      Java applet means is to set it running in front of a person.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope that is a good enough explanation of this principle.
      There are millions of examples of the choice. I chose HTML
      not to be a programming language because I wanted different
      programs to do different things with it: present it
      differently, extract tables of contents, index it, and so on.
