<p>
The <a href="http://www.json.org/license.html">JSON license</a> is a
slightly modified variant of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a>, but that
variation has led it to be rejected as a free-software or open-source
license by several organizations.  The change is a simple—rather
innocuous at some level—addition of one line: "<span>The Software shall be
used for Good, not 
Evil.</span>".  Up until recently, code using the JSON license was
acceptable for Apache projects, but that line and the ambiguity it
engenders was enough for Apache to put it on the list of disallowed licenses.
</p>

<p>
At the end of October, Ted Dunning <a href="/Articles/707531/">brought
up</a> the license on the Apache legal-discuss mailing list.  He suggested
that classifying the JSON license as acceptable (i.e. on the list of <a
href="https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved#category-a">Category&nbsp;A</a>
licenses) was an "<span>erroneous decision</span>". That decision was made,
he said, "<span>apparently based on a determination that the
no-evil clause was 'clearly a joke'</span>". He pointed to a <a
href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-legal-discuss/200806.mbox/%3C510143ac0806060151u2602fa88x3a57e20e7a9e17f7@mail.gmail.com%3E">thread
from 2008</a> where a "<span>lazy consensus</span>" <a
href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/www-legal-discuss/200806.mbox/%3C510143ac0806081045nabc5bd0h512fde99551aac60@mail.gmail.com%3E">formed</a>
that the "not evil"
condition did not preclude Apache projects from using the license.
</p>

<p>
But Dunning pointed out that some of his customers' legal teams are not
getting the "joke".  As a license term, "good not evil" leaves quite a bit
to be desired:
<div class="BigQuote">
To me, all of this clearly shows that the json license is substantially hindering
downstream adoption due to a perception by those downstream consumers that you
can't put a joke into a license. I, frankly, agree with those folks. Not doing evil is a good
thing and I try to do that myself, but having to get a legal opinion that everything I do is
not evil would make it impossible to get anything done.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Dunning suggested that the license be moved to <a
href="https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved#category-x">Category&nbsp;X</a>,
which contains licenses that cannot be used by Apache projects.  Multiple
replies in the thread made it clear there is no real support for the license and
plenty of interest in seeing it be banned.  In fact, Apache's vice
president of legal affairs,  Jim Jagielski, <a
href="/Articles/707586/">decided</a> to ban the license on
November&nbsp;3.  He <a href="/Articles/707587/">explained</a> his
reasoning in a post two days earlier:
<div class="BigQuote">
It is not a valid FSF nor OSI
license. As such, it is not a true "open source" license
and has no place as CatA [Category&nbsp;A].
</div>
</p>

<p>
But, simply removing the license from the approved list doesn't magically
fix the projects that depend on code using it.  Dunning had a list
of around a dozen Apache projects that may depend on JSON-licensed code;
there may well be others.
He also pointed to a Debian web page <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/qa.debian.org/jsonevil">listing alternative
JSON implementations</a>.  But work needs to be done to switch projects to
acceptable alternatives—and that will take time.
</p>

<p>
Apache projects cannot make releases using code that is covered by a
Category&nbsp;X license, so any that depend on JSON-licensed code need to
fix that.  Alan Gates <a href="/Articles/707661/">wondered</a> if there
could be some kind of grace period for projects to come into compliance.
He noted that the <a href="https://hive.apache.org/">Apache Hive</a> data
warehousing project is in the middle of trying to get out a maintenance
release, which would be blocked by the change; others may be similarly
affected.  Furthermore:
<div class="BigQuote">
The amount of time to fix this will not be trivial.  Based on a little
bit of digging I've done the alternatives are not 100% identical in their
behavior which will mean projects will need to thoroughly test the
replacements and change their code to deal with the differences.
</div>
</p>

<p>
He and Jagielski had spoken about the matter and the latter had suggested
perhaps adding a "<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_clause">grandfather
clause</a>" that would allow projects that already use JSON-licensed code
to continue to make releases for some period of time.  Gates proposed six
months as that time frame.  In general, that idea was popular, but there
were some wrinkles.
</p>

<p>Dunning
<a href="/Articles/707664/">would like to see</a> a much shorter deadline
for resolving the license problem.  He has done some work to make it easier
for projects to switch to a properly licensed alternative, but there is still
a lot of testing that needs to 
be done to ensure everything works correctly.  Gates <a
href="/Articles/707665/">asked</a> if a six-month period would really
matter given that the license has been present in Apache products for 
years, but Dunning is <a href="/Articles/707666/">concerned</a> that Apache
projects are losing users over it:
<div class="BigQuote">
We are already seeing users reject Apache software because of this
issue. So yes, it will matter. The question is how much and how do we trade
that off against the pain involved.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There are other considerations, though.  Andrew Wang <a
href="/Articles/707668/">said</a> that the <a
href="https://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop</a> framework for big data
processing relies on third-party libraries that use JSON-licensed
code. "<span>We can't simply swap it out.</span>"  In addition, enterprise
software is expected to only make bug fixes for multiple years, he <a
href="/Articles/707673/">said</a>, so
switching libraries will be problematic from that perspective:
<div class="BigQuote">
I'll add that typical EOLs [end of life] for enterprise software is measured in multiple years. If I had my druthers, we'd grandfather in existing release lines where bumping json.org would affect compatibility and thus EOL expectations. Failing that, giving us at least
until June would be significant.
</div>
</p>

<p>
There was a fair amount of discussion of how various projects could proceed
to remove the dependency on JSON-licensed code, but no clear consensus
emerged on how disruptive the change would be.  Enough of a consensus on
having a grace period of some length did emerge, however, to the point that
Jagielski <a href="/Articles/707707/">issued a statement</a> that
prohibited projects from adding JSON license dependencies, but allowed
others some time to make the change:
<div class="BigQuote">
If you have been using it, and have done so in a *release*,
    AND there has been NO pushback from your community/eco-system,
    you have a temporary exclusion from the Cat-X classification thru
    April 30, 2017. At that point in time, ANY and ALL usage
    of these JSON licensed artifacts are DISALLOWED. You must
    either find a suitably licensed replacement, or do without.
    There will be NO exceptions.
</div>
</p>

<p>
It is, in some ways, surprising that it has taken this long for Apache to
tackle this particular license problem.  Other organizations have banned
the license for years and Apache is rather notoriously picky about
licenses.  The "determination" that it was a joke clause back in 2008 seems
a bit strange, in truth.  But "<span>there has been no real 'outcry' over our
usage of it, especially from end-users and other consumers of
our projects which use it</span>", Jagielski said, which may explain why it
hadn't been addressed until now. 
</p>

<p>
It is likely that few would admit to using the JSON-licensed code for
"evil" (however <i>that</i> is defined), but that isn't really the crux of
the matter.  Legal departments are understandably leery of how
<i>others</i> (and courts, in particular) might interpret the clause.  It
is quite ambiguous and corporate legal teams go to great lengths to avoid
that kind of thing when they can.  Given that Apache projects are used at
lots of large companies, it is perhaps also surprising that the outcry wasn't
louder than it is even today.
</p>

<p>
Several in the thread wondered about getting the license's author, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Crockford">Douglas
Crockford</a>, to change it.  That was deemed unlikely by Jagielski and Sam
Ruby, who have both discussed it with him multiple times.  Crockford has
given at least one <a
href="http://dev.hasenj.org/post/3272592502/ibm-and-its-minions">license
exception</a> in the past ("<span>I give permission for IBM, its customers,
partners, and minions, to use JSLint for evil.</span>"), though no one
suggested pursuing that path for Apache projects.

<p>
But letting the issue linger certainly had a cost for the projects that
depended on that code.  It would, it seems, have been far better to grasp
the nettle some time ago.  In the end, though, by mid-2017 the problem
should be resolved, hopefully with minimal disruption.

For some of the code affected by the JSON license, people have tracked down a version derived from one that includes an exception to the clause, and built their code upon that version.

While I appreciate and respect Crockford's position on "The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil", such ambiguous language has no place in a software license, or any license for that matter. Good and Evil are inherently subjective words. Employees at NSA would tell you that what they were doing by spying on American citizens was good. Their intentions were good. They watched over the citizenry. They investigated illegal activity by monitoring computer networks. They strategically withheld security vulnerabilities to aid in fighting the enemy. Many people, however, consider their actions evil. They spied on U.S. citizens. They hacked personal and corporate computer systems. They withheld 0day exploits for offensive purposes instead of disclosing them responsibly.<br>
<p>
There are always at least two sides to everything. What is good and what is evil is simply a matter of perspective. The JSON license fails to acknowledge reality preferring, naively, to believe that everything is black or white, good or evil.<br>

Wow, serious efforts to miss the point. Let me try again: how many people find it evil to catch and rescue someone accidentally falling off a cliff?<br>
<p>
The point is: yes of course the concepts of Good and Evil aren't identical for everyone. This doesn't mean the concepts are completely void and useless; they do have a lot of universality. Pretending the concepts of Good and Evil are meaningless is just as extreme and stupid than pretending they mean the exact same for everyone. The real world is complex but that doesn't mean we can't say anything about it.<br>

Hey marcH. It is true that some (not most) actions can be universally classified as either good or evil. But that's not remotely sufficient. It is necessary that *all* (or the vast majority) of actions can be so classified, unambiguously and trivially, before the action is taken. Otherwise, any one abiding by the terms doesn't know which actions they can or cannot take. If they make a classification error even once, in any of the hundreds of actions they might perform every day, then they are wide open to anybody with a different classification accusing them of breaching the terms.<br>

It seems a pity that this discussion seems limited to legal issues rather than what would seem on the face of it to be the intent behind the smiling face of the clause, which is to bear in mind an ethical aspect to software and its use.  One can understand why the issue is reduced to a legal one above others, but as in other areas of life, surely software development can bear a bit of ethical self-scrutiny without it becoming a binary legal outcome.<br>

A license is a legal document that determines what you're allowed to do or not do.  Grossly ambiguous text like this has no place in a legal document.  It's unethical - and possibly evil - to release such grossly ambiguous text in a license.<br>

    <p><i>such ambiguous language has no place in a software license, or any license for that matter</i></p>

<p>I can't agree. It's Douglas's code. He can license it how he sees fit. There's no obligation on him that a license be convenient for lawyers or that a license be a free software license. The license isn't pretending to be something it isn't, so there's no misrepresentation. If clarity is your requirement then no one forces use of this code.</p>

<p>I'm not even convinced that this is poor legal procedure. For example,  summary judgment against this license seems unlikely, since the nature of evil and a licensee's compliance with non-evil are matters of fact.</p>

<p>
Allow me to rephrase. While the law does indeed say that it is Douglas's code and he can license it however he sees fit, such ambiguous language has no place in a license for software you actually want other people to *use*. Perhaps Douglas does not intend for the code to be used by anyone other than himself, and that is perfectly fine. However, the ambiguous license language makes the software toxic to anyone else, legally speaking: it is impossible to know whether one will later be found to have complied with the license or held liable for copyright infringement. If he wants the software to be adopted by others (and why else would he release it with an almost-open license?) then his purpose would be best served by leaving out the ambiguous language.<br>

It is good that the Apache Software Foundation is picking this up. To me the license is clearly non-free, which is known for a while (by FSF and OSI).<br>
<p>
I think the lesson to be learned here is similar to what is known about software defects: Fixing licensing problems early is less expensive.<br>
<p>
However sometimes legal issues are put forward for other reasons and should be ignored for practical reasons, so it cannot easily be detected if a licensing issue at hand is a real problem.<br>
<p>
For the jslint license it has become clear a while ago that Mr Crockford does not are much about real Free Software down stream usage. Most products use the javascript parsing part. An alternative javascript parser linker is <a href="http://eslint.org">http://eslint.org</a> .<br>

I see this as a politically difficult, but most welcome, movement.<br>
<p>
This joke-in-a-license (or joke-of-a-license? Am I doing evil here?) has been already disapproved for Debian. Debian is well known for its uncompromising attitude towards licenses, and several projects have been convinced to choose a saner or less controversial licensing scheme because of Debian's arguments.<br>
<p>
In this case, this was not enough (at least for most projects still carrying it). the Apache Foundation is another very well known name in this regard, and very well recognized as a top player when it comes to the Web world (although clearly it does not stop with that alone).<br>
<p>
Yes, many projects won't change, and we are likely to be stuck with the JSON license for good. However, this position statement might push many other projects to choose a sane licensing. Probably it will help push other important projects to a similar decision.<br>
<p>
Slowly, at least, this will push the JSON license to fringe, unimportant projects. And the world will be a better, saner place. Yay!<br>

It is fortunate that these problems principally affect Apache Project packages.  Since "Apache is where projects go to die", it affects mainly moribund projects.  Among those I include Ooo and everything Java, which seem to land at Apache almost by default, and which often have not yet formally noticed they are dead -- even those that started out that way.<br>
<p>
It is good to the degree that it hastens those deaths, but bad when actually dealing with it, instead, consumes effort better spent on projects that have a future.<br>

I don't see how any rational enginneer can consider Apache Hadoop or Cassandra dead (A rather large mass of Apache &amp; Java, with a considerable ecosystem both free &amp; commercial - &gt; 1 billion$ - around both). There are even products I've personally recommended against using (Tomcat and any J2EE stuff) that I can't see how you would think are "dead". <br>

 I have also packaged this onto Maven and made a number of changes to make it easier to port to. Notably, JSONException is now unchecked. See github.com/tdunning/open-json (also available via maven) – Ted Dunning yesterday <br>
<p>
This should make adoption even easier.<br>
<p>
Now JSHint/JSLint are harder to replace, but I’d say throw them into Crackford’s face and just remove them from the face of the world.<br>

    While I believe in objective good and evil, this is awful. Especially when we leave it to the courts to ascertain what is good and what is evil.

This reminds me of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://lwn.net/2001/0531/a/ipfilter-gone.php3">something Theo de Raadt said back in 2001</a> in the context of the IPFilter controversy:

<blockquote> But software
which OpenBSD uses and redistributes must be free to all (be they
people or companies), for any purpose they wish to use it, including
modification, use, peeing on, or even integration into baby mulching
machines or atomic bombs to be dropped on Australia.</blockquote>
