In almost every profession, choosing the right tool to perform the basic
functions can be a complex decision. For developers, there are dozens of
messaging services to choose from. A common question is which service to use,
RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka. This article will present use cases and
functionality of both platforms to help you make an informed decision.
</div>
<p></p>
<p>
Putting all the noise aside from fans of each service, who make it seem like
their way is the only choice, this article will serve as an authoritative
answer based on experience and knowledge of both systems. The insights shared
in this article are based on in-depth discussions with experienced developers
who had sound reasons for choosing one service over another.
</p>
<h2>
The Terms
</h2>
<p>
Both systems are message queues, though Kafka refers to their queue as a log.
To simplify the information for better comparison, this article will refer to
queues for both services. Messages in Kafka are often called records, but
again, to simplify, this article will only refer to messages. Kafka also uses
the word topic, which is essentially a categorization inside a queue.
Topics are divided into partitions containing sequential records that cannot
be changed.
</p>
<h2>
The Similarities
</h2>
<p>
Both RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka pass messages between producers and consumers
through queues (topics). Messages can include any kind of information, such as
a simple text message that triggers a chain of events on other applications.
A messaging system is ideal for building a microservice platform, connecting
different components, passing work onto remote workers, and real-time data
streaming.
</p>
<p>
Both message services are considered mature, with RabbitMQ on the market since
2007 and Kafka operating since 2011. The reliability and scalability of both
services are on pretty much equal footing, which is why the two are often
compared. The differences between the two and your applications needs are what
dictate which service to use when.
</p>
<h2>
The Main Difference
</h2>
<p>
Unlike most messaging systems, Kafka’s queue is persistent. This means that
data sent to Kafka is stored until a specific time period has passed or a size
limit has been reached. Until one of those two things happens, the message
remains in the queue even after it is consumed. In Kafka, messages can be
replayed or consumed multiple times; an adjustable setting useful in different
scenarios.
</p>
<p>
RabbitMQ, on the other hand, stores messages until a receiving application
connects to the queue and receives it. The client can acknowledge the message
at that point or when the processing is complete; either way, once the message
is acked, it’s gone from the queue.
</p>
<h2>
To replay or not to replay
</h2>
<p>
It is possible to replay messages in Kafka, meaning that your application can
read a message multiple times. Taking advantage of the ability
to replay a message in Kafka should be done
mindfully. For example, saving a customer order multiple times is not usually
a good idea. On the other hand, say your consumer has a bug and a newer
version needs to be deployed. Being able to reprocess some or all of the
messages at that point is a large benefit.
</p>
<p>
Messages in RabbitMQ can not be replayed, since they are removed once they are
ack:ed. However, a RabbitMQ client can nack (negative acknowledgement) a
message when it fails to handle the message; this is useful in case of a
temporary failure on the consumer side. The message will simply be added back
to the queue.
</p>
<h2>
Protocol
</h2>
<p>
Another difference between RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka is the protocol. While
RabbitMQ supports several different protocols such as AMQP, MQTT, STOMP, etc.,
Kafka uses a custom protocol on top of TCP/IP to communicate between the
applications and the cluster. RabbitMQ’s versatility in protocol gives it the
advantage in more scenarios over Kafka.
</p>
<h2>
Routing
</h2>
<p>
The complexity with which messages are routed is another difference between
the two message services. While RabbitMQ has a more complex routing method,
Kafka is very simple. Simple is good, right? Not in this case; one of the
biggest benefits of RabbitMQ is the flexibility it has to route messages.
</p>
<p>
RabbitMQ has four different options for routing messages - direct, topic,
fanout, and header exchanges. Direct exchanges route the message to all queues
that match its routing key exactly. Topics allow for wildcard matching and
exact matching through a routing key. Fanout exchanges broadcast messages to
every queue that is bound to the exchange. Header exchanges use the
information found in the message headers and optional values, very similar to
topic exchanges but without the routing keys.
See
<a href='/blog/part4-rabbitmq-for-beginners-exchanges-routing-keys-bindings.html'>
this article
</a>
for more information on different exchange types.
</p>
<p>
Kafka, on the other hand, does not support routing and instead relies upon
partitions that contain messages in a sequence that is completely unchangeable.
Creating your own dynamic routing with the help of Kafka streams is an option
but not a default with Kafka and requires the use of consumer groups and
persistent topics.
</p>
<h2>
Priority
</h2>
<p>
In RabbitMQ, a queue can be set up to have a range of priorities. Depending
on the message’s priority, it is placed in the appropriate queue.
</p>
<p>
In Kafka, a message cannot be sent with a priority level, nor can it be
delivered in priority order. All messages in Kafka are treated as equals and
delivered in the order in which they are received no matter how busy the
consumer is.
</p>
<h2>
Acking
</h2>
<p>
Acknowledgment - or acking - is the signal two processes give each other of
receipt of the message sent or handled. Both RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka support
producer acknowledgments to confirm messages have safely reached the broker.
In RabbitMQ, a message can be considered delivered once it is sent or when it
has been received by the consumer. Conversely, RabbitMQ clients can also nack
(negative acknowledge) a message if it fails to be handled, returning it to
the queue as if it were new.
</p>
<p>
Kafka maintains an offset for each message in a partition, with the committed
position the last offset saved. If the process fails and restarts, it is this
offset that it will recover to. Consumers in Kafka can commit offsets
periodically or manually. How this is kept track of differs in different
versions of Kafka.
</p>
<h2>
Queue speed
</h2>
<p>
For RabbitMQ, the speed of the queue is at its greatest when the queue is
empty. Kafka is designed for holding large volumes of messages, so emptiness
is not a factor in the speed. Enabling lazy queues in RabbitMQ is a great way
to make a more stable cluster if you think your consumers won’t keep up with
the speed of the publishers.
</p>
<h2>
Scaling
</h2>
<p>
Both RabbitMQ and Kafka are scalable in their own ways, giving you the ability
to adjust the number of consumers, the power of the broker, or add more nodes
as required.
</p>
<h3>
Consumers
</h3>
<p>
Publishing faster than your consumers perform in RabbitMQ may lead to the
queue growing into millions of messages and eventually running out of memory.
In this case, scaling the number of consumers that are handling the message is
an easy way to accommodate this scenario. Each queue in RabbitMQ can have many
consumers, who can all compete to consume the messages on the queue.
</p>
<p>
Kafka requires topic partitions to distribute consumers more efficiently,
where each consumer in a group is dedicated to one or more partitions.
Partitions can be set to send different sets of messages depending on the
user id, location, or other factors.
</p>
<h3>
Scaling broker
</h3>
<p>
Kafka has the advantage when it comes to scaling. It's build with large
scaling in mind. Adding more nodes to the cluster or adding more partitions to
the topics are easy ways to scale up in Kafka. In RabbitMQ, vertical
scaling - adding more power - is the easiest way
to scale up. Because there will always be a limit on how massive the machines
you can buy are, the horizontal scaling in Kafka is an advantage.
</p>
<p>
However, both message services can support large message volumes per second
without any issues, as the scale where RabbitMQ or Kafka would run out of
space is a rare scenario.
</p>
<h2>
Log compaction (Kafka as a Database)
</h2>
<p>
This does not exist in RabbitMQ but is a feature that makes Apache Kafka stand
out. Log compaction ensures that the last known value for each message key is
kept within the queue for a single topic partition. In other words, Kafka
keeps the latest version of a message, deleting the older versions that have
the same key.
</p>
<p>
Log compaction ensures that the latest information is available immediately,
such as if we are showing the latest status of one cluster among thousands
running. Instead of storing whether a cluster is responding or not each and
every time, only the final status is stored.
</p>
<h2>
Monitoring
</h2>
<p>
RabbitMQ’s interface allows for monitoring and handling of the server from a
web browser, including queues, connections, channels, exchanges, users,
permissions and more can be created, deleted, and listed in the interface.
While there are open-source and commercial tools available for monitoring
administering Kafka, they are separate. Find more information about the tools
available
<a href='https://medium.com/@giorgosmyrianthous/overview-of-ui-monitoring-tools-for-apache-kafka-clusters-9ca516c165bd'>
here.
</a>
</p>
<h2>
Push/Pull
</h2>
<p>
In RabbitMQ, messages are pushed to the consumer, making a prefetch limit
configuration necessary to prevent the consumer from becoming overwhelmed by
too many messages. Pulling messages from RabbitMQ is possible, but not
recommended. Kafka uses a pull model, where consumers request messages in
batches from an offset.
</p>
<h2>
License
</h2>
<p>
Both RabbitMQ and Kafka are free and open-source software licenses. Kafka
components such as Rest Proxy, Schema Registry, and KSL are covered by another
license called Confluent Community License, which still allows for free
download, modification, and redistribution, but does not allow anyone to
provide the software as a service (SaaS) offering. If Kafka changes the
license again to something stricter, RabbitMQ will have the advantage of
being easily replaceable by another AMQP broker while Kafka will not have
this advantage.
</p>
<h2>
Complexity
</h2>
<p>
The opinion of the developers we work with is that Kafka’s architecture is
more complex, as it includes more concepts such as topics, partitions, and
message offsets. Being familiar with consumer groups and handling offsets is
a prerequisite of working with Kafka. Failure handling, in particular, is a
complication of working with Kafka, which requires more time and is more
complicated than in RabbitMQ.
</p>
<h2>
Ecosystem
</h2>
<p>
Kafka is more than a broker - it is a streaming platform with many different
tools that can be integrated outside the main platform. These tools include
Kafka Core, Kafka Streams, Kafka Connect, Kafka REST Proxy, and the Schema
Registry. Most of these additional tools come from Confluent, which is not a
part of Apache.
</p>
<p>
The benefit of these tools is that a huge system can be configured before it
becomes necessary to write any code whatsoever. In the case of Kafka Connect,
integrating other data sources with Kafka expands processing and storage
capabilities quickly and easily. Kafka REST proxy adds the possibility of
receiving metadata from a cluster and produce or consumer messages over a
simple REST API, a feature easily enabled from the cluster control panel.
</p>
<h2>
Use Cases
</h2>
<p>
After all the information about what each system can or can’t do, here are
some use cases that have been written after real customer experiences with
the RabbitMQ and Kafka, and why they decided on one over the other.
</p>
<h3>
Use Cases - RabbitMQ
</h3>
<p>
Two main use cases stand out to make the choice for RabbitMQ: long-running
tasks and integration between microservice applications. In general, however,
RabbitMQ is a simple and traditional pub/sub message broker. It will scale
more than most systems will require it to and is easy to use immediately after
installation. RabbitMQ is also a good choice for systems with simple
requirements and those that do not need retention and streaming.
</p>
<h4>
Long-running tasks
</h4>
<p>
Message queues are, by nature, asynchronous processing of data - meaning that
they allow messages to be placed in queues without dealing with it
immediately. An example of such a scenario is a image scaling service that
allows users to upload images on a website, with the intention of
scaling the image and emailing it back to the user. Event-based microservice
architectures handling hundreds of millions of users are perfect for RabbitMQ.
</p>
<h4>
Integration between applications
</h4>
<p>
Services like MapQuest, supporting 23.1 million unique mobile users on a
monthly basis, rely on RabbitMQ to support topics spread over multiple queues.
In acting as the middle-man for communication between applications, RabbitMQ
enables systems to avoid bottlenecks when passing messages back and forth.
</p>
<h3>
Use Cases - Apache Kafka
</h3>
<p>
The perfect framework for storing, reading, re-reading, and analyzing
streaming data is where Apache Kafka is the better choice. Systems that are
audited or that need to permanently store messages are where Kafka is right
at home.
</p>
<h4>
Analysis, tracking, ingestion, logging, security
</h4>
<p>
In all of these scenarios, large amounts of data must be collected, stored,
and handled. Platforms that need to provide search features, analysis, or
auditing of large amounts of data are completely satisfied with the
performance of Kafka. Going back to the roots of Kafka, it was originally
meant to track website activity such as page views, uploads, and other user
actions.
</p>
<p>
With Kafka, producers send data to a single place, where it is then taken
charge of by a host of backend services that consume the data as required.
Major data analytical systems and storage/search systems integrate their
functions with Kafka.
</p>
<h4>
Real-Time processing
</h4>
<p>
The high-throughput capacity of a Kafka system pushes streams of data into
the target services, which are pulling the data through in real-time.
Publishing services like Spotify and Rabobank publish information using the
real-time services of Kafka. High-throughput and real-time combine to equal a
powerful application for logs, metrics, and more.
